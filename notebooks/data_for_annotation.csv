1k8udoi,End of the semester: How much empathy can one give?,"Although this is my 4th semester, I am still new to all this. Over the past couple years, my class size has increased. This semester I have about 165 students in my largest class. One thing that I have learned is that students love to wait til the end of the semester to share life‚Äôs circumstances. I understand trying to push through it, but I have asked them to let me know when things happen instead waiting til the end.

Their semester paper was posted in the syllabus with the due date. I told them over a month ago that they should be working on it. This is a huge assignment and requires me and my teaching assistants to devote a lot of time to it on top of catching up on grading other things. The long emails about ‚Äúcan we meet to discuss this?‚Äù From folks with multiple missing assignments or no assignments turned in at all are rolling in and I am already exhausted. 

One student even accused me of something that I didn‚Äôt do in order to get an extension. Of course I defended myself but I just gave in for the extension. 

Oh I was not feeling well the day it was due. Oh I was out of town the day it was due. Sigh. 

Like most of us, I have in my syllabus that doctors notes are a valid excuse. But the, ‚ÄúI have been sick all semester‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMy grandpa has been sick since January and it‚Äôs taken a toll on me all semester‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have been sick several times this semester, here‚Äôs my collection of doctors notes now allow me to make up everything even though grades are due next week‚Äù. All of these things are very valid BUT why didn‚Äôt you tell me this early on? The big issue for me is timing. I‚Äôm grateful for the students who send me an email several days before the assignment is due to tell me it‚Äôs a bad mental health week, I need more time. Sure! No problem. 

How do I handle this with care and boundaries for myself? How do YOU handle this time of the semester when the excuses start rolling in? I don‚Äôt care about being ‚Äúliked‚Äù but I do want to be careful and considerate. The longer I‚Äôm in this profession the harder it‚Äôs getting to brave this time of the semester üò©",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1k8udoi/end_of_the_semester_how_much_empathy_can_one_give/
1lhwct6,What are other careers for medicine that you can do other than being a traditional doctor?,"‚Äôm not against becoming a doctor, but I want to make sure I keep all my options open. I‚Äôve just entered my clinical years, and I‚Äôm already feeling somewhat burned out.

Currently, I‚Äôm on a neurology inpatient rotation, and I really enjoy it. We‚Äôre typically done around 2 PM and get close to an hour for lunch. My resident gives me the chance to see a patient on my own and then I present to the attending. It honestly reminds me of the show *Suits*‚Äîthat back-and-forth professional dynamic‚Äîand I really like that aspect of medicine. Can't wait to do that with a different rotation. It like trying a different flavor in an ice cream shop. 

Still, I recognize I‚Äôm seeing a ‚Äúhighlight reel‚Äù of the profession. I don‚Äôt fully know what my attending is doing behind closed doors‚Äîcharting, admin work, insurance battles, or other responsibilities that aren't visible to me.

Before this, I was on a neurosurgery rotation, and it was a completely different experience. I was waking up at 4 AM and working until 3 PM with no actual lunch breaks‚Äîjust a granola bar to get me through. On the plus side, I lost some weight, but I knew almost immediately that neurosurgery wasn‚Äôt for me. The lifestyle was too extreme and not aligned with what I want long-term. And they were being generous to me because they worked until 7 pm daily. And they had on call for 2 weekends in a roll. 

What I do know is that I value balance**.** I want a career where I can have time for hobbies like rock climbing and working out. I also want to be present for my future family‚Äîto attend my kids' basketball games, not just provide financially but be *there*.

Before choosing medicine, I considered engineering, but that also comes with challenges‚Äîlong hours, fear of layoffs, and navigating corporate politics. I actually worked at a science research company before med school. It was a standard 9‚Äì5 job, paid around $60K, and the work was simple. But there was zero upward mobility‚Äîmost people quit after six months because the job involved nothing more than spinning blood samples. That lack of growth and stimulation pushed me toward medicine.

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:

I'm in third year, enjoying aspects of clinical rotations, but also already feeling the weight of the path ahead. I‚Äôm aware that medicine can be rewarding, but I also don‚Äôt want to blindly follow a path that could lead to burnout or resentment. I want to stay open-minded.

**My questions are:**

* What career paths can someone take with an MD besides traditional clinical practice?
* Does my reasoning for keeping my options open make sense, or am I just overwhelmed by the transition into clinical training?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lhwct6/what_are_other_careers_for_medicine_that_you_can/

jj62q6,"Pro tip for those 11th hour ""student has a 13%, has done nothing all semester, and asks if they can do makeup work"" emails","I used to get these emails and I would spend countless hours jumping through hoops to help students by creating alternative assignments (since the answers were often already out there by this point) and most of the time they don't do it anyway. Or at least not enough to make a real dent in anything. Or I know the student won't actually do it and have said no and then wind up having to go meet with my Chair after the student complains and gives some type of sob story (some which may actually be valid but that doesn't mean the student is going to actually do the work). I'm always happy to go above and beyond to help a student who is actually willing to do the work but 99 times out of 100, if they haven't done the work all semester, they aren't going to start now. So I have started doing the following and I swear by this... I have had so much less drama. So here's my go-to...

I say yes **but** under the following conditions:

1. Student must have a meeting (virtually now) with an academic support coach to address the issues regarding why they are having trouble keeping up with their academic work. I then need 2 paragraphs sharing a specific plan for what they plan to do differently going forward and how they are going to implement that. 
2. I need a written plan for specific due dates of when they plan to turn in each item that I need to agree to before moving forward. (I wouldn't say no to anything other than ""turn everything in the last day of class"" ... I don't have time for that kind of grading at that point). 

If they meet the above criteria, student may get 70% credit for any item that they turn in on the dates that we agreed to (speeches and exams are an exception... they can't get back credit for those). 

Best case: they have a chance to reevaluate why they are struggling and make a plan for themselves going forward and can get back on track  
Worst case: they do nothing and I didn't waste a ton of time 

Do you know how many students have actually taken me up on this? One. In my entire teaching career. And I was actually really glad she did... she was a fall athlete in her first semester of college who was just drowning. She had been an honors student in high school but was taking far too many classes, in a major that was a horrible fit for her (her parents were pushing her to do it), and just overall overwhelmed trying to balance school and a crazy schedule. She had a 'come to Jesus' moment at the end of that semester and even sat out a few games to catch up. I just wrote her recommendation for grad school (without a single reservation... she really turned it around). 

I have a standard email that I copy and paste every time I get one of these with the above stipulations and it's saved me hours and hours and hours of headaches.

1jdvr2z,Kinda thinking of ditching trucking to get a bachelor‚Äôs degree,"For some context, I didn‚Äôt really try in high school lol. I ended up with a 2.47 GPA and got a 19 on the ACT. I‚Äôm also currently 23, so I graduated HS in 2020. Never once brought work home from school from middle school and beyond lol. I think I could‚Äôve done much better, I never necessarily struggled with my work, it was more so of a not paying attention, not taking notes, sleeping in class, being stoned out of my found issue. 

As an adult my life has changed a lot, I won‚Äôt go to far into it but I had some pretty severe mental health issues as a teenager which led to me do self destructive things. For some reason entering adulthood my outlook on life took a complete 180, especially after moving out of my parent‚Äôs house, moving from Wisconsin to Southern California, finding some actual success in life and realizing how good it can feel. 

At the moment I‚Äôm a class A truck driver, I actually enjoy doing it too but I think I‚Äôm capable of more. I also think that driving all day long and not really working aside people takes a major toll on me, I feel like I never have time for anything and I‚Äôm constantly exhausted. I make $28 an hour with just shy of 2 years of experience and my job isn‚Äôt over the road, it‚Äôs a local gig out of Irwindale, CA making residential building material deliveries around the greater Los Angeles area.

18m596i,Considering to quit PhD after 4years,"As the title says, I'm considering to quit my PhD after around 4 years and would be happy to hear your thoughts on my situation. And apologies in advance, I have written for hours on this post and it has already become quite long, even though I have tried to shorten it again. I hope it's still somewhat coherent. If anybody of you takes the time to read it, thank you very much, you are awesome! :)  


**TLDR:** I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University (i.e. I have already earned my Masters degree 4 years ago) with 2 more years until the final deadline. I have worked for 2-3 years on a project, which I abandoned 10months ago without proper results as it didn't work out. Afterwards, I have started a new project, but again find myself in a bad place and worried about my mental health. My supervisor has been and is completely unsupportive. Now, I'm torn between trying to push on and quitting. I am worried that in the first case I'll further ruin my mental health, in the second case I'm worried about regretting the decision later and experiencing it as failure possibly also making me unhappy.  


**Some basic information about me and my PhD program**  
I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University. As it is typical in Germany, I have already earned my Masters degree before the PhD. I am 29 years old. I have a position that, with around 48k, is an uncommonly well payed position. Funding is available for 2 more years. I am also accepted as a PhD student at the University for 2 more years, a significant extension beyond this is unlikely. In the first year I (and my supervisor) didn't have any idea for a research topic and at the same time I was TA for one of the big Mathematics lectures. Nevertheless, I gradually managed to work out a project and start working on it. For the following 2-2.5 years I have worked on this project. About 10 months ago I quit the previous project as it didn't work out and switched to a new project, which is only vaguely connected to the old one. Since then, I have no teaching obligations anymore.  


**The problems/reasons why I consider to quit**  
The problems basically fall into three categories.  
*i) Related to my well being/mental health:* This is the most important aspect for me. For most of the previous project I have felt continuously unhappy at work. The topic change has given me a motivation boost, but this has worn off again by now. Instead, I now find myself in a situation, where I am unable to even properly focus on my work anymore (even though it's actually not that complicated right now), have repeatedly sleep problems, frequently feel completely drained and/or sad after being at work and occasionally am even unable to motivate myself for activities outside of work. Fortunately, the issues mostly pass once I have a few days off from work, but still I have the fear that they might become persistent if I push through it even longer. Moreover, my self-confidence has completely vanished over the years in my PhD. Even though I try to not attach it to the progress in my PhD, my self-esteem has suffered significantly, too.  Finally, I don't feel like I have the energy to do all the things I still need to do if I want to finish my PhD.   
*ii) Related to my progress:* I have worked for between 2 and 3 years on the previous project. However, the only outcome of this project is a ""proof"" which relies on an assumption whose validity cannot be established by the current state of the research in the field and which we therefore never tried to publish. My supervisor has never given me a proper Yes or No whether he would be fine if I include it in my dissertation, even though I have asked/discussed it multiple times. In the new project, I have made some progress that, however, is only of interest for our industrial partner in the project, but does not involve any Mathematical progress and that I cannot include in my dissertation due to the NDA with the industrial partner. I have started working on some minor Mathematical contributions but are stuck, see also i). As a consequence, I have no results at all so far that I can include in my dissertation. Obviously, I have not submitted any papers or given any talks anywhere as a consequence.  
*iii) Related to my supervisor:* My supervisor has been and continues to be completely unsupportive. To be precise, he does not reply to mails, is absent most of the time, is unable to provide both strategical and mathematical advice and does not provide feedback even if explicitly asked to do so. So far it has especially been almost impossible to discuss the problems I had in my PhD so far with him. The perfect example for our relationship is the situation where I wanted to discuss the option of taking a break from my PhD for an internship outside of academia. As he was again absent for a while, I have sent him an email in which I roughly outlined the topic and asked for a meeting. He then ignored my email (and a follow-up one) for several weeks, and when I accidentally stumbled upon him at work, he told me, in (without exaggeration) just about 30 seconds, that he is against it and that he now has to attend a meeting. Afterwards, there haven't been any further discussion about it.  


**Why I have started and so far continued the PhD**  
Originally, I have started my PhD probably for some of the worst reasons possible. Up until my PhD, I have been a rather good student even finishing my Masters with the best possible grade. And, I'm not gonna lie, at that point I had based a lot of my self esteem on this fact/on seeing me as an intelligent person which is able to handle most intellectual challenges. In that sense, doing a PhD seemed as the next logical step to prove this view of myself to myself. Moreover, it was convenient as my supervisor offered me the position at the University I was already at with an uncommonly good salary of around 48000‚Ç¨. A former professor who just retired when I started my PhD and who was very renowned in the field that I am working now additionally promised me that he will help me to organize research stays at other interesting Universities. Of course, I was also somewhat excited about the research area, even though it now feels like I have never had a really deep interest in it.   
What then kept me in my PhD at all the multiple times where I thought about quitting, is that I really enjoy teaching and would like to increase my chances of doing University/College level teaching later on, that I can't help but see quitting as a failure of myself and an increasingly strong sunk cost fallacy. Recently, also the fear that quitting a PhD after such a long time might give possible future employees the impression that I am not a competent Mathematician, that I am not perseverant and that I am not able to make the right decision at the right time has added to that. 

**My options and how I look at them**

*i) Continue to push through my PhD for 2 more years:* If I find a way to focus again at work and possibly make progress on some of the topics I am stuck at, I could imagine that this scenario works out. However, I am seriously worried that nevertheless the mental health issues I am already encountering become even more severe and constant along the way and that the joy/pride of pushing through is not even remotely compensating this anymore.  
*ii) Apply for a new job:* If my current job was a ""normal"" job, i.e. not possibly rewarded with a PhD, I am almost certain that I would have changed jobs already. And I can imagine that I might be happier in another job (after a while). However, I can also very well imagine that the feeling of failure together with the thoughts about ""what if I had finished it"" might be so powerful that I also end up really unhappy in this scenario. And I have noticed that, whenever I seriously picture me leaving the PhD behind, I get a very strong and dreadful feeling of actually deserving a PhD and having being cheated out of the possibility that keeps me from accepting this scenario. Of course, I am well aware that this is a weird, bad and unjustified sense of entitlement - Mark Manson sens his regards. I think this comes from the fact that friends of mine that are probably not significantly better researchers are about to finish.

State of play
- Have submitted 4 of 6 substantive chapters (2x analytical chapters, methodology, and periodisation chapters) to supervisors. Only minor revisions suggested to each.
- Only probably 2-3k words left each in the last analytical chapter and theoretical framework chapters.
- Then have to write intro and conclusion.

1jr3dk9,Dropping out of college,"
26F, CS major. 

Basically I come from an immigrant family who expected far too much from me. I had no ‚Äúdream career‚Äù and no interest in doing anything. All these years I‚Äôve literally been bullshiting my way to this point, it somehow worked out through high school and through my first few years in community college but this is as far as I‚Äôm getting. It all came at the cost of my mental health. Looking back I never really had a healthy mental state but with college I can certainly say it‚Äôs brought it down to rock bottom. I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed but I‚Äôm fairly certainly I have undiagnosed ADHD, bipolar disorder or depression.  Everyday was a fight. It‚Äôs fucked me up so much. Ive taken so many gap years, gone through a few major changes and got dismissed twice already and I‚Äôm about to be dismissed for the third. 

Apparently appeals after the third dismissal are typically denied and that‚Äôs understandable. Though there is one last option I have which is a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù program that I believe all colleges offer(?) but I‚Äôd have to wait for 3 years to reapply (and it‚Äôs only a small selected number of students) but quite honestly I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll even want to by then. I legitimately believe I‚Äôve been traumatized, everything related to school just makes me miserable and scared. I can‚Äôt even look at a classroom without a chill running down my spine. And anyways, by that time I‚Äôll be nearing 30 and the thought of that alone makes me want to end it all. My whole life wasted on nothing. Straight up a failure. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. I feel pathetic, guilty, lost and i don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm stupid but I definitely FEEL stupid. Point is I don‚Äôt have much of a choice now than to drop out. I could try to appeal again but if, and that‚Äôs a big IF I got readmitted, honestly I still don‚Äôt have the motivation. I have around 13-15 more classes to take to graduate but I just don‚Äôt have it in me to thug it out and try to finish them anymore. It‚Äôd be a stupid waste of money and time. 
Thinking about dropping out sounds freeing though. Almost makes me feel happy. I don‚Äôt mind it. As corny as this might sound i feel like I‚Äôve been shackled my whole damn life and this is the one time I feel good about doing something but at the same time it‚Äôs terrifying. I keep having second thoughts‚Ä¶. Like what happens next ? What direction will I be going in life ? What options do i have ? Not to mention the biggest issue is that I can‚Äôt handle everyone‚Äôs disappointment. It‚Äôs too heavy for me.

1ldyr13,"I Don‚Äôt Want to Reward Students for Pestering, Just Me?","Student emails me at 9pm last night with a question (about an assignment students almost never have questions about because I‚Äôve been teaching it this way for years). 

Student sends a follow up at noon today (with the rationale that they feel overwhelmed if they don‚Äôt have all the details).

I now feel caught between two meh options.

So now I‚Äôm trying to figure out when I would have replied if the student had not sent this follow up. 

Anyone else get this? Anyone else tempted to sit on emails for a minute to help students learn reasonable expectations for response times and to develop some skills for handling their feelings around short delays? 

Edit update:
Thanks all! I replied. I also let the student know that per the syllabus, they shouldn‚Äôt follow up on emails for at least 2 business days‚Äî and that in their future job, they should allow a full 3-5 BDs. 

I heard some great suggestions‚Äî

1. Replying right away but scheduling the send for a more appropriate time. I love the idea. 

2. Having students wait until office hours to ask questions about assignments. Very interesting. I don‚Äôt hold routine office hours, so it wouldn‚Äôt work for me, but I can see it as a good way to teach students to plan ahead for those who do host regular office hours.

3. Having specific hours of the day when they reply to student emails. I like this one too. I might try this for future students with an early course announcement like: ‚ÄúI reply to student emails each day from 3-4 pm. Consider this our virtual, asynchronous office hour. Make sure to plan ahead and work on your assignments in advance so that you have enough time to ask any questions that may arise for you.‚Äù I like this. 

They really do need help adjusting to professional norms. Their future bosses will not thank us if we encourage them to expect immediate responses to requests.

1mpz6kq,"Advice for designing short ""video response"" assignments to be used with in-person classes?","I'm thinking of trying some form of video response/reflection assignments in a class this fall.  Have never attempted it before.  Here's some additional context and some tentative parameters I'm envisioning:

**Class Modality:**  in-person

**Discipline:**  a humanities field

**Class level:** introductory/gen-ed (mainly freshmen and sophomores)

**Class size:** \~25

**Assignment frequency:** weekly (or maybe bi-weekly would be better to avoid student and instructor burnout?)

**What students will be responding to:**  in-class discussions  
(which may include small group discussions, whole class discussions, or some combination)

**Timeframe:**  If a discussion takes place in class on a Monday, students would need to post their video response before the next class meeting on Wednesday

**Assignment Type and Weighting:** formative and fairly low-stakes; assignment category as a whole (for all video responses combined) would be about 10-15% of the total grade

**Assignment Objective:** students should demonstrate that they paid attention and have given some further thought to a few specific points from the discussion

Ex: making a connection from the day's discussion to other assigned materials or discussions from the course; raising further questions; connecting a point from discussion to some aspect of their personal or educational experience; etc..  I have a list of open-ended reflective questions I already ask them to use with assigned readings and other materials that I would modify it to apply for discussion-based reflection so they would have something to use as a guide.

**Time limit for each response:**  3 minutes (is that long enough/too long?)

Would love any advice (including any suggested modifications to my tentative parameters above) from those who have tried this type of assignment, whether the advice is based on a sucess story or a flaming fiasco!

1l1bw8e,Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting a PhD Abroad,"Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôm putting together a few insights that I wish I had known before starting my PhD abroad. Whether you're applying to programs in Europe, the US, or elsewhere, these might help someone out there navigating similar challenges:

1. **Understand the Funding Model Early:** Not all PhD programs abroad are fully funded. Some include stipends and tuition waivers, others don't. Always ask about what's covered especially living expenses.
2. **Know Your Rights as a PhD Student:** In some countries, PhD students are considered employees. In others, you‚Äôre more like a student. This impacts things like contracts, working hours, and supervision expectations.
3. **Build a Support Network from Day 1:** Isolation hits harder abroad. Try to join writing groups, attend workshops, or find accountability buddies online or locally. It makes a huge difference.
4. **Supervisor Fit Matters More Than Prestige:** A famous university won‚Äôt save you from a toxic supervisor. Choose someone who supports your research goals and communication style.
5. **Document Everything:** From emails with your supervisor to lab notes, keeping records can save you from confusion or disputes later.
6. **It's Okay to Take Time Off:** Burnout is real. Don‚Äôt fall into the ‚ÄúI have to work 80 hours a week‚Äù trap. Quality matters more than hours logged.

Fellow PhDs or applicants what‚Äôs something you wish you knew before you started your program abroad? Would love to hear your perspectives too.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1l1bw8e/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_starting_a_phd_abroad/
1n1mvl0,Advice on LORs and Electives to a 3rd yr (EM/IM),"I'll try to keep this direct and to the point bc I know we don't all have time for essays.

OMS-III, interested in EM or IM. Older, non-trad career changer. My main target for residency is to be back in a mid sized city - pre-clinicals were also in a rural town.

Current rotation site: community hospital, level 3 trauma center, no IM residency.

Research: None right now, but at least will have one by the end (school required).

EM: I'm trying to do my spring elective in EM at a different site bc I'd like some more exposure. My mandatory EM is 1st block 4th yr. Running into lots of roadblocks as a 3rd yr, with those slots going to 4th yrs (to be expected). My main knock against this specialty is the burnout tales and that others have said there are no ""old"" ED docs. I'm already old and don't plan to retire just as I'm starting. Also, there's no plan B for this specialty (no OP work that I know of other than admin which I don't want to do).

IM + LORs: Pro for IM is more subspecialty options and IP/OP options for most specialties. However, residency quality will matter when it comes to matching fellowships.

My main concern is I won't have an IM PD letter (no home program). Our site dean is pretty involved and usually writes LORs (assuming we don't do something stupid) but he's not IM. I didn't ask for a LOR from my very first rotation with a outpatient PCP (IM trained) bc I was getting my bearings and only spent a week with him. I'm considering spending a 4th yr elective with him because he's sharp as a tack and could write me a good letter (he gave a good eval but comments were generic). Problem is I only have 1 elective slot in 4th year before ERAS apps need to be submitted so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to ""get it right"". Should I spend that 4th yr instead at another hospital in IM?

w94k76,Why don't more CS students take reduced course loads instead of burning out and dropping out of CS?," It seems that one of the biggest reasons students in CS suffer from burn-out and drop out is because of the heavy course-load of 5 or so classes per semester. Doesn't it make more sense to just reduce your course load so that you can potentially avoid burn out which probably leads to dropping out? It seems people have this ""all or nothing - do or die mindset"". I never understood this because I have friends who never even attempted part time course loads, they just went from full time to dropping out completely. Why?

EDIT: Did not realize the financial cost of school in the US. It‚Äôs like 8-10K here in Canada. It also seems like your scholarships, etc only cover 4 years. So makes sense for a lot of you to force it in 4 years",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w94k76/why_dont_more_cs_students_take_reduced_course/

1loxtzz,Thinking of leaving my Oxford PhD ‚Äî how do I know I‚Äôve really tried?,"Hi all ‚Äî I‚Äôm 28 and currently doing a PhD at Oxford, UK, in Engineeing. I applied mostly because it was Oxford and in a field related to my previous job ‚Äî I always wanted to do a PhD and thought it would give me structure, credibility, maybe even pride. But nearly two years in, I‚Äôm starting to question whether I‚Äôve truly given this a fair shot, or whether it‚Äôs just not right for me.

I completed my first-year modules, but then intermitted for 9 months due to burnout and several family bereavements. During that time, I was also diagnosed as autistic and with ADHD ‚Äî which explained a lot about why I‚Äôd been struggling to stay afloat, masking constantly, and running on fumes.

When I came back, things initially felt better. I had some strategies, more clarity, and genuine motivation. But over the last few months, I‚Äôve felt myself slipping again ‚Äî back into procrastination, disconnection, and exhaustion. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gained any skills or momentum. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve just‚Ä¶ existed through this, rather than grown.

I‚Äôm funded via a standard stipend, but was supposed to receive an uplift from my external sponsor. Despite chasing it over and over, it‚Äôs never come through ‚Äî and after two years, that uncertainty has really worn me down. The admin and comms have been messy and demoralising.

I haven‚Äôt made friends here. I‚Äôm not sure how well I tried, and I still feel isolated. Most days I work alone, or avoid working altogether because I‚Äôm too overwhelmed. And to be honest, I don‚Äôt even know if I care about my research topic anymore ‚Äî but I also don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs burnout talking, or if I just chose a project for the institution, not the subject.

I keep asking myself: have I tried hard enough to know this isn‚Äôt right for me? Or am I quitting something I haven‚Äôt really let myself engage with?
I‚Äôm scared that leaving would be a mistake ‚Äî but I‚Äôm also scared that staying would be one too. I don‚Äôt want to spend years trying to force myself into an environment I‚Äôm not built for.

134oo6k,Are mornings really that hard?,"This is partly a vent but I also very much want to know what others' experiences are.

I taught two sections of the same class this past semester.  One met at 9:30, the other met at 3:30.  I used the exact same slides, same material, same activities; everything was identical.  I use a flipped classroom so everything revolves around active learning and is super hands-on.  

The 9:30 class was like talking to zombies.  They were reluctant to speak, struggled to follow, and almost every single student was tangibly exhausted during every class.  Many routinely arrived late as well.

The 3:30 section was the complete opposite - every student was sharp, engaged, talkative, and very quick with the material.  They even seemed happy to be there - they genuinely seemed to enjoy the experience.

I've never experienced anything like this before.  I've seen different classroom ""cultures"" emerge based on the personalities of the students, etc., but this seemed different.  My best guess is that the time of day made the difference.

1h4zjle,Am I really cut out for a PhD?,"
Hey!

I‚Äôm a new PhD student in ECE. It‚Äôs been two months since I started, and honestly, I feel completely out of my depth. I can‚Äôt shake this overwhelming sense of inadequacy, like I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. It‚Äôs exhausting and makes me feel stupid, like I‚Äôm bound to fail, quit halfway, and let everyone down, including myself.

These feelings didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. They‚Äôve been haunting me since my undergrad days. I was a C student, rarely ever got A‚Äôs. My academic advisor even suggested I quit my major because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt cut out for it.‚Äù I seriously considered it but somehow managed to scrape through to graduation. My CGPA was the lowest in my batch, and when I graduated, I still had no idea what I had learned. My degree feels like a source of shame, something I‚Äôd bury and forget about if I could.

When I go to my department and see the students and lecturers, I feel like a stranger, like I don‚Äôt belong there. It feels like a place for geniuses, not for someone dumb like me.

When I got into my Master‚Äôs program, I swore I‚Äôd turn things around. It was coursework based, no research involved (just a project paper in the final semester), and there wasn‚Äôt even a viva voce to stress over. To my surprise, it went really well. I aced my courses, earning 99% A‚Äôs, and my supervisor was incredibly kind. She encouraged me to turn my project paper into a thesis, helped me present at conferences, and even co-authored two papers with me. I finished with no corrections on my paper, which felt surreal.

But even with all that, I couldn‚Äôt shake the imposter syndrome. It all felt like a fluke, like sheer dumb luck, not my effort or abilities. Deep down, I still see myself as the same pathetic, clueless C student I was in undergrad.

Now I‚Äôm here in a PhD program, where the stakes are higher, the journey tougher, and there‚Äôs no smooth path or lucky breaks to rely on. Part of me is excited by the challenge, but the doubt weighs so heavily. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll give up when it gets too hard, and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint myself again. I don‚Äôt want to choose comfort over a long-term challenge that could change my life.

I fear the comprehensive examination next year. I‚Äôm terrified I won‚Äôt pass it. But even before that, I‚Äôm struggling with the literature review. Reading papers feels like an impossible task. I procrastinate because I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt understand them. And when I do read, I often get stuck on certain information, unable to make sense of it, which leaves me frustrated and feeling even more inadequate. Literature review feels like hell.

I want to break out of this mindset and become someone I can be proud of, someone who can look back in a few years and say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I did it.‚Äù I want to feel like I belong in this journey.

Will I succeed? Will I ever truly feel like I‚Äôm fit to be a PhD student?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1h4zjle/am_i_really_cut_out_for_a_phd/

I know he's been depressed, but I'm not sure how to help when he won't talk to me and has refused to see a psychiatrist or a therapist. This is the same dude that didn't talk to me the 2 weeks leading up to both Step 1 and Step 2 (I asked for support and he said that I'm always stressed so it wasn't his problem). Same one that will say I don't make time for him, but when I ask to hang out he's usually been busy. Same one that I've been quick to forgive and tried to be there for since I know that sharing a life with a medical student is difficult. Same guy that was at one time my very best friend.

I know I've asked a lot of him with med school dictating my (and therefore his) life. I wonder how things may have been different if I wasn't in medicine. This makes the decisions I make for residency seem all the more important so this doesn't happen again.

q8qbqg,I Got 7 New Grad Offers: The Sequel (and tips that worked for me!),"Hello again r/csMajors! Some of you may remember me from my [incorrectly titled post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jgt7ce/i_got_7_internship_offers_a_long_summary_of_my/) where I received ""7"" (eventually 9) internship offers. After that whirlwind of a recruiting season, I was expecting to have a more laid-back time this year, especially with a return offer from my internship under my belt.

I submitted 41 applications (most of them as a joke) vs my 120+ from last year, sat back, and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of responses I got, so I decided to make another Reddit post.

**About Me:**

* Senior @ large state school (can tell which one by my post history, again)
* Double majoring in CS & Business Analytics
* 3.3 GPA (higher than last year thanks to open notes exams...)
* Two internships, a part time tech support job, 2 leadership positions (VP of one club, director of another) at school, 2 projects
* US Citizen

I tried to do a Sankey, but that quickly got confusing because this time around, a few of my interview processes were through the CodePath career fair & my prior recruiting contacts (I attended Grace Hopper but it only barely helped this time around, mostly because I was being selective with the number of interviews I was doing). So here's some quick facts instead.

**Quick Stats From This Year:**

* **Applications Submitted: 41**
* **Offers Received: 7 (JPMorgan return offer, IBM, VMWare, Asana, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, NBCUniversal)**
* **# of Resume Rejects: only one** (thanks Duolingo)
* **# of Total Rejections: 15** (mostly after OAs & interviews)
* **Interviews Done: 20** (including first rounds & finals)

**Notable Moments:**

* **Rejected from Hubspot after final** because it was my first ever System Design interview and I hadn't studied, oops...
* **Rejected from Microsoft after final** because one of my interviewers insisted my answer was wrong... when it was right... and the code ran with the correct output... whatever. No hard feelings!
* **Visa did 4 technical interviews, and then asked for a FIFTH one** so I finally turned them down.
* **Rejected from Facebook after first phone** because it was my first interview of the season and I hadn't interviewed anywhere in a year.
* **During my VMWare final interviews, one round was entirely systems/OS/networking questions. I'd never taken a systems class in my entire college career.** Even though I answered ""I don't know"" to every question, and had to explain why I didn't take Systems/OS to the interviewer, I still got the offer somehow?
* **Got sent the Google snapshot. I didn't do it. Recruiter reached out to me asking me to do it. I ghosted the recruiter.** I was absolutely exhausted after interviewing so much & Google's process is known to take FOREVER. Freshman me would probably slap current me if she knew though.
* **Asana's final round was the longest I'd ever done, at 5 hours & 15 minutes, and because of time zones it ended at 9 PM my time** but it was also the most enjoyable interview process I've ever done, even when it was so long & ended relatively late.

If anyone's interested I can add a list of every single company I interviewed with this fall in an edit, but since I only applied to 40 places the list would be kind of short. I also don't want to ramble on like I did in my post last year!

**Tips for recruiting?**

* For full time (or even 2nd/3rd internships), **""warm"" email any recruiters you talked to in the past.** Especially if you got far in their process last time, they'll probably be willing to take a chance on you again (make sure to re-introduce yourself if it's been a while). With Facebook I failed the first phone for their internship last year, but I emailed my recruiter this year and his response was ""I was meaning to reach out to you again, just apply and I'll send you the first phone scheduling right after"" so you literally never know.
* **Programs like CodePath and Facebook's ABCS really helped me.** Why? Because I study better with concrete goals/homework and other people, in a class-like setting. Facebook's ABCS is very well suited for sophomores & juniors seeking internships. CodePath's advanced technical interview prep class is suited towards full time since they cover a bit of system design. CodePath is especially great because their homework is directly assigned from Leetcode, and if you don't do it you get kicked from the program. Finish it all, and you get access to their invite-only career fair with 50+ companies. Pretty good incentive to Leetcode if you ask me.
* **Get your application in front of human eyes as quickly as possible.** Even if its not your actual application, visit the company at a career fair or something, and if you get the chance to talk with a recruiter, tell them you applied and are interested in their opportunities -- they're more likely to go and check at your application after. This is how I got ""un-ghosted"" -- talking to recruiters at GHC and the CodePath career fair.
* **SOFT SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT.** If you know how to solve a problem but can't explain your reasoning clearly to the interviewer, they WILL be confused. I think that's what cost me the Microsoft interview this year -- see above, I probably didn't explain my correct solution well enough. On the other hand, though, I can't count how many times I was absolutely clueless during an interview, but my communication & honesty saved me -- see VMWare above.
* **If you're job searching for the first time, get your resume reviewed & PUT IT THROUGH A PARSER.** Human feedback is definitely the first step, but after you quantify your descriptions and find a good layout, put your resume through a site like [jobscan.co](https://jobscan.co), VMock (offered by some schools' career centers), or even the few student-made parsers I've seen on this subreddit to see if it accurately determines your major/experience etc from your resume.
* **Studying for System Design? Use the** [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)**.** I didn't pay for Grokking, the primer had everything I needed to pass Asana's system design portion. If only I'd studied it for Hubspot...
* **Remember, you only need one offer.** It was definitely discouraging to me as an underclassman when I saw people picking between every FAANG and Citadel, but remember if you're starting out, all you need is that first company to give you a chance. Having choices is great (and sometimes scary) but even a single offer & nothing else can open a LOT of doors moving forward, so once you get that first offer letter, pat yourself on the back! You made it through a bunch of filtering to get there, and now the only direction you can go is even higher :)

If you've made it this far, you may be wondering **which offer I accepted** \-- I'm not gonna take up any more space on this post, so **check out my flair on this subreddit for your answer ;)**

Besides that, if anyone has questions about anything related to internship or full time recruiting/handling offers/my experiences/etc, **feel free to ask in the comments and I'll be answering as many as I can!** Since I've gotten 17 offers total in my time at college, I've pretty much done it all at this point so I want to give back and help all of you out too :D thanks for reading!

\--

Brief Edit: After signing my offer this morning I accidentally walked straight into a trash can on the way to class; the comments about trash cans are all my friends hahah

1e7jsa6,My former grad advisor is a reminder of why I decided not to pursue science.,"Half way through my PhD I took a leave of absence. My graduate advisor, an attractive white woman, was incessantly on my case about how many hours I was in lab. It didn‚Äôt matter that I had two first author papers and my name on other publications, she wanted my ass in the seat for 12 hours a day. She was terrible to women and minorities in her lab and constantly asked us to toe the ethical line to make our data pretty. She ‚Äòunintentionally‚Äô spread rumors that I had a drug addiction even though I tried endlessly to communicate I was burned out, which was unacceptable to her. The final straw was her inability to pursue the next step in my project, beyond the low hanging fruit. 

During my leave I decided I was going to quit but I needed a job. I began working in another lab while I figured things out. This professor was unlike anything I had experienced. Always engaged with the null hypothesis, never removed the outlying data because the natural world is fucking messy and not a pretty graph and, as a white man, was the most inclusive and caring boss I have ever had. I ended up finishing my PhD in his lab and my proudest career moments are the work and publications I did with him. His research was solid, flawless yet still humble. He has continued to struggle to get funding because his research suggests an entire field has gotten it wrong.

Meanwhile, my former advisor has received accolade after accolade, grant after grant while regularly flirting with the old white grant gate keepers, at least during my time in her lab. I just found out she got a fellowship for aiding women and minorities in science. 

I still struggle with leaving but times like these make me realize I can‚Äôt be successful and happy in a world I ethically reject.

Edit: I forgot the best part. One of her senior grad students verbally (almost physically) assaulted me in her lab because of my ethnicity. She did everything she could to get me to not file a complaint because he had such a promising future and he wasn‚Äôt really racist, just really stressed out over graduating.

i just graduated from a big 10 school like a week and a half ago with no job offer and no internship experience. i've been applying to like 5 jobs a day and a recruiter reached out to me on linkedin for a contract for a big shipping company that seemed like a sure thing until i took the hackerrank which i bombed spectacularly.

i'm 26, it took me 8 years to get through undergrad. i failed out of mechanical engineering and the university twice because of struggles with bipolar disorder, BPD, ADHD, and addiction. because of that my overall gpa is poo and i didn't make a ton of friends or connections in CS and my last chance to do so got rona'd. my cs education has been so spotty and spread out over the years that i just feel like i don't know how to program.

my last semester i stayed clean the whole time and ended up getting a 3.5 gpa in like the hardest classes i've ever taken, but that gave me zero time to grind leetcode or read the crack book. i look at all these 20yr olds that have internships at FAANG companies and feel like i can't compete at all.

1m96b58,Hit the wall at work,"A cry for help and advise.

I am a university professor from Russia . After I graduated with honors from my undergraduate program,  i immediately started working full-time as a lecturer, while simultaneously persuing my master's and actively engaging in  top-tier research.


I used to be able to teach five classes in a row from 9 am to 6pm , without a break for food or even the bathroom, then go to my own evening courses until 9 pm, come home, eat, and start doing homework... and, honestly, I felt... fine...

But now I feel like I‚Äôve hit a wall... In 2023, during my third year of teaching, after a series of unpleasant events, I fell into a completely miserable state: I kept working on two major research projects, teaching a huge number of courses‚Äîbasically plugging every hole I could‚Äîand studying in a PhD program. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt sleep for 48 hours straight and just work-work-work. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt even have the energy to shower (yes, I didn‚Äôt care that I stinked), I became easily irritable, flinching at every noise, and more... In December the whole month I worked with a 39¬∞C fever because I was afraid of letting the students down‚Äîafter all I get at least some kind of life energy  when I‚Äôm with them, and I feel like my life has some kind of meaning (since, no matter how hard I worked, I was constantly being told by my higher-up that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough‚Äîsomething I later realized was partly because I didn‚Äôt complain and never told them I was pulling all-nighters to meet their deadlines‚Äîbut that‚Äôs a whole other story). And I think that was the final strow that broke my back: even though most of my teaching load ended by the end of 2023, and I finally had some time to take care of myself, I still felt like I was drowning in some kind of deep swamp... it was incredibly disheartening.

The summer of 2024 I spent basically without a vacation, dealing with some family issues and wrapping up research projects (I didn't visit my hometown even once during summerto see my parents‚Äîthere just wasn‚Äôt time). And now, in 2025, my entire legally allotted vacation, my whole summer, is being eaten up by writing this pointless brick of a dissertation.

Why is it taking me so long to write? Because No matter how hard I try, it feels like I‚Äôm slogging through some very dark wasteland‚ÄîIam writing actively, using up energy I have left into it, but it takes me three times longer than it should... which means no rest this year either.

 I even considered taking academic leave‚Äîif only this weren‚Äôt the very final stretch of my PhD.
As is often the case with teachers, I‚Äôm constantly sick, constantly tired, and my mood swings wildly. Overall, I don't feel bad ALl the time  yet I feel like all the joy I experience now does not compare at all to 2021‚Äì2022, because everything I feel is like... in a fog.

I‚Äôve heard that in Europe, one can  take a  temporary disability  due to depression... unfortunately, that is not possible in my country, 'cause people with mental illness record are prohibited from teaching. Which is why I have no idea what I can do in this situation, because I don‚Äôt want the repeat of 2023, when I lived in constant paranoia that I was being watched, with a clogged toilet full of shit I kept going to and defecating until it over-poured anyways because I literally did not have the capacity to get up and fix it‚Äîbut I still kept showing up to classes and trying to smile... 

The upcoming academic year looks like it won‚Äôt be that difficult: I will not have any big research projects, no more PhD obligations after defending in the fall. And when I am writing it, I even feel like I can wait one more like this and take it thru,  But I don't know

I am honestly, jealous of my classmates‚Äîthose who could afford not to work from their third year of undergrad onwards let alone those whose parents allowed them to take time off between life stages to recover. I am jealous of western people who don't have five years of teaching experience by 26 and are not expected to yield q1  articles by then.

Right now, it feels like this career has eaten away several years of my life for nothing and just led me into a deep, empty nowhere, but there is no alternative rout I can take. 

I don't know. Have anyone been in this situation? How can i escape this?

1munuq6,How to stop dreading and avoiding writing papers/proposals,"I've always considered myself a strong writer and have been told I'm a good writer. But now as a grad student, it is the #1 type of task that I try to avoid subconsciously. I find myself dreading it so much and making it up to be such a huge ordeal in my head.

Especially around my niche topic of interest that I've been working on for years. Maybe it's something about that- writing and rewriting about the same things over and over... It should make it easier in a way, but there's this feeling like it's never quite perfect and also not really improving much, and getting tired of hearing myself talk about it. Using the same arguments more than once makes me question myself more and more, and wonder if it was good enough to say twice or ten times.

I also just worry that I won't be able to get all my thoughts out clearly or they won't come together right. I feel overwhelmed by how many different ways there are to communicate things -- The many that I think of and go back and forth on, plus all the others I haven't thought of. I always feel like I'm forgetting something and it's never quite satisfying to me. There's always something to improve and I'm always juggling different advice I've heard and followed over the years... my brain is like: ""be extremely clear and straightforward... but wait, don't be redundant, and just show don't tell"" ""be very easy to understand and use plain language... but wait, don't be boring and formulaic"" ""use precise vocabulary.. but wait, make it accessible to the general public too"" ""be thorough... but wait, no one cares about these details and you're losing people""

1kor56c,Totally lost on how (and if) I should be switching from academia to industry,"Hi all,

I am a young-ish postdoc (30-ish) in automation/ control engineering/applied mathematics from a developed country, and I am currently at a point in life where I am struggling to justify the current state of academia.

I feel really overwhelmed by the fact that what seems to matter most is the sheer number of papers one has to publish just to have a shot. This has led me to the realization that I am on the slower side. I need to fully understand any area of the macro-subject I am working with before I can feel comfortable, namely, I have to be able to derive all the tools I am using from a basic set of assumptions.

Furthermore, during my employment, I was never offered the opportunity to tutor students or collaborate with other Ph.D.s. As a result, the menial tasks such as running simulations were always mine to handle, along with writing the main body of the text and the proofs, doing the literature review, and fixing any issues that came up to some degree. Now, in between jobs, with my next one starting in two months, this has finally changed. I have been able to foster some connections. However, it already feels too late to have any decent shot at an academic future.

This situation was not helped by the fact that I suffered from a serious illness last year, which still affects me to some extent, and that the COVID period during my Ph.D. was quite harsh on me. Still, I take full responsibility for not being fast enough.

To make matters worse, while applying for academic jobs, I keep getting replies from professors asking whether I would be willing to play the grant lottery with them without any pay. This only amplifies the bad feelings I have toward the system, which does not help on the motivation front. I do enjoy doing research and tackling real problems, but I can no longer tolerate the many superficial behaviors I see in some of my peers.

So, this year, I decided to seriously try to transition to industry while still maintaining some ties to academia. I know industry is not perfect, but I feel it would open up more options for me once I get in. The pay would likely be better as well, and I would be free from these never-ending one-year contracts with an optional second renewal.

However, it has now been six months and I have not even landed an interview. And this is breaking me.

So I would really appreciate some advice from people with real experience. I would like to ask:
i) How can I better present or sell myself on the job market? (Type of resume? Word over pdf? ...) ii) Am I just being a sour loser, which is how I feel, and will I regret walking away from academia later? Or should I keep pushing forward and postpone the decision a bit longer?

I would really love to hear some honest advice from people who have been through it.

Edit: I used ChatGPT to double-check if there were any mistakes in the text and copied the prompt, too.

I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how ‚Äúgracious‚Äù he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won‚Äôt be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless.

123ppzd,The constant cringefest that is grad school,"In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work/internship/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.

In grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, ""There are much better uses of my time than this,"" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.

I've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing.

1knoqkq,Brain stopped working during class,"Hi all, requesting any stories you can share to make me feel better about the embarrassment I suffered in my class today!

  
Some context: I am going through some pretty extreme stress with a sick/elderly parent, a trial I have to testify for approaching, some issues that happened with a specific student and caused some administrative drama, on top of an already busy and demanding schedule. Today I also had a specialty health appointment that I had been waiting 6 months for and ended in disappointing / upsetting news. I teach 2 classes for adult learners on Thursdays, both online, once in the afternoon and once in the evening.

  
By my evening class, I was exhausted but working through it, teaching material that I know very well and have been over many times. But then suddenly I noticed myself becoming less and less coherent and then my brain seemed to freeze for a full minute. This was an online class and I *stopped talking for a full minute*. I could see the students looking confused / worried which increased my panic. Eventually I composed myself, apologized and went on. I seemed to get a second wind after that and the rest of the class went on fine aside from the fact that I was embarrassed and apologized / made excuses several more times before class was up.

  
This is probably the third time I have been super exhausted during this class and it's beyond embarrassing to make the excuse of, ""I'm sorry class, I'm so tired"" for a *scheduled* evening class. I feel like the students are seeing the worst of me and I don't want them to leave with the impression that I am a bad teacher, unprofessional, etc. If I was a student seeing this class, I would have thought ""wow this person is drunk or there is something wrong with them"".

My first postdoc was tough, and not nearly as productive as I would have imagined or liked, but I learnt a lot from it, and am now seeing some of the work I've done be published (~6 months after finishing). My mental health suffered quite a lot during my second year there, mostly due to some issues with my boss, and the relationship we had, which started off very nice, really deteriorated towards the end of it. Alas, I finished, and got out..

.. into another postdoc. I was pretty happy to secure this job, as when I interviewed for it, I hadn't published anything new since finishing my PhD. Nevertheless, recommendations (from my PhD supervisor, not my postdoc supervisor) were sufficient to get me the job. I'm in a slightly different, albeit similar, field. The working conditions here are much nicer (so far), but I have so little direction (and I fear that I'm starting to lose motivation too) and have had no successes in the first 3 months of being here, which doesn't feel too abnormal, but all of the projects I'm working on feel like absolute pipe dreams, and this stresses me out. I'm starting to question if I'm creative or innovative enough to continue in an academic career, and if that's the case, then why am I even bothering with a postdoc?

1hxmbr8,starting the semester strong & recovering from post-burnout bad habits [US],"Hello all! The **TL;DR** is basically in the title, but the slight expansion is: I have been *very* burnt out for quite awhile, and have become very used to procrastinating and using various vices (mostly excessive reading) as escapism. As I am moving forward into this new semester, I'm feeling hopeful and mostly prepared, but my burnout-vices have become extremely habitual, and I'm struggling to create new, constructive habits. How do I reengage myself as a grad student? I appreciate any and all tips--even if it's not helpful to me, it might be to someone else.

\---

Okay now the longer version if you want more context:

I'm technically a second-year PhD student in astro, though I largely consider myself a first-year as I am mostly completing first-year courses. Things have been difficult from the get-go. I've struggled to keep up with work, struggled to care about my classes, struggled to care about my research. I got extremely burnt out at the end of undergrad, and would have taken a year off if I had not won the NSF (which you can't defer).

To be honest, I was doing quite well with getting caught up, then this past semester just had one thing after another go wrong and had to take an Incomplete in yet another class and I barely completed *last* years' Incompletes. I used to be very on top of things, and though I am trying not to romanticize my undergrad self (who was very studious but also very lonely) it's hard not to. I don't really trust myself anymore when I say I am going to do something, though I am starting to do this more and more often.

I considered dropping out for awhile, but realized eventually it was burnout/depression-induced apathy. After a lot of soul-searching (and therapy) I discovered I *do* actually want to complete this degree, but I've gotten *really* used to procrastinating. That's the big issue: Regardless of actual motivation and dedication, I am used to quick dopamine hits. My ""vice"" of choice is reading fiction, which probably doesn't sound like such a bad thing but it takes hours out of every day. I'm not trying to stop reading, but I would like to get a handle on how much control it has over my life. **In general, I really want to start this new semester strong, and carry that through. I want to prove to myself that I** ***am*** **capable of getting my PhD.**

I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people‚Äôs resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that‚Äôs a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that‚Äôs something worth sharing or if maybe I‚Äôm just not ready yet to be applying to internships.

Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I‚Äôve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they‚Äôre not very relevant to cs so I don‚Äôt wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it‚Äôs worth adding? Lmk guys.

Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help üôÅ.

Ok thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1n5cft8/questions_from_a_cooked_sophomore/
i40akg,[Vent] A doctor in Beirut,"I would like to share briefly my experience as a young doctor during the aftermath of the explosion that devastated beirut yesterday.


To summarize briefly it was a warzone.


The hospitals were over crowded, was running from patient to patient, suturing in dirty condition even though I tried my best to keep it sterile. We were over exhausted but during all this bleak situation I saw doctors, nurses, surgeon all coming from various places all around lebanon just to help. They were just here helping the other. Those who couldn‚Äôt help us provided us with some food and water. It was a heartwarming scene during this crisis.


Thank you for listening to me. I needed to get this out.

Edit: Thanks all for the amazing response. If you want to help, donate to Lebanese NGO like the Lebanese [Red Cross ](https://supportlrc.app/donate/) or to [Impact Lebanon](http://help-lebanon.me/).

1k2e5kd,I am the worst student ever and I really just want to cry,"I started in September as a pre doc. I never really wanted to work in academia. It just sort of happened because my previous career attempts didn't work out and I was unemployed and this institute somehow decided my CV was good enough to work with them. It's sort of related to what I used to do anyway and it is a great institute with a great name. I struggle with mental health and I thought this could be my chance to a fresh start. I moved countries to be here and I hoped for the best.

But I am not good enough.

My supervisor is a star of his field. He publishes all the time, works like a horse, knows everyone. He has a great eye for detail and misses NOTHING. He is always ready to give on point advice and is extremely involved in his students' activities.

I am the opposite. I am slow and sloppy and can't get things done. I do my best or what I think it's my best but it's just not at the level needed. Sometimes I have very short bursts when I think I maybe have it figured out and I am on the right track but then reality quickly shows up at the door in the form of my supervisor being disappointed with me.

We have this project where I have to manually transcribe data from 150+ locations. There is no way to make it automatic, the data are just too chaotic and sparse. The way it works is that we filter out the locations where the results from the data analysis are above a certain threshold. So the data transcription and analysis is crucial for everything that comes afterwards. My supervisor had asked for an extra hand because it's a lot of work and so I volunteered - it was very relevant to my own research anyway. But I wish I never did.

Essentially I lost track of the data analysis at some point and made a mess. Twice. I was lucky that the mess didn't end up affecting anyone's work, in the sense that it could be fixed easily without compromising the entirety of the paper (which will be submitted in two weeks and is a team effort). But my supervisor was very clearly angry and impatient at me for being so sloppy AGAIN. He is the kind of person that never gets impatient with anyone so that was really hard to witness.

And then there are other things. I am leading a scoping review with 8k studies. After screening them all on Covidence, I realized that the papers that had passed the screening were not what I was expecting whilst the ones that I meant to talk about didn't show up at all and my search terms were pointless. So essentially the whole review was worthless. I had to reshuffle and reorganise the terms completely and my supervisor had to send an email to Covidence asking them to reset our review so that we could start from scratch as we only have one paid license. Our initial goal was to publish in early May.

On top of that I have to take classes, which I imagine is normal for a pre doc, and I wonder how people manage because I most certainly do not.

I am writing a paper and the review and the project are tangentially related but I have neither the time nor the energy to properly research references and put things together coherently. Whenever I submit written material to my supervisor he basically re writes 90% of it.

I haven't published anything yet. I have been here since September and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. 

Doesn't help that my supervisor is from another continent and I often feel we just communicate on two fundamentally different levels. I feel I am constantly failing him. I am grateful to be here and I am grateful that he's my supervisor but I don't think he knows. I think he believes I'm shit.

I am sure lots of conversations about me and my performance are happening behind closed doors. I am ""that student"". I have already noticed subtle hints. Like the way my boss increased the frequency of our meetings and at the same time how he reduced the number and difficulty of my tasks, the way he went from being relatively friendly to somewhat annoyed etc. And oh my God do I feel embarrassed about it. I am so self conscious and aware of it and yet I can't seem to change.

I tried to be a good student and colleague, humble, proactive, diligent, but it always ends up with me getting overwhelmed and making a mess.

1iajksd,"Fired for being ""too stressed."" At a loss right now.","Hey reddit,
Dealing with a lot right now. 
Tl;dr: my advisor decided I get too stressed about setbacks and picked up that I wasn't happy in general (she says) and decided to fire me about it. At a loss for how to process this, generally struggling with next steps.

Long version:
I'm a PhD candidate in biosci at a US ""top 20"" school. I joined with a strong interest in synthetic biology, and ended up in an engineering department with an advisor who was in the act of ""branching out"" into synthetic biology. I picked up a project that had been passed down through two postdocs and had relatively little in common with the rest of the lab research (some vague abstractions tied it to other work, but very few technical bridges). The second postdoc was there for my rotation, but his contract ended in the first month of it being my (supposed) thesis lab.

I experienced a gradual decline in being happy with my lab. It is not a lab that values mentorship at all, which is a deep struggle we all share. As I progressed in understanding my research area, I slowly came to realize that much (not all) of the work done by the postdocs was not working, but specifically not working in ways that should have been anticipated from knowing the literature. The root of the problem was an advisor who did not understand synthetic biology or the area of work in general. I repeatedly had to remind her or teach her fundamental knowledge of the field, and eventually I quit going to her for advice outright. She is the most ""hands-off"" advisor I have encountered, meaning she doesn't ask for updates or seem to really give a shit about what it is I'm doing (unless it gives her a publication).

Much of my first year was spent trying to replicate some data that I built much of my thesis proposal on. She repeatedly pressured me to publish the postdoc's data with arbitrary deadlines until I outright refused due to it not replicating. I dug up raw data earlier this month and found out they ran 5 assays, and showed only the one where it ""worked."" The other 4 looked identical to my data. 

My stress hit a boiling point one month before my qualifying exam, when I had done about 3-4 months of troubleshooting a method, then I found out it was impossible with the materials I had due to a mutation in our lab strain. I suspected this a year ago and asked everyone involved, but dropped the matter because our strain had been sequenced, analyzed, and published as a supplemental figure. That sequencing analysis was simply flat WRONG, and the person who did it had told me before: ""She (ex advisor) will push you to publish, even if it's not ready, even if it's bullshit."" This left me with functionally no progress on my first aim, 1 month from my qual.

I tried to address the issue with ex-advisor, but after getting an ""ok,"" and an ""I don't know,"" I lost my head a little. I apologized for this later, but there was never a discussion about how I was effected, or how the wrong analysis was published, and I was told NOT to talk about it during my qual. She said that there will be a correction, but every attempt I made to follow up was shut down with indifference or hostility.

I passed my qual in November and got on with life. Early this January, we had a meeting with the Ombuds where she said I don't seem happy. I agreed and said I need more hands-on mentorship. She said that if I was going to seek that, I already would have (at the time I was actively pursuing an internship and an external collaboration). She decided that because I was getting so stressed, that a PhD is not worth the emotional toll for me and I shouldn't do a PhD anywhere. She basically then gaslit me into leaving the lab by telling me I should find a new advisor and not answering if I was being kicked out of the lab. 

I don't know if that correction letter will ever happen, and I'm considering going to the provost. 

Anyway, I hated that bitch, so I'm out of the frying pan. But now I'm desperately looking for new labs and opportunities and stressed out of my mind (into the fire). I did truly believe in my project, even though that lab was not supporting it, so it may be time to grieve that. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. 

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read this far.

1cxsg5a,Do it already: get stricter with your attendance and late work policies,"I know institutional/school/departmental policies and support vary among us, but if you can get stricter with your attendance and late work policies, I encourage you to do so next semester. After lots of hand wringing over wanting to bring more structure into my classes since loosening my attendance and late work policies since covid, I finally went ahead with it this spring. I expected lots of complaints and groveling for special exceptions, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn‚Äôt the case.

I had no complaints (at least none to my face; evals forthcoming), and only a handful of students asked for exceptions (a few deserving and I was happy to make the requested accommodations). One student, after realizing that I was going to enforce my policies, told me that he ""locked in"" and will now pass the class with an A. Several students told me that these policies actually helped them stay on top of the coursework and motivated them to come to class, and they could see a direct correlation between doing those things and performing well. On my end, I can attest that what they are feeling is actually true as I see higher class averages in all of my courses. So even if they do complain in the evals, I‚Äôll point to the success rates as my rebuttal.

Another benefit is that I am no longer haunted: getting stricter has drastically cut down on the amount of ghosts emailing me on the last days of the semester asking ‚Äúif there‚Äôs a way‚Äù to still pass the class, offering to turn in months worth of missing assignments to add to the pile of finals that I‚Äôm grading.

And I‚Äôve had fewer cases of that new breed of student, the one who regularly attends and actively participates in class but never turns anything in, possibly because you‚Äôve coddled them and assured them that you will accept any and all of their work up until‚Äìand maybe even beyond!--the end of the semester. You appreciate their participation in class so you do them this favor of giving them extended deadlines, but you aren‚Äôt helping them! You‚Äôre actually adding to their mental anguish as the end of the term arrives and they are overwhelmed and psychologically paralyzed by the unsurmountable workload before them. If you really want to help them, you need to provide encouragement, support, *and structure*. They will either figure it out, or they will be able to drop the class and focus their energies elsewhere rather than languish and feel guilty about wasting their professor‚Äôs grace.¬†

For context, I teach composition at a cc with a reputable transfer rate, so there are both high and low achieving students with what we might call ""bad habits."" Here are the new policies that I put in my syllabi this semester:

**Late work**

* Low stakes assignments (mostly discussion posts and reading response): no later than one week past the deadline for half credit
* Major essay assignments: a single-use late pass good for 72 hours. Otherwise, 11 point deduction from a 100-point assignment (meaning no A possible) the first day, and 5 points deducted each day thereafter

**Attendance**

* 2 permitted absences, no questions asked. Third absence results in 5% deduction from overall grade. The deduction doubles with each additional absence. So a fourth absence makes it nearly impossible to get an A, and a sixth absence results in a failing grade.¬†

**Tardiness**

* I take attendance at the beginning of class. If a student arrives after I‚Äôve gone through the roster, then I mark them as late. After they‚Äôve been late 3 times, all additional late arrivals will still be recorded as absences and will count toward the attendance policy.

It is not in my nature to be this strict, but I felt that it was what my students needed after 4 years of (warranted) unlimited grace. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt do this last semester, maybe even last year.

**TL;DR**

Get stricter with your attendance and late work policies! You and your students will benefit from it.¬†¬†¬†

P.S. Yes, I am posting this as a form of procrastination to avoid the finals I need to get back to grading.

11e836r,Heartbroken and seeking clarity,"I figured I post here because I was lurking on this subreddit for a while to learn and saw a lot of posts about the difficulties of relationships.

I was in a long-distance relationship with a med student and made an effort to understand her busy schedule. I even browsed the subreddit every day to learn and understand. However, the lack of quality time together basically caused me to have attachment anxiety. I slowly addressed what I needed so I didn't cause unwanted pressure. I even mentioned that I had a lot of free time so whenever she was free and wanted to chat, she could call and FaceTime whenever. Eventually, when I didn't get anything, we had to schedule it instead. We did manage to schedule a FaceTime call once a week, not enough, but it was better than going months or weeks without one like before. We even spent time together in person during winter break and there was no sign of anything wrong. All was good until she had to move back because of the start of the semester. Again, I tried to understand and thought I could take it temporarily because classes, matching, and boards were causing her some major anxiety and stress.

A couple of days before, she seemed aggressive and mean through text. That continued the next day, and she seemed quieter than usual, so I asked her why she was quiet and if everything was good (my anxious attachment acting up). She lashed out again and told me that she was dying from studying, as usual. It just felt like she was saying I didn't understand her without saying it directly. Like I knew she was studying but just wanted to check up on her because it was causing me anxiety. I did something similar months before, but it was not as bad, and we clarified the misunderstanding because it is really hard to tell through text. Then the breakup text came right after.

The breakup came all of a sudden because even though she had told me how much she was stressed, she did not communicate the potential of a breakup. The reason she gave was that she could not meet my needs even though it was the bare minimum. She said she was too busy and anxious after the second semester her M2 started.

I have been struggling to accept this as the reason because I feel this is something we could have talked about before at least. Even if I did something wrong or it was me I would like to know so I can fix these issues. I didn't even get a call, and it was all via text. No chance to talk it out or anything because I just accepted it at the moment. We never had any arguments before, and she never mentioned anything that she felt was wrong in the relationship. I even asked her to communicate anything that bothered her to me because all I wanted to do was support her.

Even after the breakup, I did not argue back and just thanked her and went no contact. I do think it's best for both of us to have this space, and she can focus on med school and boards without unnecessary drama. I am just extremely hurt because I wanted it to work and gave it my all. I tried to communicate as much as I could but never got that in return.

I know this is just my side of the story, and I am not going to contact her until she reaches out to me, which I feel is not going to happen ever for some reason. I feel like I was suffocating her in the relationship even though I just wanted basic things and communication. I want med students' opinions on my story.

Note: I went down this rabbit hole about attachment theory. I saw a lot of anxious attachment in me, while I saw a lot of avoidant behavior in her which is causing me to not accept the reason she gave me.

TLDR: Med school GF broke up with me because she did not have time for me, and I am confused about the real reason because of a lack of communication. I am going no contact for my healing but want answers from her.

Edit: Thank you for the kind words. I am on the right path to recovery and getting back out there. I know relationships don't work sometimes and it's okay to break up. But it's the way it ended that left me hurting.

Edit 2:  I am already working on my anxious attachment. I never had this before and a lot of it probably came out because I felt like I was not getting my needs met. I should have addressed it sooner but I was afraid.

Edit 3: I have come to the conclusion that she felt that the relationship was not worth it for her and ended things. I know she does not owe me anything including talking, giving a reason, or anything. I simply need to move on and let go of hope. Thank you, everyone, and good luck.

Edit 4: I have no hate against anyone in this. I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings. Maybe I was too lovey-dovey and smothered her too much. I just did what felt right in the moment.

Edit 5: I learned that we might have been trauma bonding. I ignored my needs and put hers first. I realized that I made some mistakes where I sometimes blamed her for canceling on me frequently or not getting me what I wanted. I will further explore this with my therapists. I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I was not aware of. I will try to learn from them and fix them.

Final Edit: it‚Äôs the next day! I have slept with everyone‚Äôs comments. I understand that sometimes relationships don‚Äôt work because of a lot of different things. I need to stop overthinking and move on. Thank you again!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11e836r/heartbroken_and_seeking_clarity/

Then my brother died of cancer.

Then I was diagnosed with cancer. I didn‚Äôt tell my family‚Äîeveryone was already grieving, and I couldn‚Äôt put more weight on them. I only told a small handful of people.

I went through radiation and chemotherapy during COVID. I was bedridden for months. I caught COVID during treatment.

1f1ftiw,Advice and a word of caution to PhD Prospects ," Dearest ones, I know you hear this a lot, but I believe words of advice and caution should always be given when necessary.First of all congratulations for having the courage and drive to want to embark on ur phd, we are all proud of you. However, choosing the right SUPERVISOR is one of the most crucial decisions you'll make during your PhD journey. It's essential to conduct thorough research on potential supervisors beyond just their academic achievements or the number of publications they have. Look into their track record of successfully graduating students. Find out how long it typically takes for their students to complete their degrees and whether these students are mentally happy and emotionally ok after completing their PhD. It‚Äôs also invaluable to reach out to former students, especially those who are no longer affiliated with the supervisor. These individuals can provide honest, unfiltered insights into what working with that supervisor is really like. Don't shy away from asking the tough questions about their supervisory style, expectations, and the reality of working under their guidance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Beware of the allure of a supervisor who appears overly supportive or charming during the beginning of communication process. Sometimes, supervisors might present themselves as the perfect match or as someone who cares deeply about your success. It's easy to be swayed when you're eager to secure a position or when you're impressed by their reputation, but remember that nothing is more important than your mental health and overall well-being. A supportive and understanding supervisor can make your PhD experience rewarding, while a mismatch can lead to unnecessary stress, depression,  burnout, and a challenging experience.

Your mental health and well-being are paramount, so choose wisely. No degree or academic achievement is worth compromising your peace of mind and happiness.You got this, we are all rooting for you.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1f1ftiw/advice_and_a_word_of_caution_to_phd_prospects/
xdjuh0,Extremely Disruptive Class. Should I escalate to the Dean?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Right now I am taking a very challenging morning math course and there is a group of about 8 guys who all seem to have known each other previously and they are so extremely loud that is very disrespectful to not only the professor but for the rest of the students. This has been happening since day one of school and I had immediately reached out to the professor which he did not reply to the email but I think he read it because the following day he attempted to quiet down the group.

&#x200B;

They often loudly side talk, mimic/mock the professors accent, make unfunny jokes to amongst themselves (making sure to laugh very loudly in the process), and explain the material to themselves while the professor is already in the process of doing so. 

I have already reached out to the professor once but I am absolutely miserable in this class and I dread going to it because of this group. I can barely even hear. I am sure I am not the only student that feels this way because I often look around and see annoyed and exhausted faces while they are being disruptive.

I don‚Äôt want strict deadlines or throughput targets (e.g., ‚Äúfinish 1 paper in X days‚Äù). My plan is simply: sit with a paper for one hour each day, try to understand as much as possible, take notes, and only set stricter goals once I‚Äôm more competent.

A few things I‚Äôm curious about::

* What will I actually be able to do after 4 years of this?
* Is 1 hour/day sustainable long-term or should I change the rhythm?
* Should I start with surveys/short papers or dive into full research articles immediately?
* Focus broadly across fields or pick one area by year 2‚Äì3?
* Realistic checkpoints at 6 months / 1 year / 2 years / 4 years?
* When could I reasonably expect to contribute to research (coauthor, reproduce+improve results, write an expository note)?
* Best way to approach professors or grad students for mentorship?
* Common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid burnout or getting stuck?
* Any tools/workflows that made a big difference for you?

Thanks!

TL;DR: Is it worth reading math research papers 1 hour/day for 4 years? How should I do it and what will I gain?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1n1ktbr/thinking_of_reading_1_hourday_of_math_research/
1j0o8t2,Do I hate college or do I hate my major?,"Context: When I was in high school, I LOVED school. I loved learning, I loved doing hard things, and I performed pretty well. Of course, I had subjects I struggled in, but it always seemed to work out and I graduated in the top 5% of my class. I balanced a lot of extracurriculars, had a job, had hundreds of volunteer hours, and didn‚Äôt have much issue with multitasking (at least compared to now). I eventually got accepted to my current college‚Äôs honors program on a full ride.

When I went to college, I majored in Civil Engineering‚Äîdespite the fact that I feel more confident in the humanities/social sciences. But I‚Äôm not too deterred by not knowing something. Personally, I believe that the whole point of college is to challenge yourself to learn new things. I‚Äôve learned a lot more in STEM subjects that I had no idea about a year ago. 

I‚Äôm currently in my sophomore year and I‚Äôm SERIOUSLY struggling. I have friends who call themselves dumb, but have so much more of an idea as to what‚Äôs going on in class. They‚Äôll get Bs on exams and I‚Äôll get Ds. I attend so many office hours, study until extremely late, meet with my TAs, try to learn from friends, and my grades are still shit. I often dread going to classes because I never understand what‚Äôs going on, and I always feel so exhausted. My GPA has never been so low, and I feel so, so stupid. In high school, I never was ‚Äúnaturally smart‚Äù‚Äîif anything, I think I‚Äôm very slow to learn. I need to work three times as much to understand concepts, especially math-science related ones. 

I now don‚Äôt know what to do. My grades are plummeting, the advice I‚Äôve received from professors has been like, ‚ÄúStudy harder,‚Äù and I‚Äôve never felt so bad about school before. I‚Äôm not even sure what I want to do with this degree, and I only really chose it because of its flexibility, demand, and high paying rate. 

I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt pursuing a STEM degree mainly for financial reasons. I grew up low-income, and am worried that I‚Äôll have worked so hard just to not make enough. I only have so many years left before I graduate‚Ä¶ and I really need help.

1lhvh63,Advice on being confident during surgery rotation?,"Can yall give me advice on how to be confident and assertive? I‚Äôm on my surgery rotation and I really want to do well, but I‚Äôm a high introversion/high anxiety person with ADHD and chronic fatigue. I find it so hard to speak up for myself and try to get noticed.

I want to make sure that the residents and doctors see that I‚Äôm interested and genuinely want to learn as much as possible (despite being absolutely exhausted). What sucks is ON TOP of the social anxiety and low self esteem is that I have a naturally neutral expression and monotone voice.

1j33g3i,Massive Leap of Faith,"So, where do I even start.

The other day I just found out I have some serious health issues (my doctor is thinking I might have cancer, still have to run more tests.) It runs in my family, a bunch of women die young in my family from it, I have made peace with it. However, that on top of my insomnia has made me actually miserable.

I am currently at University, but I decided to drop out, and I am looking into getting an online degree. It has nothing to do with me not trying hard enough, I just simply realized how much I hate school here. I have no friends, I have nothing here that is worth saving. I am in one of the best schools for my major, specifically for education, but I just no longer feel a desire to be here. 

There are other things going into this as well. As I live a few hours away from home, it is not easy seeing a doctor. I do not have a car (sold it for textbooks lol,) so the constant back and forth has been so expensive. With my insomnia, I keep staying awake for 2-3 days at a time and falling asleep in dangerous places (school bathrooms, one time on a bench, on my bathroom floor.) I am concerned for my safety at this point.

Due to my McKinney Vento status, I do not even know what I am going to do in regards of transferring financial credits. I am dropping out now, I can't stay anymore. I am probably going to just pack my things and not come back during spring break. 

I'm doing an accelerated course in Creative Writing and English and will either do my masters in education or my state offers an internship for teachers to start teaching while they receive their certificates and whatnot.

Right now, I have to clean up my health and start working to afford a new car. I don't know why I'm posting this, but any words of advice will help greatly.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1j33g3i/massive_leap_of_faith/
vw3u15,Things I wish someone told me before I started college,"Since many people will be going off to college for the first time in about a month, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to make this post. I recommend you read everything, but you can certainly skip around if you wish. Also, just because this post is geared toward people who haven't been to college before doesn't mean returning students won't find any good advice here. I encourage all college students to check out this post, and if you've been to college before feel free to share your own insight too!

&#x200B;

***\[1\] Academics- Building A Good Schedule***

* **Get familiar with the logistics of course selection**. Many colleges have specific websites or platforms used to pick classes. Each school does it a bit differently, so make sure you know what to expect.
* **Know the exact day and time you can start picking classes**. You want the best chance of getting into the classes you want, especially if you‚Äôre a freshman with little to no credits earned. With that said, it‚Äôs okay if you get an undesirable schedule! You earn new credits and get earlier pick times each semester, meaning you‚Äôll have more and more classes to choose from.
* **Have backups for your classes**. As discussed above, you might not get into all the classes you want, but you still need to take at least 12 credits per semester to remain a full-time student.
* **Put together a balanced schedule**. Avoid making your schedule too challenging during the first semester or two; instead, add 1-2 interesting general education classes to your schedule. If your very first semester is difficult academically, you can get overwhelmed keeping up with academic expectations while also learning how to adjust to a new living environment, maintain a social life, get enough sleep, etc. Once you‚Äôve been here for at least a semester, you‚Äôll know how to succeed outside of academics and will be able to focus more on excelling in class.
* **Use RateMyProfessors wisely**. Sometimes you must take a certain class for your major or the only person teaching it has bad reviews, but for gen eds or classes where there are multiple instructors it‚Äôs best to choose someone with good reviews. Also, while I have found the website to be rather accurate when professors have many reviews, gauging quality objectively becomes much harder when there are just a few reviews.
* **Consider taking an early morning class**. . Dragging yourself to an 8 or 9 am might seem awful, but keep in mind that many clubs and social events take place during weekday evenings and you could miss them if you have late classes. Of course, if you absolutely cannot wake up early and have alternative options, then don't take a morning class! This tip is just food for thought for people who aren't a fan of morning classes but could technically handle one.
* **It's okay to drop a class**. It's important to deal with challenges in life, but sometimes you show up to class just a few times and realize how unreasonable the workload or professor is. If the class isn't required for your major or you can take it another time with another professor, drop it! You don't want one thing to make your entire semester miserable. Also, if you drop a class within the first week or two you avoid getting a W on your transcript.
* **Map out the classes you plan to take each semester during your freshman year**. To do so, get familiar with general education requirements and the required courses for your major. Most advisors will be happy to help you with this if you ask them. You can also reach out to an upperclassman in your major since they know which classes they took each semester.

***\[2\] Academics- How To Succeed In Your Classes***

* **Read the syllabus**. First, you avoid wasting your professor‚Äôs time because you asked a question outlined in the syllabus. Second, you get a sense of course expectations, assignment descriptions, and due dates early on. Sure, you won‚Äôt memorize every single detail or due date by reading it once, but you can always refer to the document as needed.
* **Spend money on textbooks wisely**. Please don‚Äôt buy any textbooks until you are absolutely sure you need them! In other words, you must go to class and hear from the professor that the book is required. If you end up needing the textbook, here's what to know: Unless your professor requires an access code, try to find a cheaper version of the book. Amazon is a good resource because they have a wide selection of textbooks and often allow you to rent or buy e-books. E-books have many advantages: they‚Äôre generally cheaper than physical books, don‚Äôt take up space, and it‚Äôs easy to find certain terms using the search feature.
* **Don‚Äôt skip class**. Not going to class once is like a gateway drug ‚Äì after that, it‚Äôs easy to justify not going whenever you‚Äôre tired or just not feeling it. The only exception is when you‚Äôre really sick and can‚Äôt focus on the lecture anyway.
* **Sit in the front during class**. Sitting in a spot where the professor can easily see you will make you more likely to be attentive. Also, professors think more positively of students who sit up front since they tend to be studious.
* **Be respectful to classmates**. You're not the only person going to class, so please make fellow students' experience as conducive to learning as possible. Eating in class, talking to friends, and asking the professor too many questions are a few ways you may distract your peers. Refrain from such behaviors, as you wouldn't like it if someone did it to you.
* **Figure out your note-taking style(s)**. Will you take notes with a pen and paper, a laptop, a tablet, or a combination? There are many factors to consider, including but not limited to:
   * Will the class involve calculations or diagrams that require pen and paper?
   * Can you handwrite quickly and neatly enough?
   * Can you type quickly enough?
   * Can you avoid the distractions of a laptop or tablet?
   * Can you afford a tablet?
* **Study your notes after each class or review the notes from all your classes at the end of each day**. Doing so reduces the stress brought on by cramming the night before, and it helps you retain information better because you‚Äôre reviewing it regularly.
* **If you have assigned textbook readings, read them before and after the lecture**. Before a lecture, reading the textbook familiarizes you with the content. After a lecture, reading the textbook serves as a recap of the lesson, and it also reveals confusing topics that would be helpful to go over during office hours.
* **If you‚Äôre struggling with the material, get help from your professor during office hours.** No matter how small your question is, it‚Äôs better to get it answered early instead of letting everything pile up right before an exam. You also start building a connection with your professor, which will help you later down the road ‚Äì check the ‚ÄúExtracurriculars‚Äù section for more on this.
* **Avoid using your phone or other distractions until your work is done**. The more time you spend on distractions, the less time you have to do work. Also, even if you ‚Äúonly‚Äù spend 10 minutes doing something else, you end up losing more time than that because it takes time to refocus on the task at hand.
* **Start projects early**. You don‚Äôt need to complete the whole project the day it‚Äôs assigned; just work on a bit each day to start, and as the deadline gets closer increase the workload.
* **Know how to handle group projects**. Whenever you can, work with just 1-2 people you trust, as coordinating schedules with fewer people is easier and it's less likely you'll have to deal with a terrible group member. Make a group chat with all group members and get in touch with each other soon after the project is assigned to discuss responsibilities and a list of deadlines. Even if you don't get to work on the project yet, having these expectations upfront will help later down the road. Whenever possible, make sure you can all work on the project without needing to meet at the same time. If it is necessary to meet at the same time, at least try to do it via Zoom so people don't have to worry about making it to a certain location at a certain time. Use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com) to figure out when the most people are available! Once you have gotten together with the group, use your time together wisely by getting to work right away. Many people fear group work because it becomes a bad experience whenever certain members refuse to do their fair share of the work. Definitely try to reason with such members first, but if they don't budge or are unresponsive to communication in general, don't be afraid to ask the professor for help.
* **Always do the extra credit**. Even if you're doing well in the class now, there might be a tough assignment or exam later in the semester that lowers your grade.
* **Make at least one friend in your major**. That way you can support each other academically. Reviewing material together is often more enjoyable and can help you truly grasp the content by ‚Äúteaching‚Äù it to someone else.
* **Let your professor know about any personal issues going on in your life**. If you (or a loved one) are going through mental or physical health issues, are in a tough spot financially, etc. let your professor know. Even though they can't help directly, they'll be more understanding when you don‚Äôt submit the best work or need extra time to complete assignments.
* **Keep in touch with your advisor.** Some people might show up at college knowing exactly what they want and how to get there, but most students still need some type of guidance. Talk with your advisor about how classes are going, what activities you want to get involved with, what you want to do after graduation, etc. Advisors can give you practical advice about these topics, especially if you reach out to them early.
* **Check out academic support resources offered by the university**. Depending on the university you attend, there may be centers that provide general study tips, math help, writing help, and so on. Ask your advisor what services your college offers. They‚Äôre ‚Äúfree‚Äù because you pay tuition ‚Äì use them!

&#x200B;

***\[3\] Organization & Time Management***

* **Find out where each class is located in advance**. Instead of scrambling to find your class on the first day, walk the campus the day before to learn how to get to each building and room. Pay attention to long it takes to get from one location to another so you know when to leave to get to your destination on time. This is especially helpful if your campus is big!
* **Get around campus efficiently**. If your dorm is far from most classes, don‚Äôt come back until the end of the day; instead, find spots to study close to your classes. This is particularly useful when the weather is bad and you want to spend as little time outside as possible. Also, even if your campus has buses, actually using one tends to be inefficient because you‚Äôll probably spend more time waiting for it than it takes to get to your destination. Save the bus for bad weather when it‚Äôs not practical to walk to class.
* **Use a digital calendar and to-do list**. Google Calendar can be used to mark academic events (e.g. when you have class, assignment due dates, exam dates) and non-academic events (e.g. work, clubs, social events). Reminder apps such as Todoist are great for smaller tasks we tend to forget if they aren‚Äôt written down, such as making a phone call. I know iPhones have a designated Reminder app and I‚Äôm sure other smartphones do too, but I prefer Todoist because it has more features, such as allowing you to create subtasks within a task.
* **Avoid having unreasonably high expectations for what you can accomplish in a day**. It‚Äôs better to put fewer tasks on your to-do list and add more, rather than add too many and get upset if you can‚Äôt get everything done. Maybe you would love to study for three tests, work a 5-hour shift, hang out with friends, go to the gym, and attend a club meeting all in one day, but this might not be possible. Learn to prioritize what needs to get done.
* **Stay disciplined**. Although some aspects of your schedule like classes or work shifts are set in stone, you‚Äôll still find ‚Äúempty‚Äù blocks of time on weekdays. Make sure you use this unstructured time wisely by designating it for important tasks like studying. That way, you can get work done efficiently and then have the weekend to rest, hang out with friends, or review the material.
* **Keep your physical workspace neat.** Focusing on your studies is challenging when your desk is filled with things that are irrelevant to what you‚Äôre doing at the moment. We often place items on our desk when we‚Äôre lazy or don‚Äôt know what to do with it, so start being mindful of this. When you put something on your desk, always ask yourself if there‚Äôs any better place it could go. I know dorm space is often limited, but just try your best!
* **Organize your computer.** Even though there it‚Äôs not physical clutter, having a disorganized computer still makes productivity difficult. Avoid having too many unread emails, place important emails in designated folders, save bookmarks for commonly-used websites, create folders for each class you‚Äôre taking, keep your desktop neat, and so on. 

&#x200B;

***\[4\] Dorm Life***

* S**tart making a college dorm supply list early**. It can be overwhelming to figure out what you really need for your dorm. To minimize the stress, start creating a packing list at least a few weeks before you leave, writing down some of the most essential items to bring. To do so, check out packing lists online and see what things are listed repeatedly. Then, go about your days and take note of everything you use on a daily or otherwise regular basis. Also consider what problems you might run into at college and what supplies you would need in such cases ‚Äì for example, what will you do if you get sick, when it gets cold outside, etc.?
* **Be a respectful roommate**. Even if you don‚Äôt do unequivocally bad things like bringing unannounced guests or turning the room into a pigsty, your habits may still annoy someone else. For example, if you like calling friends or family in the room often, some people find it distracting. Ask your roommate what they don‚Äôt like and try your best to accommodate their needs within reason.
* **It‚Äôs okay not to be best friends with your roommate as long as you get along**. In fact, it‚Äôs better not to be super close so you have the motivation to branch out and make new friends.
* **Always try to sort out conflicts with your roommate before escalating things to the RA**. Many roommate disagreements are minor enough to be sorted out between the roommates. By doing so, you learn how to deal with interpersonal conflict, which is an important life skill.
* **Your RA is not just there to help you with roommate issues.** RAs receive extensive training on how to help peers have a successful experience on campus, so reach out to them if you‚Äôre feeling homesick, having a hard time making friends, struggling academically, etc. Even if they can‚Äôt help you directly, they will find the best resources for your situation.
* **Don‚Äôt sit in your room all day**. It might be easy to spend time in your room whenever you don‚Äôt have class, but it prevents you from exploring all that campus has to offer. Also, your roommate may need personal space sometimes and that isn‚Äôt possible if you‚Äôre always around.
* **Do laundry when things aren‚Äôt too busy.** Laundry rooms tend to be pretty empty when most people are sleeping (early in the morning), afternoons at the start of the week (Mon, Tues), and when people are going out (Friday or Saturday night). On the other hand, afternoons at the end of the week and Sundays are generally busy. It‚Äôs also a good idea to scope out your specific laundry room to see when it‚Äôs the most or least busy. Another tip: stay in your dorm while you do laundry to catch up on homework or perhaps tidy your room since you‚Äôre already in the cleaning mindset!
* **Always take your keys and lock the door**. Do this whether you‚Äôre going to the bathroom for a few minutes or will be gone the whole day. The people on your floor may be perfectly trustworthy, but you never know for sure.
* **Decorate your room at least a little bit**. Even putting up a tapestry or some fairy lights will help make your space more cozy and relaxing.
* **Don‚Äôt go home every weekend or call your family all the time**. College is meant to be a stepping stone to living completely alone. Make sure you can be without your family while you still have thousands of people around you for support.

&#x200B;

***\[5\] Extracurriculars***

* **Start making connections with professors as soon as you can**. You can do so by participating in class, asking follow-up questions after class, and asking them about their research. Knowing at least 2-3 professors well can provide you with quality job references and strong recommendation letters for grad programs and/or scholarships.
* **Get involved in a professional and just-for-fun experience ‚Äì at least one of each**. Professional experiences include research or a job/internship related to your major. Having this under your belt allows you to obtain valuable experiences and soft skills you can discuss in an interview. Just-for-fun experiences include clubs or intramural sports. These allow you to take a break from school while doing something enjoyable and making friends.
* **Sign up for a bunch of clubs at the start of the semester**. Join the email list for each club that sounds remotely interesting, and then you can decide whether you truly have an interest in that activity or are free when meetings are held.
* **Get a part-time job on campus**. There are many benefits to working: You have money to spend on ‚Äúfun‚Äù things like going out or ordering things online, can start saving for the future, and improve your time management skills by balancing work with school. I recommend doing no more than 10-15 hours a week, though it‚Äôs possible you have such a busy schedule that you can‚Äôt work at all. As far as getting a job, most colleges have a portal with on-campus job listings ‚Äì find out how to access and use it. Many students end up at a dining hall or do some type of office/administrative work. Generally speaking, dining hall jobs are easier to get but require more hard work, while office/administrative jobs are harder to get but give you some time to catch up on homework. A few tips for getting a job: If you don't get an invitation to interview within a few weeks of submitting your application and there was a contact person listed on the job description, follow up with them. Since many people don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôll make you stand out. Also, many colleges offer resume critiques and practice interviews that make you a better applicant, so find out how to access this help.

&#x200B;

***\[6\] Social Life***

* **Take advantage of the first few weeks during the semester when everyone is looking to make friends**. If you see someone sitting alone in the dining hall, ask them if they‚Äôd like some company. If your dorm has common areas where people hang out, chat with someone there. If you arrive to class early and see a classmate, strike up a conversation with them. Whenever you come across situations like these, ask the person their name, their major, where they‚Äôre from, how they‚Äôve spent their time at college so far, etc. Then invite them to join you the next time you go to the dining hall, library, or another public space on campus. If you were friendly during the initial interaction, they are likely to say yes.
* **Say yes if anyone offers to hang out**. Even if you don‚Äôt like them at first, they might end up being really nice! This is particularly important if you don‚Äôt know many people yet.
* **Be prepared for unique opportunities to make friends**. Being in the same major, class, or club are excellent ways to meet new people, but they‚Äôre not the only ones! To use a personal example, once I got locked out of my room and couldn‚Äôt text my roommate since my phone was still in there. I ended up borrowing the phone of a girl in my dorm lounge and we became friends.
* **Don‚Äôt let your past social life set you back**. Even if you were socially awkward or disliked in high school, you now have a fresh start! There‚Äôs no way everyone can know each other, especially if it‚Äôs a big campus, meaning you won‚Äôt have the reputation you did back in your hometown. Even if you end up not clicking with someone, there are plenty of other people to meet. Likewise, if you were embarrassed about your interests or personality back then, keep in mind that college is a much more diverse place so almost everyone can find like-minded people to connect with.
* **Once you establish some friendships, make plans with someone at least once a week**. Whether you grab food, study, or go to an event, it‚Äôs important to have some type of regular social support. With that being said‚Ä¶
* **It‚Äôs perfectly okay to be alone in college sometimes**. No one will judge you for eating alone at the dining hall or walking to class by yourself. In fact, spending time alone is great for personal growth and ensures you don‚Äôt rely on others for all your happiness. 
* **Quality over quantity**. This saying holds true for many things in life. In this case, a few friends who‚Äôll be there for you in times of need is better than 20 fake friends.
* **Be smart with your money.** Going out or ordering delivery with friends is fun but try to keep it as a reward rather than a weekly (or even more often) occurrence. Also, consider getting a credit card to start building credit, as long as you‚Äôre responsible with it and avoid debt! Tell yourself that the credit card is just like a debit card, otherwise you'll fall into the mindset that it's ""free"" money.

&#x200B;

***\[7\] Health & Wellness***

* **Get enough sleep**. Health experts recommend getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night, but if this isn't possible try to get 7 hours, or 6 at the very least. Sleep is so important for mental and physical health, and it leads to better academic performance. People who get enough sleep usually find it easier to learn new information and review old information. Though some people seem to get by just fine when they pull all-nighters, for the vast majority of people getting adequate sleep is the best way to do well academically.
* **Try to eat 3 balanced meals a day**. If you don‚Äôt have time for breakfast in the dining hall, at least have snacks you can eat before you head to class. For lunch, eat a meal that includes carbs (ex. rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) and veggies. For dinner, eat some carbs and veggies, plus some protein (ex. chicken, fish, beans). I know it‚Äôs tempting to just eat grilled cheese and burgers, but that should be an occasional treat rather than a daily occurrence.
* **Stay hydrated**. Drink something with every meal at the very least, and then anytime you‚Äôre thirsty. Water is best but tea, coffee, or juice is okay too. Consume sugary drinks like soda in moderation.
* **Work out when you can**. Even if it‚Äôs hard to get to the gym 5 days a week, you can still incorporate physical activity into your life in creative ways. For example, walk as much as you can, do stretches in your room, run up your dorm stairs, go on jogs around campus, arrange weekend bike rides with friends, etc.
* **Make your mental health a priority**. Taking a few moments to take a deep breath, meditating, having social support on campus, and reaching out to family back home are a few ways to maintain your mental health. Having a relaxing nighttime routine by listening to music, reading a book, or doing another activity that calms you is another great idea, as the time before bed is often the only time you don‚Äôt have to rush to be somewhere or do something. In general, maintaining mental health requires you to learn what works for you while recognizing when you might benefit from professional help like therapy.
* **Spend time outside**. Most college campuses are beautiful and have lovely places to study or relax outside. It really depends on the specific college you attend, but simply walking around campus for a few weeks will help you discover some of the best outdoor areas to spend time.
* **Tackle your fears**. Everyone is afraid of different things, but no matter what they are it‚Äôs important to face them head-on. For example, I used to hate calling on the phone, but then I got a job on campus where I had to call people regularly and my fear of the phone was reduced. Remember that getting out of your comfort zone is about more than learning to cope with a particular fear ‚Äì it also does wonders for your entire self-esteem and motivates you to strive for success in all aspects of your life.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vw3u15/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_i_started/

I‚Äôm trying to catch up but I can‚Äôt slug through 8 hours at a time. I recovered for the most part but can still only get in about 5 hours of work a day before I‚Äôm too exhausted to think. 

Worse still, the more I think about the lost work time and the amount of work I have to do to salvage everything, the more anxious and paralyzed I become. It‚Äôs slowing me down even worse!

How do you map your way out when you get really, really behind? Not just preventative time management‚Ä¶but how do you climb out of a hole once you‚Äôre in it? Would love some strategy tips for taming this mountain of deadlines I‚Äôm buried under.

1wd24j,Just starting my second year of my PhD and I hate it. Please can somebody give me some advice?,"I'm Australian and the way the system works here is 3 year undergraduate degree, 1 year honours degree (a research year where you do a project and write a thesis) and then after that you can either do a PhD (3 years) or masters (2 years). I went the PhD route. I went straight from school to undergrad, then did honours, then on to my PhD without taking any sort of break between those things. Which, in hindsight, was a mistake. However I didn't think so because I loved research. My undergraduate degree was in biomedical science, which I loved, then my honours degree was in neuroscience, which I also loved. I thought I was totally ready and willing to do a PhD. I thought I'd love it.

I don't.

My project isn't really working and I don't even care why. I just go to uni every day, do my time in the lab, then come home. Everybody keeps telling me I need to join the student committee, get a tutoring job, stay up to date with big conferences I might be interested in going to, look for scholarships I might be eligible for, don't get behind in reading the literature...on top of actually doing experiments. I know this is normal everyday PhD student stuff that everyone else seems to cope with really well. But I can't cope with any of it. I want to tell everyone to shut the fuck up because just going to uni every day is bad enough without having to do all that extra stuff on top. I want to quit.

Now, this is where I need your help.

I have absolutely no idea how to quit, or what will be available to me if I do. Ideally I'd want to get a research assistant job, because I really like science - I just think I made a mistake jumping into my PhD too early. Would it be possible to quit, work for a while, then start a whole new PhD in a few years? Would research groups even still take me on as a research assistant? I don't have any job experience because (idiotically) I listened to my family and focused on doing well at university instead of working. I didn't think that would matter because science doesn't care about your prior work experience at the supermarket, but it really does matter, and my resume is pathetic. 

The other option is just completing my PhD and then trying to get a research assistant job. I don't know whether that's a good idea or not though, because I know some labs won't hire research assistants with a PhD.

I'm trying to find a guidance counselor to talk to about this, but my department doesn't seem to offer one. So until I find somebody...please help me? What are my options?

**TL;DR** Just starting my second year of my PhD and hating it. Should I quit and try to find work as a research assistant, or should I just soldier on and see what happens at the end.

Lowkey excited to start working as a big boy now, but also biggest fear (besides imposter syndrome, making clinical errors, not having time to play Pok√©mon, follow kpop bla bla) is how tf do I stay looking cute during internship? During placements in med school, I always got compliments from doctors, nurses, patients etc on my outfits, skin etc (sadly no compliments on clinical skills), but I was horrified to see that most of y'all's fits dont pass the vibe check.

Anyways, with internship starting soon, how do I have time to not look crusty? Chile I too booked and busy to do clinical audit/publication, so I finna  contribute meaningfully to the hospital culture through my cute fits and glazed doughnut visual, so hoping that scores me some CV points for surgical training (jks I actually like myself, so won't do surg)

Do I have to wear scrubs every day as a lowlife intern? Will I really not have any time to do my 7 step K-beauty skincare routine?

I'm afraid of not spending enough time and then having to run myself ragged before defense. On the other hand, I am also afraid of burnout.

I tried to do an eight hour work day for four days a week this semester, but I found that I just ended up procrastinating and being depressed about how much work needed to be done that day and then being depressed that I couldn't hit the 8 hour mark.  I lasted for a month or two trying to do this, but I could not do focused work for that long. (For the other days of the week, I spent two of them on the research work for my assistantship and then took one day off per week.) I ended up in massive burnout, which is kinda where I'm at now.

Maybe I'd be better off trying for 2-3 hours of focused work per day using a Pomodoro timer? Then I could spend the latter portion of the day working on research for my assistantship, since it's a bit easier on my brain (lots of database management).

1htowf4,The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival),"Hi everyone. I am in the final year of a part-time PhD. I have been struggling with procrastination and lack of motivation for a very long time. Things are bleak for me - but I do want to complete. And I continue to explore ways to do so.

Today it hit me that what would be really useful was some kind of guide. Some kind of roadmap or pattern for a PhD. No-one has talked to me about this and I have not seen such a thing elsewhere \[they may exist, I just haven't seen them\].

So I created this ""8 Stages of PhD"" as a kind of map to help myself. But after I finished it I thought it might help others. So I'm posting it here.

**It is quite subjective** and very relevant to my own experience. But I'm sure others will relate to it too.

Transparency: This was a 'collaboration' with Google Gemini and ChatGPT. They wrote a lot of it \[but I write my own material when it comes to other stuff!\]. This was for my personal guidance, but after I had it I thought I'd share it anyway. Hopefully it helps a few others.

\----

**The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival)**

**1. Euphoric Anticipation:**

* You‚Äôre just starting out. You're bursting with ideas and ambition. The world is your oyster, and you‚Äôve got the perfect thesis in mind. Motivation is *overflowing*.
* ""I‚Äôm going to revolutionise this field!"" you declare, ready to change everything. Insight: You might change your mind a hundred times, but that‚Äôs okay.

**2. Methodical Mania:**

* You dive headlong into research. The literature review becomes your universe, an endless rabbit hole of papers you *must* read.
* Your excitement is laced with creeping anxiety: ‚ÄúHow do I organise this chaos into something coherent?‚Äù Insight: eventually it *will* happen. You'll get there.

**3. Impostor Syndrome Strikes:**

* The doubts creep in. ""What if I‚Äôm not smart enough for this?"" ""Is my research even *worthwhile*?""
* Insight: it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to everyone else. But remember: they‚Äôre just as lost as you feel. You‚Äôre *not* an impostor‚Äîyou're just in a deeply uncomfortable stage of PhD growth.

**4. The Data Desert:**

* The moment of despair: you hit a wall. The data either isn‚Äôt coming through or doesn‚Äôt make any sense. What you thought was a breakthrough is now just a puddle of confusion. Everything seems a mess and you have no idea how to organise it.
* Motivation has taken a permanent vacation, and you find yourself deep in the desert, parched for an oasis of progress. You wonder if you'll ever escape this desert. Insight: You will.

**5. The Burnout Abyss:**

* Here it is. You‚Äôre stuck. Every time you sit at your computer, the cursor mocks you. Ideas? Gone. Will to work? Non-existent.
* Procrastination feels like a full-time job. The idea of working on your PhD seems like a Herculean task. You start thinking, ""Maybe I should just take up a new career, like... dog walker?"". You watch ridiculous YouTube videos. You go on social media. You ‚Äútake a break‚Äù after doing nothing for two hours. Rinse and repeat for days, weeks‚Ä¶ or months.
* You stare at your digital folder with dread, feeling like even skimming an abstract is a monumental task. Reading feels pointless, overwhelming, and painfully dull.
* You fantasise about quitting and blame everything and everyone for your inability to work. ""It‚Äôs their fault!"" you cry. You consider therapy. Maybe you even do it.
* **Breakthrough Realisation:** Stop chasing motivation. It‚Äôs not coming. Start chasing *action*. It‚Äôs up to you to discover the way forward. There is a way through the woods, you just have to find it.
* Insight: If you're running low on mental reserves, you need to *lower the stakes*. Instead of e.g. aiming to read an entire paper, just read a paragraph. Instead of focusing on mastery, focus on *progress*.

**6. The Vomit Draft (optional bridge):**

* You stop waiting for perfection and start spilling every half-formed thought onto the page. It‚Äôs messy. It‚Äôs chaotic. But it‚Äôs progress.
* The key here: **lower the bar.** Forget brilliance‚Äîjust focus on getting something down.
* It‚Äôs raw and unrefined, but hey, at least it exists. And from here, you can *polish*.
* Insight: These drafts are not just a stage‚Äîthey‚Äôre a *strategy*. Embrace the chaos. Write poorly. Write messily. Write *anything*. The magic happens in the edit, not the first draft. Vomit drafting gets you from ‚Äúnothing exists‚Äù to ‚Äúsomething I can work with.‚Äù It‚Äôs your bridge from stuck to progress. As Jodi Picoult said, ‚ÄúI can always edit a bad page, I can‚Äôt edit a blank page.‚Äù

**7. The ""Just Finish It"" Frenzy:**

* Panic sets in. The deadline is looming, and suddenly, you realise this is *real*. You start running out of time, and the pressure hits you like a freight train.
* You enter a state of hyperfocus. Adrenaline is your new best friend, and caffeine is your only sustenance. The ‚ÄúJust Finish It‚Äù mentality kicks in.
* Insight: It‚Äôs not about *perfect*‚Äîit‚Äôs about *done*. Finish the damn thing.

**8. The Sweet Release (and Mild PTSD):**

* You defend your thesis. You survive. You succeed. Relief washes over you, but so does disbelief: ""Did I actually do that?!""
* The memories of the burnout and vomit drafts haunt you, but the joy of completion outweighs it all. You‚Äôve earned this.

**The Takeaway**  
Every PhD journey is unique, but the struggles are universal. Whether you breeze through or rely on survival tactics, the key is persistence. Progress isn‚Äôt always pretty, but it‚Äôs progress nonetheless. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect‚Äîyou just have to keep going. Good luck. You *can* do this.

Afterthought: It's possible to create a visual map from this. It could be something like:

1. The Golden Hills; 2. The Cornfield \[aka The Maize\]; 3. The Valley; 4. The Plateau; 5. The Chasm; 6. The Storm Cliffs; 7. The Racetrack; 8. The Mountaintop. This gives it more of a location-based epic computer game feel, but one which you'll eventually win.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1htowf4/the_8_stages_of_phd_the_real_journey_with/
zkh662,TW- medical issue /addictive medication. I'm in pain and scared,"Hi All,

I started my PhD a couple of months ago and things were going well. Earlier this month I started getting a flare up of my sciatic pain (started in 2020). A few weeks ago I ended up in A&E because it became debilitating.

My PI has told me to heal and rest and I am speaking to a consultant this week to discuss my MRI. 

What is breaking me is the fact that, in addition to my pain and exhaustion, the university has been awful about helping. I only need a temp blue badge while I wait for a legal one but they want me to pay over ¬£150 for a permit for the year that MIGHT get me a space within a quarter mile of my office (I can't walk that far) but they aren't sure if they can upgrade it to a disabled permit.

I've been told I can apply for help to pay for it but I need to spend several hours filling in forms and finding the evidence. In addition, I have to reveal all of my financial info to a stranger to judge and justify any payments over ¬£100 in the past 3 months.

The official blue badge will poss take months to get IF they approve it.

I have also been prescribed opiates and I am terrified of addiction but I can't cope with the pain if I don't take them.

I am in so much pain, I am tired and scared, both about my health and my course. I just need moral support and an ear that isn't involved.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/zkh662/tw_medical_issue_addictive_medication_im_in_pain/
1krmsrd,I graduated today. I failed my defence the first time around.,"Just wanted to share for others who may have felt as hopeless I did on that day 3 years ago when I defended and got sent back into my program - that if you don‚Äôt pass your defence you can still graduate. 

Story time: 

Did a PhD abroad. Covid happened. Lost my supervisor after year 1 (he quit). University was not helpful in finding a new one. Actually they were actively unhelpful in finding a new one since they set me up with a prof in a different department who told me he would be my new supervisor if I took his course over the summer, which I did and then at the end of the summer when I asked he had his assistant tell me he forgot and had no funding for more students. 

Eventually I was going to master out but my old co-supervisor finally took me on, it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit skill wise but it was good enough. By this time I had already been working on my PhD for 2 years. He was fairly junior and had only graduated one student before me. By year 3 I was out of money (my funding left with my first supervisor) so we figured we would just try and submit to defend. I was also in an accident and really struggling with school and dealing with pain at this point. In this country 3 years is normal anyways‚Ä¶ we felt I had done enough. 

Unfortunately we misread the rules surrounding co-authorships and one of the panel members took great issue with this - basically me and a fellow student/co author on a paper tried to use the same paper as a whole thesis chapter because we both did two very different parts of a project that became one published paper. Because she submitted first it became against the rules for me to use that same chapter, and the committee stuck to that ruling and effectively ‚Äúfailed‚Äù me in my defence but determined that I had done enough work to merit another shot and sent me back into my program. 

It was horrible. Gut wrenching. To make matters worse the committee members were not nice, and they determined that not only did I have to redo that chapter but since I was going back into the program they wanted major revisions to the other chapters too. The worst part is - now I asked to start paying full tuition again myself, no funding at all, scholarship fully exhausted. 

I was so depressed it actually took me 6 full months to open my thesis document again, and for the first year I barely touched it. Eventually one day I had a moment in the mirror where I was like, if I don‚Äôt finish this it was all for nothing, 100k more student debt for nothing, you have to finish. From then on I took it super seriously.. and I wasn‚Äôt taking chances. Over the next 2 years -working part time on it to reduce my tuition costs and working a full time job- I published a new paper for the new chapter and fixed up the other chapters and got them fully published too. 

I submitted my thesis 4 days before the deadline of me being kicked out for taking too long‚Ä¶ 

They thought I did such a good job on my revisions that I was told I didn‚Äôt have to re-defend, and today I walked the stage.

Don‚Äôt give up. PhDs are fucking hard!

1hnstzj,How bad would it be to quit phd after one semester,"Just finished my first semester and honestly despised it. I pivoted fields a bit to do a particular research topic but that was a huge mistake, and the program has made me extremely miserable. My field is also very depressing r.e. the future which has taken a heavy mental toll on me and makes me question whether it's even worth investing the time to do a phd. I kind of knew these things going in but i thought it (a) would not be this bad and (b) the research would balance it out, but the research has definitely failed on that front. It appears I will be working on extremely tight budgets for my experiments for the forseeable future which makes it very difficult because even from the first semester, it seems the onus is on me to come up with research ideas. My co-PIs also seem to have very different visions of what my PhD is supposed to be about which freaks me out because the things they want are very different and I didn't sign up to do some of those things. I think we also have some fundamental differences on how we want to go about research, i.e. i care more about the mechanisms of how things work vs they care about the engineering applications, those things arent mutually exclusive but it seems like I'll be limited on the mechanism front. 

Anyway tldr first semester sucked, and doesn't look like things are going to get better. I would grit my teeth for another semester, but I have a great job offer on the table. Its not really in my field, but it provides a lot of the flexibility and things that I miss (my field is very limiting geographically even after PhD, which is another thing I've struggled with about this path). I'm very tempted to take it, but I'm also very conflicted, because I don't think i hate doing a PhD, i just hate this one lol. I'm wondering what the potential drawbacks would be in the future of dropping out so early, if i were to take the job and then perhaps reapply elsewhere or do a masters in a year or two. I realise that it doesn't reflect well, but there is a relatively reasonable explanation for why (pivoted fields, didnt work out).

1ja11gb,Student Evals & Tenure,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

To say I'm stressed about my student evals would be an understatement. When I taught a lecture class (aka two 75minute classes per week) as a graduate student, I had excellent student evals, despite stricter policies.

I'm 2.5yrs into my TT position at an R1 university, and my ratings for this semester hover right around the lower 3s (on a scale of 5). For the last two years they've been in the higher 3/lower 4s.

I personally have zero problem with this rating. A 4, after all, means ""very good"" for crying out loud. Yet, every year it is prominently noted on my review how far below the department average I am (which apparently is ~4.6). I'm also constantly being told how important student evals are for tenure. 

Just this week, I collected unofficial midterm feedback and it's high 2s/low 3s. Note that this class is very heavily focused on guests speakers, so my actual lecture time for a 3-credit class since the beginning of the semester has probably been 4, maybe 5 hours. The longest lecture (where I just talked), was 1 hour, everything else was 20-30 here and there.  Number 1 complaint: "" lectures are too long and not engaging enough."" Never mind the fact that when I solicit opinions and try to engage them, I  basically just look at 30 faces who just blankly stare back.  Number 2 complaint: ""the professor is a harsh grader.‚Äù Average assignment grades are usually in the low 90s (or high 80s depending on how many people didn‚Äôt bother to submit). Make it make sense.

I want to emphasize that Im personally okay with this rating. Students get out of their education what they put in. But because my department/college puts so much goddamn emphasis on student evals, I feel like I am doomed. Im in the social sciences, and our dean is riding that ""empathy"" train super hard. 

I think all of my policies are fair and reasonable, and account for some unexpected circumstances that might come up. They're not different from those of my colleagues, assuming they're not straight up lying to me. I don't have data on whether or not or to what extent they enforce them, though this might be the problem. I think it is important to be consistent and predictable and barring the most unusual circumstances, my syllabus is written such that I can point students to it to let them know what policy applies to their situation. 

I'm not even mad at the students. Honestly, they're just trying to get by doing as little as possible. I'm just so frustrated that I work in an environment where leaders acknowledge that those who enforce their policies with students systematically get lower ratings and yet they still use it as one of their primary metrics for evaluating performance. I feel disheartened that my teaching ""only"" being considers ""good""-to-""very good"" is going to hurt my chances for tenure. 

Tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

Rant. Over. 

Edit: took out comment about gaming the system and handing out As because too many people took it too literally. It's a rant, though advice would still be appreciated.

In the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.

By Rose Horowitch

During their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard‚Äôs faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.

They were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.

Last year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students‚Äô grades are up, but they‚Äôre doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. ‚ÄúA majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,‚Äù the committee wrote.

And yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A‚Äôs are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.

Of course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. And now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it‚Äôs confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren‚Äôt so urgent: Can the world‚Äôs top universities get their students to care about learning?



The road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. These overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A‚Äì, became a not-uncommon occurrence.

At the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students‚Äô emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard‚Äôs dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who‚Äôd matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A‚Äì. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.

The pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020‚Äì21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.

Taken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student‚Äôs work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A‚Äôs for excellent work. Others get the mark because they‚Äôre from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. And still others get A‚Äôs because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. ‚ÄúSo pretty much everyone gets A‚Äôs,‚Äù Claybaugh told me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we‚Äôve ended up.‚Äù

Without the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A‚Äôs. An incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don‚Äôt read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. ‚ÄúI feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,‚Äù Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. ‚ÄúThis is the place where we‚Äôre supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.‚Äù

That easy A‚Äôs would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What‚Äôs genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn‚Äôt until I graduated that I, like Harvard‚Äôs professors and administrators, came to see these issues‚Äîlax grading, high stress‚Äîas connected.

When everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They‚Äôve spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. Getting all A‚Äôs is necessary, but insufficient.

This has created what Claybaugh called a ‚Äúshadow system of distinction.‚Äù Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They‚Äôve created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit r√©sum√©s, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn‚Äôt considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. ‚ÄúThere are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúEven volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They‚Äôre highly competitive.‚Äù Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.

Max Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn‚Äôt prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one‚Äôs own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.

This hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.



Now that they know that making college easier doesn‚Äôt reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students‚Äô frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.

Fixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A‚Äôs that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses‚Äô median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.


Claybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. ‚ÄúIf we have the world‚Äôs biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,‚Äù Claybaugh told me. ‚ÄúAnd if the students we‚Äôre admitting don‚Äôt want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.‚Äù

If Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration‚Äôs assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university‚Äôs public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. ‚ÄúWe should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people‚Äôs eyes,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people all across America thinking, It‚Äôs a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.‚Äù",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1n2q30o/the_atlantic_the_perverse_consequences_of_the/

**Here's the deal:** I want to dive deep into Computer Science, way beyond what most people do. Sure, I might not end up implementing the latest AI in some groundbreaking game, but that's not the only endgame here. The Ph.D. is about gaining a level of expertise and problem-solving skills that you just can't get elsewhere.  
  
**I'm not deluding myself** ‚Äì I know it's going to be tough as hell. Long hours, potential burnout, and the ever-present ""is this worth it?"" question. But here's my take: even if I don't end up working on the bleeding edge, I'll have a toolkit that lets me approach game development (or any software development) from angles most people don't even know exist.  
  
Am I worried about the job market? Hell yes. Am I concerned about the opportunity cost? Absolutely. But I'm also excited about the chance to push myself to my intellectual limits and see what I'm really capable of.  
  
So yeah, I'm going into this with my eyes wide open. It's not for everyone, and it might not be the golden ticket to my dream job. But for me, right now, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. And if I change my mind halfway through? Well, that's a bridge I'll cross when I come to it.

Because of this, I have but one real question for Ph.D. Students out there: **How has your Ph.D. experience helped you develop skills that you believe will be valuable in your future career?**

d15361,"Not a freeway flyer anymore, and it feels GREAT!","For the last EIGHT years, I have taught at anywhere from two to four college campuses per year, picking up whatever courses they would throw at me, often six or seven per semester. One semester, I taught 7 courses, all 7 different preps, spanning THREE different disciplines (Composition, ESL, Linguistics) at THREE different campuses, ***each in a different county***, all in the same semester. And then I would teach 6-12 units every summer. No rest for the wicked.

I was too often late getting essays graded, and usually by about the 8 or 9 week mark, I would be feeling completely drained. My health suffered. My car depreciated (~25K miles per year on average). I began to envision life forever as a bought-and-paid-for member of the ever-loyal-but-never-valued contingent labor brigade. Over the last 8 years or so, I think I only cracked $50K in gross earnings once, maybe twice. And then only just barely. But what else could I do? I have no marketable skills, save my better-than-average mind and what seems to be a knack for teaching. Besides, teaching is all I've done since 1992; it's what I love.

So after years of applying for full-time positions (TT positions at local community colleges, as well as full-time non-instructional positions like Writing Center Director and ESOL Coordinator) and getting nowhere (4-5 interviews, 2 second round, only 1 final round), and after years of FRIGHTENING declines in enrollment (20-30% drop at my main institution in recent years, ENGL has lost nearly half its adjuncts, they're threatening full-time TT faculty position retrenchments within 2 years if trends do not change) and too many scary, and expensive, course cancellations, I finally went back to teaching high school full time.  My salary instantly jumped $15K+, and I know I am not getting any of my classes cancelled. And benefits. Sick days, Family days. A *really* strong union.

However, I still need money to get out of some of the the debt that my years as a freeway-flying adjunct put me into, so I still teach college in the evenings. And besides, I still love it -- I'm not ready to give it up. I still teach at my main institution, my 9th year with this really great little community college, in a super department with a really supportive chair. I teach a 6-unit ALP cohort (freshman comp paired with a developmental comp) two nights a week, ~20 students. 

With only 20 students, I am SOOOO much more able to stay on top of things, plan, grade, keep in touch with students, etc... I feel less pressure, and almost no stress. I have extra time on my hands, at least, a lot more than I ever did. (Yes, teaching high school is a lot of work, but my HS schedule has a lot of built-in prep time each day.) My college students will benefit from this. And I'm making ~$32,000 a year more than I ever did as an adjunct (my HS salary bump, plus 6 units at my CC per semester), and I feel GREAT!!!

Only 2 weeks into the new year, but I am optimistic for the first time in years. Am I pissed that I never got that TT teaching gig at my CC? Yeah, kind of. I still feel the sting of failure, even though I know [it probably wasn't personal](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Didnt-They-Pick-Me-/151391?cid=cp76). I would have been great.

However, I've been feeling very very tired lately; unable to function, really. And I started to look back at how much I've done in the past 8 months without taking a longer break: I've written a couple dissertation chapters, a couple conference papers which I've presented, a paper and a book chapter. I'm exhausted. I realised I desperately need a summer break - so that's what I'm doing! I'm giving myself a full week of rest. 

I encourage you all to also take longer breaks and do not believe that taking weekends off, or taking a couple days off here and there, means you don't deserve to give your brain more time to actually reset. You're not a machine.

1gqrkcq,Are PhD years 4 and forward depressing for everyone?,"I'm at the beginning of my 4th year in bioengineering. and long story short: I'm just tired. I'm tired of school shit. of academia in general. 

School was a place I loved, and I started a PhD to finally become a PI, do my own research, and be surrounded by a young, curious generation. But doing a PhD and seeing this system inside out has destroyed all my dreams for the future. I no longer want to step into school, let alone become a PI.

But you know, in general, I'm tired of how the world works. Everyone is pretending to want to solve the problems, while they don't. Some basic things are still unknown and no one cares about that. They try to hide their protocols and boast about their results. The least and last thing they think about is a motive to solve an issue. 

So I don't know what I want to be in the future. I'm lost. I was just talking to my PI, and she was telling me it's normal to experience more burnout and mental exhaustion in 4th and 5th year and she has gone through it too. She is super nice by the way and is very supportive. 

  
so I'm just here to ask people who are either already in these years, or have passed this time, is it so? does everyone feel so tired in 4th year? and if you still are in the academy, what made you decide so, despite these issues? also, is the industry any better?

1j11j2w,My $24k Scholarship Might Have Ruined My Life,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 19-year-old college sophomore currently majoring in Chemical Engineering, and I'm really at a crossroads right now. I'm making this post after failing my physics midterm (still have C in the overall course), so I might not be thinking straight but I'm on the verge of dropping out. This semester has been a nightmare. Sorry for the length.

A little backstory, I got an almost full ride (full tuition for 4yrs, a year of free housing, and an additional $500 a semester) along with an outside scholarship that gives $3000 a semester as long as I stick with engineering. However, a dangerous roommate situation severely impacted my GPA and academic performance, nearly causing me to lose these. I was put on probation last semester, I got a 3.2 GPA after being on probation (and moving to a studio), but this semester my grades have tanked to around 1.25 (A in one class, F in 2 others). I've been struggling with everything from a daily 8AM in-person lecture (after biking 7-15 minutes in cold, even rainy/snowy weather), extreme burnout, undiagnosed mental health issue(s) that I've struggled with since middle school that have only gotten worse in college, I can't speak to people normally, insomnia (but for some reason I fall asleep if I attempt to seriously study), poor financial management (last semester I only ate one meal a day but now I have to eat like 2-3 or else I feel hungry but rent is almost $2000/month and I don't have a job or car).

Since I've already been on probation I doubt they'll give me another chance if this semester tanks. I'm starting to seriously question whether I should stick with engineering or switch majors, or even consider leaving college altogether. I'm grateful for the 24k engr scholarship, but I despise it at the same time. I passed Calc and Chemistry, and I've never struggled in a Biology class, so I should've just majored in that. I was top of my class when I did a CNA program at a tech college during high school. The risk outweighed the reward and now my GPA's about to be in hell, and I won't even be able to get federal aid. I hate ChemE major so much.

The work is hard and requires a level of thinking and processing time that just isn't suited for me. It's not that I don't get the concepts but it takes me too long to learn them, so I always end up behind. Then I feel stupid after the tests have passed because of how I missed questions that I can now easily comprehend. I hate the way my professors look at me when I ask a question, like they can't understand the words that are coming out of my mouth that sounded so clear in my brain. I hate being ignored by professors when I reach out to them in emails. I hate how these motherfuckers act so superior to people just because they're a professor.

I‚Äôve been looking into certificate programs (like dental lab tech or pharmacy tech) because I want a job with a stable, repetitive routine where I don‚Äôt have to deal with the chaos of customer service or constantly shifting responsibilities. Ideally, I‚Äôd love a role where I can work semi-independently and eventually afford my own small place (like a one bedroom/studio) in a safe neighborhood, with enough to cover healthy food (I‚Äôm tired of having to eat junk cause it‚Äôs more affordable). I don‚Äôt want a 6 figure income or to travel constantly or have a whole bunch of clothes and tech, etc. I just want the basics and to be safe and away from my family.

I‚Äôm also considering trying to land an online job, even though my work history is limited to a few customer service positions (the longest being 6 months). I‚Äôm not sure if companies would consider me seriously given my age and the fact I‚Äôve mostly done customer service. If anyone has experience or advice on how to present myself for online roles‚Äîor what sites are best for finding such jobs‚ÄîI‚Äôd really appreciate your input.

TL;DR: Should I try to switch majors and keep pushing through college, or is it better to consider alternative career paths like a certificate program or online work, even if it means facing some judgment from others? How can I best set myself up for stability and independence given where I am right now?

1mcr11c,Masters? Math minor? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!,"Hello all,

I'm a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science at my university, and I'm at a crossroads with my academic plans. Quick backstory: My freshman year was a disaster‚ÄîI partied way too much, barely scraped by in my classes, and ended up with a GPA that I'm not proud of. I've since turned things around, putting my head down to focus on studying and rebuilding my habits. This turnaround has me motivated to set ambitious goals, like proving to myself that I can excel academically, make a strong comeback, and that I belong in my school/the cs field in general.

My school offers a combined BS/MS program in CS, where I could finish my bachelor's by the end of junior year and spend senior year taking grad-level classes to earn a master's. It's competitive (applications due by the start of senior year), but it feels like a perfect challenge to push myself and my curiosity. That said, I'm wondering if it's truly worth the effort for my career. I'm interested in doing extensive research in the CS field, but would a master's give me any edge in job hunting, especially for entry-level software engineering roles? I know hiring really comes down to your programming skills, problem-solving ability, and projects/internships, but I figure the advanced coursework could sharpen those skills and make me stand out. Or am I overvaluing it? Should I just focus on a solid bachelor's and real-world experience instead?

On top of that, I'm tempted to minor in mathematics. I've always enjoyed math (I knocked out Calc III and Linear Algebra freshman year, despite the chaos), and from what I've read in other threads, higher-level math courses can build ""abstract thinking"" skills that pay off big in CS careers or even just help approaching problems more creatively in the long run. But adding the minor would make my schedule pretty brutal, pushing me to 16-19 credits per semester, especially if I pursue the combined program.

Chasing both seems like a burnout speedrun, and while I'm committed to working hard, I don't want to sacrifice every free hour of college to homework and studying. I still value balance, social life, and good mental health. Should I prioritize the BS/MS program as my ""redemption goal,"" or go for the bachelor's with a math minor for those broader skills? Or maybe neither, and just build a strong portfolio/internships? Any advice from folks who've been through similar paths, especially with combined programs or math minors in CS, would be hugely appreciated.

1h516zj,What is this addition and subtraction you speak of?? (overall course grade calculations),"I learned years ago that weighted averages are way, way too hard for my freshmen to calculate. I teach a quantitative course that assumes you know how to take averages, so my (former) go-to when students asked about their overall grade was to tell them to calculate it themselves using the weights in the syllabus, making sure to average by category. Yeaaah, that worked until 2022 or so when sudents stopped being able to take averages, even when I provided them the formula.

So I thought--they should be able to *add*, right? So I switched my system to the popular ""you can earn up to 1000 points"" system. 1000 is a nice number, it's easy to see what your grade is, just move the decimal point two places to the left after adding up all your points. I set up my LMS to do that for students. You'd think there would be no more ""what is my grade right now and what is the highest grade I can get in this class given the little work I've done so far"" emails, right? Hahahahaha *you would be wrong!!!* 

I let students ignore one bad exam grade and move its max possible points to the final. Eh, people have bad weeks/months. The final is comprehensive so they have to learn the content anyway. But without fail students are absolutely *mystified* by what moving the points to the final entails. I tell them it means the final will be worth X + Y points instead of X points. And then I get students who missed an exam and thus have no points from it and have elected to move the points from that exam to the final, sending me emails like, ""Is there any way I can possibly pass this class? The LMS says my grade right now is a 50% üò¢ "" 

These are students who *know that their final is worth a huge chunk* of their overall grade because they *already chose* to move the points from one exam onto the final (like, they reached out to me weeks ago to move those points). The points values of everything are made extremely clear both on the LMS, on the syllabus, etc etc. These are students who could easily get high Bs if they earn max points on the final, asking me if it's possible for them to pass the class. Can freshmen not even add anymore?

I'm so tired of this learned helplessness and the utter waste of my time from all these ""Just to confirm that.... INSERT THING THAT IS CLEARLY PRINTED ON THE SYLLABUS HERE"" and ""Can I possibly pass the class please tell me I can't do basic addition"" and other learned helplessness/risk-averse time-wasting garbage. I can't wait until we get AI assistants in higher ed that can act as reassurance modules for hyper-anxious innumerate students, because I swear a good 40% of my email interactions are mitigating these issues.

Have you noticed the bottom dropping out like I have? I used to complain in 2021/2/3 that students were regressing to the intellectual maturity of middle-schoolers. I *wish* that were still the case.

1h88dkz,How do you deal with students who want to negotiate grades?,"I've been teaching for over 10 years and in the last few years I've seen a massive increase in students who want to argue over exam grades. It's gotten to the point that as soon as I return exams, at the end of class, I have at least 20 students lined up wanting to argue for a grade change (out of a class of 180). I teach STEM so my exams are mathematics-based. It is not subjective. We give partial credit throughout, 100 points are divided into 1-5 points per aspect in a problem and we do not carry forward cascading errors. There is a rubric we grade to and I do not provide the solutions because students have uploaded them to Chegg. Exam grades are high on average due to the structure and grading format (in the B+ range).

It gets super uncomfortable on exam return days. I tell the students why their answers are incorrect in a public space which is uncomfortable. They argue for more points without having taken the time to review what they did wrong. They don't take no for an answer until I repeat myself 3 times. They leave frustrated. This repeats for every student in the line until I am emotionally exhausted, and a bit angry, and it shows on my face. Last semester, this was reflected in my evaluations. ""condescending"", ""fake nice"", etc.

This semester, I told the students as they lined up that going over their exams instantly (like some sort of grading robot who stores the solutions and grading rubric in my mental RAM) and in public was uncomfortable for me. I asked them to take a picture of the problem in-question, return the physical to me, and email me their questions. It has made things better but now my inbox is full.

How do you all deal with grade grubbing? Do you allow it? I am considering making a rule that grades are non-negotiable and just saying no moving forward.

1ludy7n,20/20 Reasons Every Medical Student should consider Ophthalmology,"**Intro:** I'm a current ophthalmology resident in the US and wanted to share some in**sight** (pun-intended) into why everyone should consider ophthalmology as a potential field.

**My backstory:** I too, like many others, thought that eyeballs were disgusting and that ophthalmology was one of the most boring fields in medicine. I mean, why would any sane person spend 4 years studying body medicine just to throw away all that knowledge to focus on diseases of the two balls of jelly in the sockets of my skull that a seasoned optometrist can handle right? I came into medical school knowing I wanted to be a cardiologist 100%, no doubt. In fact that's what I did my college research on.

At first, ophthalmology wasn‚Äôt even on the radar. In need of shadowing hours to apply to medical school, the only available opportunity came from a local comprehensive ophthalmologist. The experience, admittedly, didn‚Äôt make a strong first impression ‚Äî it felt routine, even dull. But that exposure quietly planted a seed. Over time, it became clear that ophthalmology offered a rare combination: the ability to make direct, tangible impact, engage in precise hands-on procedures, and maintain a balanced lifestyle. Once in medical school, the appeal only deepened ‚Äî and the path forward became undeniable.

**Why ophthalmology?**

**1. ¬øPor qu√© no los dos? (Why not both?)**

How many of you heard the advice ""First decide between surgical or non-surgical"" when choosing a specialty. Well, if you truly hate surgery you can stop reading now because ophthalmology is a surgical field no matter how you see it (and while it's true that neuro-ophth or ophtho oncology may be less surgical, you still have to go through surgical training per the ACGME in residency).

What about people who want both medicine and surgery? Great news! In ophthalmology you can have both. Actually, you get 3 categories of care: Outpatient clinic, surgery in the OR, and procedures in-office. If you love variety or want variety in your schedule, ophthalmology may be a great fit for you. Imagine clocking into the same clinic 8 AM - 5 PM every single day for 30 years. Now imagine on Monday - Wednesday you see clinic patients and do some in-house procedures, Thursday you operate, and Friday you work a half day to see post-ops and go home by 1 PM with your entire weekend off? If the latter sounds like something you would like, it's possible in ophthalmology.

OBGYN, urology, and ENT also offer the same perks of being a hybrid specialty but at the cost of a longer residency, worse hours, and/or more emergencies.

**2. The need for eye care is increasing**

Every one reading this will develop cataracts eventually unless you die before they form. Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are no where near controlled in America, all of which are risk factors for devastating eye pathologies that require ophthalmic care and even surgery in some instances unless you want to become permanently blind. Every July 4th, some poor unfortunate soul gets shot in the eye with a firework and needs immediate attention.

America's population is aging. And don't even get me started on the large need of eye care and cataract surgery for countries outside of the U.S.A. Everybody eventually is going to need to see an ophthalmologist. The demand for trained eye specialists is not declining any time soon, especially given the fact that 99% of physicians don't know how to treat eye pathologies period.

**3. The art of the physical exam**

Ophthalmology is one of the few specialties where the physical exam matters before you even get imaging or diagnostic studies. It requires finesse, skill, and the ability to use both hands and your brain simultaneously.

You are analyzing parts of the eyes as thick as couple microns and sometimes evaluating the presence of red blood cells with your own eyes. You can even diagnose a patient without a proper history because you can often see the diagnosis yourself.  For those who appreciate technical skill, the tradition of the physical exam, and the ability to see literal blood vessels, nerves, and microtrauma with your own eyes, you will find ophthalmology to be a truly captivating field.

**4. You are a specialty consult service and can do many things in-house**

I personally see this as a pro because ophthalmology is rarely the primary team, if ever. You are consulted for your help and then you get to dip out of there. Long gone are those long-winded stories about how grandma baked brownies for her granddaughter's sweet sixteen after you asked the simple question of whether she still takes her Lisinopril.

Visits are often more straightforward, focused, and efficient than primary care clinic or internal medicine rounds. Ophthalmologists have access to their own procedure suites and imaging units (OCT, Ultrasounds, Laser rooms, injections). If your patient needs something, simply send them down the hall to get it ASAP. Compare that to some of your IM folks who have to place the order for an MRI, then things get lost in translation or the radiologist doesn't provide the impression in time, etc.

Which brings me to my next point

**5. You are the clinician, the surgeon, AND the radiologist for your patient all at once.**

Ophthalmologist not only treat diseases medically and procedurally and surgically, but they also diagnose and evaluate through imaging. From photos of the back of your eye, to cross-sections of the layers of your retina, to ultrasounds of your eyeballs, ophthalmologists can perform, read, **and** interpret their own imaging without the need for a radiologist.

**6. Lifestyle and Job Satisfaction**

It's no secret that ophthalmology is a ROAD specialty and grants a balance of lifestyle, salary, and job [satisfaction. ](https://www.aao.org/education/headline/high-career-satisfaction-rates-among-ophthalmologi)Ophthalmologists are routinely rated as one of the happiest physicians and would choose both medicine AND ophthalmology again if they went back in time. Rates of burnout are low. They spend one of the [least amount of time charting](https://www.beckersasc.com/uncategorized/the-specialties-spending-the-most-least-time-on-paperwork/), especially if they have a personal loyal scribe Jonathan.

If you like the idea of being able to manage diseases medically and surgically while still maintaining a good lifestyle, ophthalmology should be near or at the top of your potential specialties of interest.

Oh, did I mention ophthalmology residency is **4 years.** Technically 3 years because 1 year is IM. This is one of the best deals in medicine.

**7. Fellowship is OPTIONAL and there's something for everyone.**

Not only is residency only 4 years, but fellowship is TRULY OPTIONAL. Some of the highest earners and happiest doctors are comprehensive ophthalmologists who do cataract and refractive (LASIK/PRK/SMILE) surgery which doesn't require a fellowship.

If you do fancy a fellowship, there are a TON of options: Cornea/Refractive, Glaucoma, Medical and Surgical Retina, Oculoplastics, Neuro-ophthalmology, Pediatrics, and more niche fields such as Uveitis and Ocular Oncology.

Want a high stakes, fast-paced specialty within ophtho? Surgical retina is great

Enjoy more of the refractive, quality of life improvement side of ophtho? Refractive and cataract surgery is a great option

Like the more medical side of ophthalmology? Neuro-ophtho and/or Uveitis fits that bill

Realized you don't like the eyeballs that much but enjoy the structures around the eye? Oculoplastics has you covered.

**8. Quality of life improvement**

Going blind is one of the top fears in America.

This goes without saying but cataract surgery allows you to quite literally cure blindness in 15 minutes. LASIK can rid somebody of glasses or contacts for decades, allowing them to wake up with 20/20, play sports without corrective lenses, save money from buying contact lenses, and reduce the risk of contact lens induced infections (there are many articles that indicate that the rates of complications and infection from wearing contact lenses are higher than that of refractive laser surgery).

Some patients will go blind forever after a retinal detachment for instance. Only an ophthalmologist can go into the eyeball and re-attach your retina back in your eyeball and preserve your vision.

You think transplant surgery is only for transplant surgeons? Well good news, ophthalmologists can transplant corneas from one person to another.

Some babies are born with congenital defects and cataracts which can make them amblyopic for life. Imagine living your entire life seeing double? Great news, an ophthalmologist can fix that issue before it becomes a permanent issue.

From a newborn to a 100 year old patient, ophthalmologists can care for a wide range of patients and provide immense quality of life improvements.

**9. The technology is rapidly evolving**

If you like technology and innovation, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for it. Ophthalmology is a field rooted in technology, lenses, physics, optics, lasers, imaging modalities, robotics, microsurgical tools, etc. People are incorporating AI to help diagnose ophthalmic disease and screen for glaucoma. Lens technology is improving every year so that patients who undergo cataract surgery can become less dependent on glasses with reduced side effects from the surgery. The potential is endless and ophthalmology attracts many people who have backgrounds in CS, engineering, and even architecture.

**10. One of the best fields for global outreach**

If you enjoy helping those in need outside of the USA or perhaps have a religious background and want to use your skills to help the less fortunate outside the US borders, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for that. The prevalence of infections and need for routine cataract surgery is immense across the globe and ophthalmology provides opportunities to do high-impact surgeries and medical treatments for those who need eye care.  Ophthalmology even has a literal [flying eye hospital](https://www.orbis.org/en/what-we-do/flying-eye-hospital) inside of a plane.

**Common Misconceptions and Responses:**

**1. ""I don't want to sit there going ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" all day long.**

Most ophthalmologists do not refract their own patients like this routinely and even if they did, it does not take up majority of their day. Our main job is not to prescribe glasses. It's to diagnose and manage eye disease. If you think this is what ophthalmologists do all day, this is a severe miscategorization

**2. ""What a waste of medical school to just focus on eyeballs"".**

Ophthalmology is deeply interdisciplinary, and many cases require knowledge across **general medicine, neurology, rheumatology, dermatology, infectious disease, and more.**

For instance, **diabetic retinopathy r**equires understanding systemic diabetes control and knowing how to educate patients on the importance of A1c control in relation to their eye health.

**Thyroid Eye Disease r**equires collaboration with endocrinology for managing thyroid dysfunction and orbital disease.

**CN III, IV, VI palsies r**equire full **neuro exams, stroke risk evaluation**, and sometimes urgent **neuroimaging.**

**Uveitis** can be caused by systemic diseases like **sarcoidosis, HLA-B27 diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis), Beh√ßet's, lupus** and requires knowing relevant labs i.e ANA, RF, HLA-B27, ACE, etc.)

**Herpes Zoster** can affect not just your skin (derm) but also your eyes.

**CMV retinitis** is common in patients with low CD4 counts (AIDS) and requires knowing how to collaborate with doctors who provide antiretroviral therapies.

**Artery occlusions of the eye** require stroke workup, carotid US, possible echocardiograms, understanding of hyper-coagulability such as in the case of antiphospholipid syndrome, malignancy, etc.

A good ophthalmologist must have the underlying fundamentals of medicine and multiple specialties to evaluate systemic causes of ocular disease and more effectively coordinate and understand the plans of other physicians that might be taking care of the same patient.

**3. Surgery on eyeballs sounds disgusting**

While I can't convince everybody that ocular surgery isn't as bad as it looks (because even I'll admit some eye disease and surgeries look really gnarly), please note that ophthalmic surgery is highly controlled, precise, and requires extreme finesse and steady hands. Ophthalmologists are working inside a tiny capsule in your eyeball to remove a cataract or sometimes peeling off literal layers of your retina. It takes hours of practice and technique to master ophthalmic surgery and is done in a clean, precise manner with anesthesia. No we don't get a knife and slice down the cornea and rip open your eye. No we don't scoop out people's eyeballs with a ice cream scooper in clinic. No we don't inject needles through your pupil.

**4. Optometry scope creep**

I'll just say that majority of optometrists do not want to do surgery and even if they did, they do not have the medical expertise to both perform surgery or to manage any of the complications from surgery and thus should not even be allowed to cut the eyeball period. Optometrists and ophthalmologists have a pretty good relationship and often work TOGETHER to refer and manage patients as a team. And NPs and PAs typically don't fight for any ophthalmology rights, at least none to my knowledge.

At the end of the day, people are going to flock to a trained ophthalmologist when it comes down to severe eye disease, surgical referrals, and trauma. So no, that optometrist at your local optical shop is not going to replace us in 10 years.

**Final words for upcoming and current med students:** Just take a chance and learn more about ophthalmology or shadow. Consider things you want in a specialty and whether it caters to your strengths and life values/goals.

Ophthalmology is competitive. It's been hovering around a 65-69% ish match rate with no signs of it becoming less competitive. However, it's competitive for a reason clearly. Study hard, shadow, be open to any learning opportunity. Even if you don't end up deciding on ophthalmology, I hope that the main takeaway here is to not knock it til you try it.

1axok5q,First-year doctoral student- distressed and not sure if I can make it,"Hi everyone, I need to vent/express myself for a bit, and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and share their thoughts.

I was really excited for grad school. I think my advisor saw this, too, and we hit it off when I interviewed up to when I started in August. I sensed she was going to be tough on me, but I considered myself strong and disciplined, plus everyone supporting me said I had the work ethic to be a grad student. 

Fast forward to now, about a third of the way through my second semester. I've been crying just about every night for the past week or so. Mainly, it's isolation, but its also a loss in my sense of self, because I am NOT performing well here. At least, this is the feedback I've received from my advisor. I've been too busy to spend time with my peers to see if this is really the case, or if my advisor is being hard on me, and I am doing fine.

I am in 15 credit hours of classes. 1 hour is a 'pleasure class' which is easy. The other 14 were suggested by my advisor, and I am not allowed to drop. They aren't horribly bad, but it is just a lot of hours. One of the classes is taught my my advisor herself, and this is the most time consuming class of the bunch. I currently have a C in that class, and an A in the others. In a meeting with my advisor, I suggested an independent study to replace one of my classes and make it easier on me, but my advisor laughed and said I didn't work hard enough last semester to deserve a break like that.

I started a GRA this semester, expecting it to be a lighter load than GTA, which it is not. My advisor is requiring 20 hours a week of lab work, and since I am a first year, none of the samples I am working with are mine. I am not allowed to start processing my own samples or counting my lab hours towards personal research because my advisor is not satisfied with the research questions I have yet. To be fair, my research is not doing well, but I feel like if I had more time to dedicate to it (as opposed to 15 hours of classes + 20 hours of work), I could achieve this.

I have an office but I only ever use it for storage, because if I'm not in class, I'm working in the lab. I go home at 6 or 7 most days, cook food, shower, play with my dog, and then start crying, usually. I know I should be using this time to work on my research so I can finally make some progress and have a shot at graduating eventually, but all I want to do is go to bed. I am not even that sleep-deprived, I just can't cope with the thought of mentally exerting myself all day long. 

I receive passive-aggressive texts from my advisor or my lab manager often. Usually every other day.  And I think they talk behind my back, because I will notice they will allude to things that they weren't there to see, so they must have heard about it from each other. I don't think this is in my head. I used to admire them, but now I feel tense around them. They monitor my hours in the lab closely and have expressed annoyance at weeks where I am only able to complete 18-19 hours of lab work, rather than the full 20.

I don't know what to do. I'm enrolled in therapy at my university, I am eating well and sleeping enough. I do not have friends to spend time with, and departmental social events don't usually work with my schedule. I called my mom today to ask her what she thinks about me moving home.

I just know if I give up, I will not stop thinking about research. This was my dream, I made it, and I feel like it's changing me, and not in a good way, and I do not feel comfortable here. I regret not picking the other school that made me an offer. I wonder if I drop here, if the other school would take me, or if my chance at a masters or doctoral degree is gone.

277v9w,What do you do when you get in a rut?,"I'm a twenty something male working on my PhD in a scientific topic where my goal is to spend all my day sitting alone working on my research.

Lately I've been stuck in a rut of sorts.  At the beginning of the year, I broke up with my (now) ex fianc√© and I felt horrible.  I don't feel horrible now, I really feel quite great romantically (I've been dating new people, etc...), and yet I feel the feeling of going to work and doing nothing has followed me into the months since my breakup.

It's the 3rd year of my PhD, and so I essentially mostly work alone.  I've been working on a paper, but to be honest, I have lost the spark about my topic.  I feel my current paper is not useful and don't know how to properly differentiate it from other work in the area.  My advisor is understanding and I do some work, but I've lost the passion I once had.  I have a real problem getting motivated and working all day like I used to, because it's a really demanding field, and I don't know how to wake up and just do it myself without having small defined tasks to do (or even what those tasks are).

So right now it feels like the steps are ""step one, find genius idea, step two execute genius idea.""  It's easy to waste time reading papers and playing around with ideas that go nowhere, but much harder to put pen to paper and work on an idea I no longer feel passionate about, or that I feel isn't useful for humanity.  I know ultimately I should just finish this paper so I can move onto something better, but there's a lot of anxiety that fi I do this, I'll have to work on the next thing, which will be even worse because it will be a follow up to this already lackluster idea.

And as a consequence I put minimal energy into it.  I find myself reading about topics I find truly world changing in an almost pornographic way, as in ""oh wow, if only I were working  on this!"" or ""boy howdy, they are lucky to work on this idea!""  Part of it is my reticence to admit to my advisor that I don't feel like our work is that good anymore, and that I've have to admit I've wasted my semester working on something that isn't that useful.

I feel this is a common problem, but my feeling of anxiety about my work spurs a continued lack of work because I fear I'll be doing nothing, and hence do nothing, which is obviously dumb.  But at this point, starting work seems like ""well there's so much to do I just feel overwhelmed how am I ever going to catch up?""",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/277v9w/what_do_you_do_when_you_get_in_a_rut/
1f5pk04,College as a physically weaker student ,"I think that one aspect of college that can be overlooked is the amount of physical lifting you have to do. I'm a pretty unfit person, and 10 pounds underweight (yeah that's really terrible and definitely a huge factor in this but I'm working on it) and just a naturally weak person. My campus is large, and this semester, my classes are 20 minutes of walking from my dorm. I have to carry my laptop and tablet and some water. It doesn't sound like much but god it absolutely kills my body, especially my back. And when I get physically/ emotionally exhausted, I find little energy left for schoolwork.

So I just bought a new backpack from swiss gear that will hopefully give me more back support, unlike my backpack I had before for my first year that was more for aesthetic purposes. I'm deciding to not carry a large flask for water, but maybe a simpler water bottle. I'm trying to force myself to eat more meals even though eating hurts me sometimes and feels like a chore (another problem I definitely need to sort out). It doesn't help that the only good diner on my campus is a 20+ minute walk away from my dorm, and the diners near mine are either very limited in food choice, lesser to my liking, and/or busy as hell. I do have some food in my dorm and got protein shakes, which will hopefully improve my weight.

I wonder if I should start exercising, although I feel like all the walking and backpack lifting I do is exercise in itself. 

Anyone else have any similar issues? What do you guys do to manage carrying items and long walks on campus?

edit: Obviously, for now, before I ever go to the gym- I HAVE to work on gaining weight lol, if I went to the gym right now with my weight and diet I‚Äôd probably accidentally die or something tbh

1mwzv6b,Changing fields: Better to drop current PhD or do a second PhD,"I'm in the second year of a PhD in subject A and I wish to build a career in subject B instead. I only chose to go into subject A because I was having a mental health crisis and not thinking clearly (I became convinced that I could effortlessly succeed in subject A but that subject B was beyond my capabilities intellectually). When I managed to heal from that, I realised that I sacrificed my decade long dream of pursuing subject B for no real reason, and instead am stuck pursuing subject A which I have no real interest in. My plan all along was to ""quickly and easily"" get tenure in A and immediately switch to B, there was never a moment of actually genuinely wanting to study subject A for the long haul. In contrast, if you told me 100% that I would never get a professorship in subject B, I would still want to do a PhD in B just to have that experience in my life of being able to engage with research in it and to experience being surrounded by other people who love the thing I love most in my life.

In similar situations people often suggest trying to publish research in A and incrementally move towards doing research in B. When these subjects are closely related, I think that is feasible. However, in my case subject B is a very abstract area of pure mathematics, and subject A is a very applied non-mathematical subject, so I don't think this is feasible. I don't know that there is an audience to even publish such papers for were I able to think them up.

Hence, it appears to me that there are only two courses of action to choose between:

1. Drop out of this PhD program and try to apply to program in B.

2. Complete this PhD and then try to apply to do a second PhD in B.

My concern with (1) is that it feels very risky to throw away a stable income source and to have the red flag of dropping out of a PhD on my next application. My concern with (2) is that the sentiment against doing a second PhD seems strong online, and I worry whether funding agencies would even approve me getting a scholarship to do a second PhD (my family is not rich).

I would love to hear advice on how to best manage this move back to aligning my career with my actual research passion, and I would really love to hear advice from someone who started a PhD in the wrong field and then successfully moved into a different field.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mwzv6b/changing_fields_better_to_drop_current_phd_or_do/
1ljoczm,I really hate software engineering.,"After months and months of applying, I managed to land my first software engineering internship. I started out my first day getting introduced to the office and people I will be working with.

On the last day of the week, we wrapped up the introductions, me and all the other interns were getting a list of tasks and different things to study at home and catch up on. Now none of the tasks had deadlines so I assumed the deadline was the end of the week. So, I leisured away and really took my time. Having barely finished 1/4th of my tasks. I pull up to the first day of Week 2. And all my fellow interns not only finished their tasks, but did extra stuff too, I was shocked and embarrassed. I felt like I was naked in a room full of people, and to make it worse we had a surprise meeting with our supervisor to catch up on us.

I can't describe the amount of humiliation I had felt during the meeting when my supervisor asked me to stay after everyone left and asked me if I was serious about this.

As the days went by, the tasks only got harder and harder, and I feel really stressed about under-delivering. I can't muster the strength to work properly on anything, and procrastination eats my whole day. I feel useless, none of the ambition I used to have stuck with me and I feel like I was daydreaming the whole time, if this is what a software engineering job looks like, then my future is fucked, and I don't want none of it.

I had talked with a co-intern who I managed to befriend, and he was saying to me how he was having a completely different experience. That he's having so much fun and feels like ""he's in his element"". Does this mean that computer science is not for me? Or hell, any kind of job?

18ipc2w,Something needs to change in how we help students with anxiety/ burn out.,"Ok, I heard one too many times this term that students were unable to hand in assignments or write tests because they were feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work they had in other classes or that they are too anxious to get the work done.  I get it, it's a lot. I know mental health is bad. Never in my 5 years of teaching have I had this many students contact me 2 weeks after an assignment was due asking if they could still submit with decrease or no penalty.  It's not fair to students who get it in on time. It's not fair to me.  

I know anxiety makes you procrastinate. But here's the kicker- procrastination and avoidance makes anxiety worse!  So we are actively increasing anxiety by giving extensions.  

So when do we put it back on the student to drop a course rather than bend over backwards and into pretzels handing out extensions?

1j8k97w,College and life is so hard,"So I began going back to college recently but it has been stressing me out so much. I'm going in for a degree in Engineering or at least something i enjoy doing.


My parents were in the military and my mom is Native American which has allowed me to go to college for free which Im aware not many people get that kind of opportunity.
Im taking Math (Algebra), English, and Engineering because I wanna become an engineer some day. It's been two years since I've taken a math class but it's been so stressful. I failed my math exam with a 9/100 which is just sad. Never in my life have I failed a math class so badly even when I struggled, I still managed to pass but this was just awful. It doesn't help that I've been stressing so much lately and I'm dealing with so much at once. My mother passed away back in November (on veterans day...) which motivated me into going to college. But I'm having to deal with college and a billion other things. I work a 12hr/3-4 days a week at Tesla. I've had to work overtime a lot lately because I'm struggling on money. I had to pay my roommate back because I borrowed too much from him which at least that was all finally taken care of but still caused me stress. And then there's my mom's bank I have to take care of, the VA, putting things into my name like insurance (since she had it under her name before). And then moving out of my apartment because the assholes at the office decided to park a stupid golf cart in front of my garage door causing me to park my vehicle in a different spot and not even a day later, it got towed (which technically was the office's fault even though I contacted them, no response). I had to pay 300 bucks to the towing company which was bs. Thats not even counting the dozen other things our apartment is screwing us over for (taking 4-5 months to fix a door or an oven for example). So now my roommate and I agreed to moving out because we had it with their games. I'm still not happy my roommate decided to wanna move out but I agreed and understood his view and reasonings but still. I am gonna move in with my uncle and aunt so that may help. So much crap and more I probably haven't mentioned and it's caused me to struggle in college. I'm managing to pass English and Engineering at least but my math class has really gotten bad to the point I'm considering dropping out for the semester and trying again this summer. I have moments were I stress because I cant even concentrate on a single problem or I just freak out and break down crying. Doesn't help the fact my dad's side of the family has had a bad history of heart problems and heart attacks.

My GPA was bad from the beginning, and I've only had one semester in these four and a half years in which all of my class grades were higher than a C. I've been on academic suspension twice, and will be kicked out if my GPA goes below 2.0 again, so that is a constant worry for me.

I stupidly took the advice from my counselor to get all of my core classes out of the way first, and ended up having to retake all of them about two or three times each, as I've either failed or withdrawn from them. At this point, I'm basically done and only have English classes left, but I hate these. I don't know how it is at other places, but here, literature and writing classes are taught by complete idiots (with very few exceptions).

A while ago, I took archaeology and history courses, which I quite liked, and considered changing my major because of them. However, as I've said, I'm a fifth-year senior, and I've already wasted a lot of money on trying to force my way to a bacheolor's degree. In the simplest of terms, I'm just taking the quickest path to graduation. Looking back on my studies, I can honestly say that I have learned nothing of any value as a result of being here.

Employment is under control, I guess, at this point. I recently started a job which doesn't have the best pay, but is quite easy and not exhausting at all. As far as finances go, I'm mostly alright, as I only really spend money on groceries and things necessary for classes/work, now. However, my work history might look weird to other employers; I worked at one job for two months before quitting, then went unemployed for about six months before getting this job (despite applying to over 200 places, I only got these two jobs because of ""quantity-over-quality"" hiring and nepotism, respectively).

According to my list, I only have about five or six more classes to take, but I am completely drained of all motivation to finish. If I do throw in the towel now, I would have wasted a huge amount of money. I know that the money and time is already wasted, since I've spent so much of both on a useless degree, but I've always been told that a bachelor's in and of itself is better than no bachelor's.

I know that if I were to take this sort of opinion to a counselor, they would suggest some option that involves staying in college, so I know that that would be less objective than it would be somewhere like here (maybe). Anyway, I'm extremely burnt out by this, and just want to get some opinions on what I should do.

Tl;dr I hate college but have invested a lot of time and money into a useless degree. I don't think I can graduate, but I don't know if I should stay or drop out.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9p4lgr/i_want_to_drop_out_but_i_dont_think_that_i_can/
1gmlknu,It‚Äôs true what they say that a college degree makes life easier*,"I went back to college in my late 20‚Äôs. Before that, I was working in bars, restaurants, coffee shops, trying to get by through scrounging together a living. I never considered going to college to be a viable option until one day I just got sick of being so purposeless and poor working in a cycle of dead end jobs, so I enrolled in my community college to get a science degree.

Fast forward four years and I‚Äôm finished with my bachelor‚Äôs degree and already have a job making $100k+ a year. I have a really nice apartment, a new car, and a healthy savings account. I have health insurance and stock options. I wake up every morning feeling less stressed and more at ease.

Of course some people have different dreams, but coming from someone who went from not having a degree and to having one, it feels like life with one is significantly easier than without.

2. It's never too early to start an antidepressant or see a counsellor. Look after your mental health, cuz it will suffer

3. You can say 'no' when your program asks too much of you. Take your sick days!

4. Read and know your agreement/contract, and make sure you're paid appropriately

5. Study when you can, rest when you need to. Burnout sucks ballz.

6. It REALLY sucks when you start. A LOT. You'll be in over your head. You'll have imposter syndrome. You'll think there's something you're not thinking of, and there sometimes might be. Trust your knowledge, persist, and help your coresidents. It's a team effort.

196e0hk,I am exhausted.,"This is a bit of a vent to get things off my chest. I apologise for the long post. This is something I have been writing, deleting, and rewriting for some time now. Given that the case is now with the police, I am writing this as anonymously as possible but this is also something I need to write and get off my chest.

I worked hard to graduate from a well-ranked university with more papers than needed, excellent teaching evaluations, and even an award for my research. I had my choice of TT or postdoc positions. I went with a postdoc at with a leader of my field. I was able to help them shape the lab; I was involved in every hiring decision, multiple papers at field-leading venues, and in a number of grants. All was going well until I got my first major grant. ""What?"" you may ask at this point, getting a grant and becoming a PI is a sign of joy.

Just a couple of month after the public announcement of the grant, I got an email from the funding agency: multiple email accounts kept emailing the agency with all sort of accusations about me. Most worrying of them is that I plagiarised my PhD. It felt both bizarre and, yet, scary even if I knew that it was untrue. The so called ‚Äòevidence‚Äô were a collection of random sentences there and here; some 6-7 words definitions (most with a correct citation mind you) and some random statements. If all put together, it would barely account for more than half a page out of a 250+ pages dissertation. Ironically, some of the alleged sources ‚Äòthat I copied from‚Äô and I talk about completely different things in our works (imagine something like I talk about organic chemistry and they talk about gender studies) but it happened that we have the same 6-7 words in similar sentences. Some examples were even from articles released *after* my own dissertation. All too bizarre. Still, someone went throughout my document and, based on their email, googled sentence-by-sentence my entire thesis.

My current dean, chair, and postdoc advisor all went through the allegations and told me how stupid the allegations were. I provided a formal statement to the funding agency and they were satisfied ‚Äîthey even renewed my funding two years after. My alma matter conducted its own investigation and decided that the allegations were unfounded. After all, at my alma matter all doctoral thesis go through TurnitIn at the time of its submission and the committee has to review and sign on any similar text. To my disagreement, they decided not to release a public statement.

However, this is did not go away. The person continued. First by sending emails to people in positions of power at the university, then by emailing random colleagues within and without the university. They even setup a blog with the allegations. They tried to flood the internet, social media, and so on. I had colleagues emailing me directly to express sympathy. Others, emailed my PhD and postdoc advisors‚Äîboth which kept me in the loop‚Äîto express concern, surprise, or some out of a ‚ÄúI need to do something‚Äù feeling.

The advice I got from a lawyer was to ignore it all. This was harder than one thinks, but I tried my best. I ignored them and carried on my work. I was promoted to a research scientist position and managed to get tenured. I got another grant ‚Äîand once again I had to explain to the grant‚Äôs agency that the allegations they got through an anonymous email are untrue.  I continued forward, now with my own lab,  publications at top venues, was asked to serve at various committees, and even unsolicited invited to apply to some TT and tenured positions.

Did all this character assassination damaged my career? Maybe; I had my share of grant rejections since this started ‚Äîa couple with quite vague rational. Maybe not; arguably my career flourished and I even a new job. Yet, I cannot stop thinking that I could have done better if this was not in my mind. I simply cannot know. In some ways, not knowing feels worse to me. It builds a lingering thought of doubt at before every submission and a concern after each rejection. Even when I have positive news, I wonder if I should share them or not. If it will trigger a new round of stalking or not.

I am annoyed; my institution‚Äôs support has been limited to counselling sessions to help me cope and ignore. Our legal department has been completely useless. I have gone to the police; the case is with them but they do not consider this high on their priority list as no direct threats were made.

Spending the past years afraid of celebrating any wins in public made me exhausted and annoyed with the public-facing aspects of the job. We are expected to be ‚Äòperfect‚Äô and even considered ‚Äòpublic figures,‚Äô almost like politicians, but without any of their perks. Coming here on Reddit, I saw posts of colleagues getting really creepy emails from students, stalked, facing similar character assassinations to mine, and even outright sexually harassed by colleagues and students. I sometimes wonder why we bother with our profession. An industry job would have gotten us a bigger pay cheque and probably less exposure to all these crap. Yet, here I am, working 12-14 hours a day, including weekends and holidays.

Tomorrow, I am moving to another institution for a TT position. A bit of a weird move to move to TT from tenured, but my future institution is closer to friends and family, amongst the top of the world for my field, and the position comes a generous starting package to setup a new research focus for the department ‚Äîincluding me hiring new faculty for that. I know that the moment that my move becomes public, the new institution will get the same emails. I rationally know that they will discard it. I know that the person will post again on social media and I rationally know that nothing will come out of that. One of my existing collaborator in the new institution‚Äîa department chair for a different department than my own‚Äìtold me not to care as none will. Yet, I still worry and feel stressed for being able to have a new start.

(I am basically in a field that does not quite match mine, working on something that does not quite match the field. To an extent, it is applicable, but not exactly.)

The thing is that at first my main supervisor told me that we would get funding to pay for the plane tickets. I was quite enthusiastic about it. However, just two weeks ago, my supervisor sent me an email saying that the university decided not to fund me and fund some other national students and one foreign student from a relatively poor country.

In the same email, he wrote that we would get the money from his funding (Not exactly his, I think. The government makes available every year some budget intended for my research.). 

The problem is that I do not have the money to pay for such a plane ticket + other trip expenses. I barely survive in the country on minimum wage as a full-time PhD student. 

Today I kind of hinted to one of my supervisors that maybe I would not be able to pay. He insisted that I will be reimbursed (I forgot to say.. 
Only up to 60%) for the plane tickets and went as far as to tell me that he does not understand what I want for my future since I never want to go overseas (He suggested going for a semester to another place since they do not have that much knowledge on what I do and could not help me much.). 

I think he does not understand it is not that easy in my position. I am on minimum wage and cannot continue asking my folks for money. Enough is enough. He also thinks I am not enthusiastic enough... Nor looking here and there for opportunities... 

However, how could I be? I struggle so much every single day. Can barely get myself to move out from bed. I am tired of the PhD and living abroad. Furthermore, all my problems are aggravated by being isolated in this freaking island.

1625jh5,Female senior doctor saving my surgery rotations.,"I'm currently an M4, and this rotation has easily been the most challenging one I've faced. My responsibilities boiled down to blood drawing, retractor duty in the OR, and feeling invisible during rounds. The attending physician who's supposed to oversee students initially gave the impression of being supportive, but that facade vanished after day one. From then on, he systematically chipped away at my confidence through eye rolls, frustrated sighs, and curt responses whenever I didn't meet his expectations. It felt like he regarded me as a mere secretary, assuming I should know every practical procedure without prior explanation. To make matters worse, he even yelled at me once, blaming me for his workload when a patient declined my care due to my ethnic background.

These past weeks have utterly shattered my confidence. Despite making progress in therapy over the last two years to tackle depression and imposter syndrome, encounters like this trigger a relapse into my self-doubt. I've grown more withdrawn, awkward, and afraid of making any missteps in my actions or words.

However, last Friday brought a glimmer of hope. A senior female doctor called me into the OR. I spent three hours holding retractors, enduring back pain in silence. When the procedure ended, it was just her and me at the table. She inquired if I saw myself pursuing surgery, and I admitted my serious doubts about my abilities for that path. Her response struck a chord ‚Äì she spoke about how everyone attempts to define your limits as a woman in the medical field, and how she's tired of it. She shared her own experiences as a student, revealing her insecurities and how she hesitated to speak up, almost as if she had sensed my feelings these past few weeks. It was surprising, given her strong demeanor within the team.

For once, I left the OR with a smile, feeling a sense of relief, support, and understanding. I'm the first in my family to pursue higher education and become a doctor. Seven years ago, I was a cashier at 'Toys'R'Us' without even a high school degree.

If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we‚Äôve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. 

And please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They‚Äôre perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a 6oz bottle of water. That‚Äôs 2oz per meal! For those of you who‚Äôve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from 1997, so don‚Äôt let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because ‚Äútheir internet cut out‚Äù. They‚Äôre fine. 

Students: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all 18-22 year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who‚Äôve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We‚Äôre trusting you.

Faculty: Since we don‚Äôt trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in 2003, we‚Äôve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, ‚Äúresidence hall‚Äù). Blinking more than 15 times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. 

Now then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \[drum roll\] spring break! That‚Äôs right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we‚Äôve opted to eliminate spring break in 2021. For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:

* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. 
* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it‚Äôd be to take a job at the next closest university 58.3 miles away. 
* Disconnect from social media.
* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. 
* Make a list of how many days it‚Äôd take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. 

If you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you‚Äôll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA 9th edition format), two doctor‚Äôs notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $2.37 left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn‚Äôt have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother‚Äôs social security number, and President Obama‚Äôs long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. 

Now to answer some other questions you‚Äôve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:

No, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre not ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Do the same thing I‚Äôm convinced you do when you say you‚Äôre working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything‚Äôs normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. 

No, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student‚Äôs taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said ""Their first job is being a student?"" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that ‚ÄúOther duties as assigned‚Äù is a literal statement. 

Yes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff.¬†But if they don‚Äôt like it, they can just go get another job. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? 

No, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. 

I feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration‚Äôs COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don‚Äôt expect your ‚Äúpedagogical mission‚Äù or ‚Äúsafety‚Äù to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don‚Äôt know how you missed this. We sent it via email at 5:01 on last Friday, 23 minutes after we‚Äôd sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email.

1i86g0h,25 Year Old that wants to Go Back to School NYC,"Hey everyone, as the title suggests I am 25 and I want to go back to school. To give a brief history, I have my associates in Biology that I received from a JUCO in NYC and then transferred to a 4 year CUNY. Once I transferred I switched my major to History Grades 7-12. After a year of studies in that field and a few months student teaching, I realized I loved History but not the teaching aspect of it. I ended up just dropping out and finding an office job through connections where I've currently been for the passed 2 years. However now I want to go back to school while I am still young, and need some advice.

If i were to go back to school and continue my studies with history and receive and M.A in the subject, what would be some jobs that I could pursue (not teaching related) and what would be the average salary in NYC or the Tri-State area with said professions? Also I am not opposed to going back to being a Biology major as I have a deep interest in both fields. What would also be some jobs that I could pursue with a M.A in Biology in NYC and what would be the average salaries? 

All help would be greatly appreciated and thank you to everyone in advance.

1n63mnp,[BREAKING NEWS] Admin Solves Burnout,"**Abstract:**  
Admin has finally cracked the code: the cure for clerkship fatigue is a *mandatory 3-hour wellness lecture* and a reflective essay. Mid-rotation. In this non-consensual trial, preliminary data suggests a statistically significant increase in exhaustion, antidepressant use, and caffeine dependency. 

**Introduction:** Burnout has plagued medical students for decades, often attributed to long hours, lack of autonomy, and crushing debt. While prior interventions have focused on improving sleep, mentorship, and workload reduction, these approaches require systemic change and thus were deemed ‚Äúinfeasible‚Äù. Instead, we hypothesized that a single PowerPoint-based intervention would not only solve burnout, but also generate new metrics to justify additional tuition fees.

**Methods:**  
Third-year medical students were forcibly extracted from wards, studying, and ""resident-only"" free lunches. They were then exposed to:

* **3 continuous hours** of lecture, tailored to be perfectly irrelevant to reality.
* **1 reflective essay** assignment with a minimum of 500 words requiring introspection on ‚Äúhow can you identify burnout and what can *you* do to fix it?‚Äù

**Results**:

**Table 1. Post-Intervention Symptoms**

|Symptom|Pre (%)|Post (%)|p-value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Exhaustion|89|92|<0.001|
|Caffeine Consumption|70|96|<0.001|
|Antidepressant Use|32|57|<0.001|
|Gratitude|12|0|NS|

*Figure 1 (not shown): Graph of admin self-satisfaction, which spiked to 100% after rollout.*

**Discussion**:

This intervention conclusively demonstrates that **the most effective way to address overwork is by adding more mandatory work.** Students initially suggested alternatives such as ‚Äúaccessible call rooms for 24 hour shifts‚Äù, ""fixing the only coffee maker students are allowed to use"", or ‚Äúprotected time off,‚Äù but these were rejected for being logistically inconvenient and not in line with the budget funded by *your* tuition. Future directions include a **mandatory wellness quiz** with a greater than 80% required  or students face a remediation course and a **reflection survey** about your reflection essay.

**Conclusion:**  
Burnout officially cured. Please submit your essays by Friday at 5 PM EST (yes, we know our school is in PST) or you‚Äôll fail professionalism.

**TL;DR:** Admin decided the solution to burnout was‚Ä¶ *more things to do.* Inspired by a true story. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1n63mnp/breaking_news_admin_solves_burnout/
18y7khg,Is it possible to change field for PhD?,"Hi there,

I am currently doing my Master's degree in biomedical engineering. I discovered that doing science in academia can be extremely difficult (budget and time restrictions, etc.), so I have lost the passion I had for my field.

I have been learning on my free time more about social matters and the current state of the world (global warming, threat of nuclear war, etc. ), and I feel a strong desire to learn and do something about it. So I thought, why not do a PhD on something related to humanity (anthropology, sociology, global studies, history, anything...) where I can spend most of my time reading and thinking about my interests. I do not really care about the degree, papers, conferences, etc. I only care about using most of time reading what I want. If I had a normal job, I could only do it on my free time, and that would be very demanding.

In short, how difficult is to be accepted in a humanities PhD program when my background is engineering?

Thank you

sm0o5i,The GRE is BS/I‚Äôm sad~ /:,"Yeah so I really wanted/want to go to grad school, but it kind of seems like it‚Äôs on the back burner because everyone says it‚Äôs not worth the money and I know they are right, but a part of me just wants to do it for myself. I got into an MBA program at my undergrad school bc I had a high GPA. I dropped my classes days before it started because I got a FT job 3 months prior and everyone, including my boss, said it would not help me what so ever. I feel like a failure low key for dropping out of it and I think if I tried to go back into the program, I would have to reapply and they would def want GRE scores. 

I originally planned on obviously taking the GRE to try and get into a better school/program. Long story short, I took the GRE 6 months post graduation, and I bombed it. I don‚Äôt do well on standardized testing, but I also probably didn‚Äôt study as much as I should have. I have ADHD, and because there‚Äôs so much ambiguity with the actual test material, it feels impossible to prep for. I‚Äôve honestly just kind of given it up, and felt content with that for a month, but now I‚Äôm sad about it again. 

One of my friends called me yesterday and told me that her boyfriend took the test for the first time (I had been giving her/him advice for several months about the GRE) and he scored like a 320. It‚Äôs obviously great for him, he can go to any school he wants to with that score I‚Äôm sure. It stings for me a bit though. I scored below a 300, that‚Äôs all I will say. I‚Äôm depressed already and none of this helps my self esteem and I just hate that I have to take a test to prove my worth, as if nothing else I‚Äôve ever done matters. It‚Äôs ridiculous. These tests are rigged against people like me and it‚Äôs all for capitalistic profit. It‚Äôs just a bunch of bullshit. 

We can‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh you are worth more than your score.‚Äù Then why are we taking it? I‚Äôm worthless as an applicant without a certain score. I know, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in the same boat‚Äù. But are we? Does everyone have a learning disability? Did everyone grow up with the same academic resources? Absolutely not. It‚Äôs not a mistake that rich people do better than poor ones.

1avzmq6,Students should not have to work while in college full time ,"I don‚Äôt know about other countries, but in the US, When you are a college student there is a general expectation that you also have a job outside of school. If you‚Äôre attending school part time, or you have an easy course load and want to work part time for extra money that‚Äôs all good and fine, but the general expectation for students to work outside of college is insane in my opinion. 

The time demand of a college student who is enrolled in 16-18 units (if they‚Äôre going all of the work and aiming for A‚Äôs in their classes) is generally equivalent to, or more than a full time job, which is 40 hours per week. The expectation is that you spend 3 hours outside of school studying or doing homework per unit taken. Of course a lot of students either cheat or don‚Äôt get an A in the class, but for a student who is studying to the very best of their ability, this is the expectation. So if you‚Äôre enrolled in 18 units it would require 54 hours of work outside of class plus the 18 hours that you are in classes that comes out to 72 hours per week. Now I know that‚Äôs not realistic to begin with, and most students are not spending that much time on coursework, BUT it‚Äôs safe to say that a full time student is busy with school related work at least 40 hours per week. 

The concept of the 40 hour work week was invented so that humans could have time to sleep and take care of themselves, but for some reason as college students we are expected to work jobs in addition to a full time course load. Many students have to work at least part time jobs for money and a lot of them even have to work 40+ hours to make ends meet. Assuming their schoolwork requires 40 hours per week (which is an under estimate) that means an 80 hour work week. I don‚Äôt think it should be this way. I think that for students enrolled in college full time, housing, food, and transportation should be subsidized. 

For students who don‚Äôt have to work, there is generally a stigma around them being unemployed. I can‚Äôt count the amount of times classmates and professors have asked what I do for work and then responded in shock when I told them I don‚Äôt work. And they even say ‚ÄúMust be nice‚Äù but the reality is it‚Äôs just normal and should be this way for everyone. No one acts shocked when a person working full time says they don‚Äôt have a whole other full time job, so why is this the expectation for college students? 

I‚Äôm busy probably 60 hours per week with schoolwork and classes. I cannot imagine having to work another 40 hours per week on top of that. It would require me to limit my sleep, my exercise, my self care etc to a severely unhealthy point and I have a very weak immune system so I would end up getting really sick. I sleep 7-8 hours a night and I get A‚Äôs in all of my classes because school is my full time job and I treat it as such. 

I think that my grades are simply a reflection of my privilege rather than my hard work since I‚Äôm competing against students who barely even have time to sleep. Many of my classmates claim to only sleep 3-4 hour nights, struggle to pass their classes, often miss classes and have to ask me for notes, or come to class unprepared and often look exhausted. I have multiple former classmates who have dropped out due to exhaustion and burnout. It‚Äôs so fucked up to me that this is just a general expectation for the average college student. 

Oh also not to mention we have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college. The system is completely broken. 

Edit: Someone in the comments corrected me. It‚Äôs actually 2 hours of work outside of class and one hour of work in class per unit. So a person taking 18 units would be busy 54 hours per week with school related work, not 72. Still with 40 hours of work outside of school that equals 94 hours per week and with 20 hours of work that equals 74 hours per week.

1mhymv7,working during college?,"as the title says, im thinking about getting a job during college. probably something 10-20 hours a week but i just had a few concerns about burnout due to adding a job onto an already high workload (comp sci 2nd year in major). has anyone who has had a job experienced this while working in college?

1jf79ik,Advice Needed. Is right now the worst time to take a gap year?,"Obviously none of us can predict the future but I would like to hear some outside opinions on this. 

I am a senior undergrad at a fairly prestigious university (US) and I applied for 7 grad programs (bio, but not health related) this cycle. 

I ended up getting 4 interviews that led to 2 rejections (one explicitly due to NIH funding), and 1 acceptance. The program I‚Äôm waiting on I decided I don‚Äôt want to attend anyway. 

The problem: the single acceptance I got was to my ‚Äúsafety:‚Äù a MS program (I applied to all other PhDs) in a city I don‚Äôt want to live in, with a stipend so stupidly low I would have to take out loans for rent. The profs I spoke to there thought the chances of finding a project for me to transition to a PhD are good, but I realized I do not want a PhD from there. This college just isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the reputation and connections of my current undergrad. 

On the one hand, I feel like I could do better. I got an interview at a top 10 university, and this one barely makes the top 250. I didn‚Äôt apply to several more prestigious schools because of imposter syndrome, and now I regret it. I know rankings aren‚Äôt everything, but I feel like I‚Äôm worth more than this and their god awful stipend. 

On the other hand, I feel like the chances of getting a job (preferably as a lab tech, I just want to stay in my field) for a gap year are slim to none. I would go crazy living with my parents unemployed for a year, but that‚Äôs the likely outcome I‚Äôm looking at. It would give me the opportunity to reapply this fall, but I‚Äôm terrified things are only going to get worse, and against all the other funding rejects from this year combined with next year‚Äôs applicants, I won‚Äôt get in anywhere.

1la0465,Struggling with criticism from lab mates,"Hi all,

I'm 2 months into my PhD and currently feeling very overwhelmed. I'm a fresh masters graduate doing independent research for the first time. My immediate lab mates are M (4 months ahead of me) and S (1 year ahead). I rely on them a lot because I'm new to this field and doing these experiments for the first time. I usually confirm the experiment steps with them, including basics like which lab to go to, which materials to use, where to find them, etc. since the papers don't provide detailed instructions which I first need to start off my work.

Today, M and S gave me a 45-minute feedback session where S just pointed out all of my mistakes and M just listened. This hurt me especially because M and I sit next to each other, have lunch together and try to make weekend plans (they dont work out because something or the other gets in the way). S went on about how I don't plan experiments properly, how I ask too many questions even about the basics, etc. S would start off by asking me some questions about my confidence in certain techniques, and when i said ""i think so"", she just said ""no, i dont think so"" and continued listing out my errors. The entire experience shook me - 45 minutes of just listening to my mistakes with no feedback or improvements or empathy. A few hours after this, I cried in the bathroom. The minute I reached home, I called up a friend and bawled. I'm feeling very humiliated, demotivated, and underconfident. For a while, I was thinking that I am not cut out for a PhD because I didnt expect all this to happen so soon. I knew that a PhD would be difficult, but I did not expect this behavior from my lab mates. I dont know if its normal or not. I'm feeling hopeless and lost.

To make things more confusing, M had suggested I start an experiment today (Friday) that would include a Sunday time point, but then M and S later told me I hadn‚Äôt planned properly, without checking if I had permissions and confirmed I had all the reagents and materials (I did have permission and the reagents).

Now I‚Äôm nervous about upcoming training sessions with them on important instruments. I want to get better and more independent but feel stuck between asking for help and fearing judgment. I‚Äôm also considering talking to my supervisor about this but worry about making things worse. I'm very lost because M and I have related experiments for our first objective and I really feel bad that they didn't check in on me after the talk.

I'm looking for tips/advice on how to navigate:

\- Building independence and confidence when protocols aren't clear and I dont feel safe enough to ask questions

\- Dealing with harsh feedback without it affecting my mental peace

\- Should I bring this up to my supervisor without giving names?

\- Is there any way I can subtly let M or S know that while I appreciate their intention and feedback, this is not the way to help someone?

Thank you in advance. Any advice or tips would help me a lot.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1la0465/struggling_with_criticism_from_lab_mates/

So my bf is applying to Penn IM residency this year and has been talking about it nonstop for weeks. He‚Äôs been wanting this for as long as he‚Äôs known the school and mentions it anytime we‚Äôre together.

I‚Äôm totally cool with that and have supported him through it all. He definitely has the stats to get in so I‚Äôm proud of him, but its an insane obsession now. He‚Äôs visited the school about 6 times and says how much he loves everything about the school and I mean EVERYTHING.

1iru58x,Newly Hired Graduate Vice Chair Does Not Have Any Degrees in the Field of My Department - Very Frustrated and Not Sure What to Do Next,"I am currently in my second year in a Ph.D. program in applied math at a smaller R1 public STEM university that is primarily known for subjects other than math or stats. To be honest the experience of this program has not been what I expected so far and the mutual fit is not good. I applied to 14 Ph.D. programs and this was the only one that accepted me. In particular, most faculty and students in my department are most interested in the application of stats and math to specific problems in the geosciences. I have no interest in the geosciences and my research focus is the development of hybrid deterministic-ML techniques for numerical optimization and PDEs. Although I passed all of the core classes for my program I did not feel that I got much out of them. In particular, the level of depth and mathematical rigor in these courses was for the most part lower than what I had seen in my undergrad courses and the experience of starting research basing almost entirely from what I had learned in undergrad has been very frustrating.

My department recently promoted an existing professor to be the new graduate vice chair. This person does not have any degrees in math or stats and instead only has degrees in geophysics. Looking at her Google scholar shows only geophysics, not math or stats, publications. Even though she has held the position of  professor at other universities, it was in geoscience, not math or stats, departments. The first time she taught a university level math class was when she taught an undergrad course in my department in 2023. I do not see why she should be the grad vice chair given she has no formal university education in math or stats and is only interested in doing research in a different field. Furthermore, I felt I got along really well with the previous grad vice chair and now I will not have that professional relationship with the new one. 

I had a conversation about dropping out of the program with the previous grad vice chair this past summer but he was able to convince me otherwise. In fact, he challenged me to get someting going with research, which I have and I am going to present something at a conference in April.

r6ghoy,How strict are profs with word counts? Is this reasonable?,"I had a discussion post assignment that asked for 200 words. It said in the requirements to avoid going over 200 words, but that we could go over by a little without penalty. Anyways, I took this to mean that I should avoid going over 200 words, and that the word count requirement was not extremely strict.

This discussion post assignment was pass/fail, so you can either get a 0 or 100. 

I wrote 198 words. She gave me a 0 because I didn't meet the 200 word requirement. I put a lot of work into writing my discussion post well, and it was all just a waste of time and effort because of two words. I sent her an email explaining my situation and how I didn't realize she wanted EXACTLY 200 words (nowhere in the requirements did she clearly say we needed EXACTLY 200 words). She replied saying there were no exceptions, so I'm stuck with a 0 on this assignment.

The ironic thing is that this was for a creative writing class, and the content of my writing had no bearing in the mark but writing exactly 200 words did.

1le1gmv,Being sidelined by a colaborator in my first paper,"Hi everyone.

TL;DR: below.

I‚Äôm a third year PhD student in computer science.

A few months ago, a postdoc joined our group to work on a topic closely related to mine. At first, I was thrilled: he‚Äôs experienced, was supervised by a reputable professor during his PhD, and could bring useful insights to the paper I was already writing with my supervisors.

Initially, things felt collaborative. My supervisors and I agreed to include him as a author in exchange for feedback and maybe some additional ideas. He proposed two experiments: one he carried out himself, the other I was assigned to run. I was fully on board because my goal was to publish in a well-regared conference.

But things quickly shifted.

The experiment I was working on returned inconclusive results, despite his instructions. I voiced concerns several times, even in meetings. He kept insisting the results should be meaningful and eventually redid the whole experiment himself using my code ‚Äî only to later admit the results weren‚Äôt conclusive either. Then, without any discussion, he quietly designed and ran a new experiment while I was on a two-week vacation.

The day before I left on vacation, he said we should rush to publish a preprint because his former colleagues are working on a similar idea and he wanted to ‚Äúget there first.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt fully convinced by the urgency, especially since the results were shaky, but agreed to resume when I returned. Everyone agreed to wait for me before moving forward.

When I came back, I was shocked: he had replaced the inconclusive experiment (after admiting the results were incoclusive) with a different one entirely, already implemented it, analyzed it, and started writing. Without me. I asked for time to re-implement and verify the work or understand the changes but he kept pushing for submission.

Then came the real shift. He declared the whole narrative I had built with my supervisors over several months ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù and would be criticized by reviewers. I disagreed, it made sense to me and my supervisors before he arrived. But we spent two exhausting weeks arguing over the framing of the paper. Eventually, we agreed we‚Äôd co-develop a revised outline with my supervisors. But he showed up to the meeting with a fully prepared version and pushed aggressively for it. My supervisors accepted it and I felt forced to agree just to avoid yet another round of endless arguing.

Now, he‚Äôs assigning who writes what. He even claimed that my main contribution was very similar to an existing work (which is totally not true and i convinced my supervisors with that after a long discussion and justifications).

He speaks with extreme confidence in meetings, dominates conversations, and presents his views as fact. Even when he‚Äôs wrong, my supervisors tend to side with him.

I‚Äôm still listed as first author, but it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. The paper no longer reflects the work I spent months building. My ideas were rewritten, reduced, or sidelined entirely. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my voice. Every time I try to explain or stand my ground, I feel like I‚Äôm being ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù My supervisors go quiet. They seem tired, maybe just eager to get the paper submitted.

I‚Äôm tired too. Deeply so. So now I‚Äôm cooperating, writing what I was told, following the new outline. But I don‚Äôt recognize the paper. I feel demoralized and disconnected from something that was originally mine.

**TL;DR:** A new postdoc joined our lab and quickly took control of my first paper. He pushed his own experiments, rewrote the entire narrative, and insisted on his outline, which my supervisors passively accepted. I‚Äôm still listed as first author, but most of my original work was minimized or removed. He‚Äôs dominant, fast, and presents his ideas as absolute. I‚Äôve grown exhausted fighting back, and now I‚Äôm just trying to finish the paper even though I barely recognize it anymore.

Any advice or perspective would be appreciated. I want to grow from this, but I also feel deeply lost right now. Thanks üôè ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1le1gmv/being_sidelined_by_a_colaborator_in_my_first_paper/
1lskj8a,Thinking of going back to school!,"I‚Äôve been in and out of school for a few years now. My freshman year officially started in 2016 where I did two and half years of community college before transferring to university. I majored in English: Creative Writing with a minor in communications, originally hoping to land a job in the publishing world. Basically, I struggled with depression while being in an abusive relationship and couldn‚Äôt afford the amount of classes I was forcing myself to take (15 credit hours) and ended up failing or withdrawing classes before dropping out completely. 8 years later, and I‚Äôve grown sooo much! After meeting my fianc√©, I found a love for designing and am heavily interested in events, styling, and writing still. I have over 80 credit hours to transfer from before, but I don‚Äôt think an English degree would challenge me the way I need. 

So I am considering going back to school for either a major in communications and minor in graphic design or double majoring in communications AND graphic design with a minor in media studies. I want to work in events, or have my own business, or eventually be creative director somewhere. I feel I need the expertise to back it up to make it a reality, though and I feel more than ready to commit myself to it!

13nf83t,Another instructor copied my syllabus - normal?,"I‚Äôm a part time instructor in an academic English program, going into my 6th semester teaching a course.

For scheduling reasons, I can only teach 2 sections this semester. I was curious about what the other instructor was going to do in his course, so i took a look at his syllabus in the shared folder. It‚Äôs exactly the same as mine, with just his name, e-mail, and section numbers changed. Of course a lot of it is university-lawyer-written boilerplate stuff, but the parts I spent hours to customize are all copied. Same schedule I slaved over (it‚Äôs a weird combined-levels class where different groups of students attend on different days; setting it all up and getting all the dates in was non-trivial); same clear attendance policy (adapted from the program‚Äôs boilerplate text to make it clearer for our English-learner students); same activities, etc. Even the section about plagiarism.

How would you handle this? On the one hand, I‚Äôm somewhat flattered. As a part-time instructor with only a master‚Äôs degree, I definitely suffer from imposter syndrome at times. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think I would ever do such a thing, especially without even a quick email to the other instructor. I might start from what they had done and then adapt it significantly, but never directly copy.

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth saying something to my program head or not. I‚Äôm also concerned for his students, since I had some basic things like ‚ÄúCanvas instructions quiz due‚Äù in the schedule, and I know what that is but he and his students won‚Äôt.

What would you do in my position?


UPDATE: I reached out to my program head (exact text in the comments) and got this back:

>	Dear Mobius,

>	Thanks for your message, and I'm sorry for this. [Copier] didn't receive his contract until after syllabi were due, so I think he probably pulled yours just to get something submitted as soon as he could. I'm going to message him about changing it today. I don't condone the stealing of other adjuncts' syllabi at all. Using one of my own standard syllabi would be different, but you developed this, and I think it's yours. I'll have him change things.

>Thanks again!


>Take care, [program head]



So it‚Äôs basically what I thought it was. The copier signed on late, and my head wasn‚Äôt cool with it (as I strongly suspected he wouldn‚Äôt be given our past interactions).

I‚Äôm honestly so frustrated and emotionally drained.

1ks75m4,"Just another ‚ÄúI want to quit my PhD, here's  a rant + please give me advice"" post","So I (25), am in a cognitive neuroscience/psychology program in the U.S., have just finished my first year of grad school, and been grappling with the urge to quit. Quick warning, this is going to be stupidly long, but I guess it's helping me to deal with things. 

If you'd still like to offer advice, but aren't looking for reading material, I've marked at the bottom in bold where I finally get to it. I'd really, *really* appreciate it.

**The background:**

There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with my program. It‚Äôs great‚ÄîI‚Äôve made a few friends in my cohort, my advisor is awesome, and the department is incredibly supportive. I‚Äôve been doing pretty well, all things considered.

I‚Äôm usually a perfectionist, pouring everything into whatever I do. Yes, that can absolutely be a recipe for burnout. And for a long time, even before starting the program, I thought, ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs it. Maybe I‚Äôm just burnt out, and need to push my way through it.‚Äù

All I‚Äôve really identified with, with any pride anyway, is academia. You know, the whole ‚Äútop of the class‚Äù persona in grade school. Even after I crashed out from that mentality, I just sort of shifted back into it in my undergrad, taking on way too many RA positions and duties‚Äîhonors thesis, TA-ships, early publications and all, all to get where I am now.

I went straight into a post-baccalaureate position after, where I guess I just finally ran out of juice. That, and I actually started to live like a real young person with the amazing friends I made there. I fell behind on work, and kept slipping into bouts of escapism, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to face the pile of guilt next to the grave I dug in it. As it got worse, I pulled away from my social support and just started working from home. I was, without exaggeration, straight up failing, just not doing the things I needed to do, for the first time in my life.

I felt like there was something wrong with me, and I just needed to get back to the old me, the one that could actually do things and could do them *right*.

And here I am, having paid the application fees, plastered the perfect smile on my face, recited the practiced elevator pitches and research plans, and pretended to love the process enough times to make it into the place I still thought, would finally fix everything. Or finally make me proud of myself.

Like I said, I‚Äôve actually done decently, but ridiculously slow. Not just in the way all academics hold themselves to high expectations. I genuinely couldn‚Äôt get myself to do even basic tasks for weeks, ones that when I finally forced myself to, took me maybe thirty minutes. I panicked at the thought of meeting with my advisor, having to find something to report on or some excuse why it was taking so long. I was disgusted with myself for my lack of output, and what it meant about me. So to stave off ever actually feeling any of the guilt I was carrying, I played games, listened to books, watched shows‚Äîanything to escape.

Again, I had never done this before. I had never, ever found myself *just not caring*, and I couldn‚Äôt recognize myself.

I know I probably sound self-pitying, but I just feel angry, scared, and sick honestly.

I know I‚Äôve really just been lying to myself, more than anyone else, that this is for me. Being a scientist is the only part of me I know how to be proud of. But it‚Äôs also the only thing I‚Äôve ever really let myself consider, and one of the only prestigious-sounding things that were encouraged growing up, socially, and financially.

I know I love the idea of it, the conferences, the talks, and probably, the self-respect I can‚Äôt stop believing I‚Äôll find through it one day. But I also know that I don‚Äôt have any love for the process, the moments that the real, present-version of me has to live through. And I know that there‚Äôs been nothing wrong with me‚ÄîI‚Äôve felt more and more like this the farther I‚Äôve gotten in therapy, and I do have passions I can lose myself in that could be financially supportive.

So, I know I want to quit. The moment I thought of a life outside academia, I think I felt this ridiculously-cheesy sounding sense of freedom. Maybe I could finally settle in somewhere, without the sense of looming doom of having to find yet another apartment, another location, that wasn‚Äôt a thousand miles from my partner for once. Maybe trips and life milestones and even having decent money while I‚Äôm still young weren‚Äôt just pipe dream fantasies reserved for everyone else.

None of this is to bash academia or anyone who loves it. I envy you, really. I just wish I could love it more, and enough to make the journey worth it for myself.

**That‚Äôs the way too long expose.**

I have an exit plan. I could find a job in data science with my skills and undergrad statistics focus, and with real free-time, maybe even finally dare to try to find the creative pursuit I‚Äôve been starving for. I could move back in with my wonderful partner, who makes enough for both of us‚Äîso it'd be okay if I didn't find a new job immediately.

But the way of thinking that‚Äôs kept me here is a hard habit to shake. I keep thinking about my PI and my previous advisors, the one‚Äôs who looked at me and my work and saw potential. I think of the whispers I‚Äôd leave‚Äîthat I couldn‚Äôt take it or I wasn‚Äôt strong or smart enough. I know it stupid, but it‚Äôs there.

**Here's the part where I actually ask for advice.**

**(1)** I can get a master's before leaving if I finish out the next year and complete my courses. I already have a lease for the next year signed for a new apartment here. But I want to be honest with my advisor, who's been nothing but good to me and would deserve to know and plan for it - and probably would want to go ahead and hand off my project to someone else. Still, I'd probably be dropped the moment I mentioned it, right? If I finally find the nerve to leave, when should I say it?

**(2)** How do I actually do it? How do I leave behind this part of me I don't really know how to exist without? How do I deal with the disapointment that I'll cause? Even though I know it's a temporay pain for a really important long-term decsion, I'm not a brave person. I don't know if I can pull the trigger, even if I know that I'll regret it if I don't.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ks75m4/just_another_i_want_to_quit_my_phd_heres_a_rant/

I'm trying to find a way of working smarter and not  harder, but simply working for the university is enough work and when I  have some free time (which I don't), I'm either focusing on my  relationships or I'm just too exhausted to work on my thesis.

To give a little bit of background information about myself, I'm a current med student in a relationship. However, I dated two med students before I started medical school. I also spent a little too much time lurking on this sub before matriculation, being the gunner I am.

Before I say anything, I will say yes, medical school is extremely difficult. It takes an immense amount of time, sacrifice, and resources, and will end up impacting your mental health and relationships at some point. The person you are with has to understand that going in. There will be nights where you talk to them for five minutes before crashing in bed. There will be days where you cancel plans because you have to study. There will be times where school destroys you mentally and emotionally and your SO will have to pick up the pieces and put them back together. Your partner is going to have to understand that they will essentially be the 1b priority for the next four years (if not longer).

All that being said, Jesus Christ. Some of you treat your partners terribly. They are not your 24/7 on-call therapists for you to constantly complain about everything in your life: school, family, finances, your friends and classmates, even the relationship itself. You cannot expect endless emotional support with almost none in return. They are also human beings. They have off days, they have frustrations, they get stressed, they make mistakes. Giving yourself maximum grace because you're in medical school and extremely stressed while giving them very little is ridiculous. They're also not robots. They're people with emotions who go through good times and bad times. If their bad times (within reason) become a burden to you and stress you out while you're constantly venting about the bad time that is medical school, you're a bad partner.

Giving them very little time or attention. Sure, you may text throughout the day, but if you go weeks without doing things as a couple, whether it's going out for a meal, watching a movie, or just enjoying time in each other's presence, then why are you in this relationship? I understand there are certain blocks and rotations where time is scarce, but again, this is your partner. They are supposed to be priority 1b, not priority 17. I've seen classmates who make sure they sleep a certain number of hours a day, meal prep, exercise for 30 minutes to an hour multiple days a week, get research and shadowing in, even occasionally hang out with friends or classmates, and when they finish their exams, they go out to celebrate and let off some steam. I then hear them complain that their boyfriend or girlfriend is upset they never get to see them. If in all that you aren't finding a few moments of time for the person who is emotionally supporting you through all this, then you are a bad partner, plain and simple.

Cheating, oh my goodness. Cheating is rampant. I understand you're getting a bunch of 20-year-olds and putting them in the same space for hours a week, but holy shit. The first week of med school I saw multiple classmates cheat on their partners during orientation. I've seen students get drunk and end up in strangers' beds. I've seen students making out with classmates at the bar in front of everyone when we all know they're in relationships. I've seen people break up with the person they dated for years in college and who supported them on their premed journey because they wanted to ""see what was out there."" Medicine is the only field I've ever known, so perhaps there are other fields where it's worse, but I don't think I've ever seen people use their partners more transactionally than med students. It's almost psychotic.

Long-distance? Forget about it. Those of you who make it work are incredible people, and I wish more people in this world in general were willing to put as much effort into their relationships as you do. Some of you, however, are the opposite. You have to go wherever you get in for medical school. This is our dream, and we are willing to move to Timbuktu to achieve it. That being said, the parameters of a long-distance relationship are different, and you have to adjust. Being in a relationship as a med student, your partner will already have to sacrifice a lot. In this case, they may have to be the one making a lot of the trips to come see you. They may have to be the one that moves to be closer to you. If they're willing to do these things and you are not going to support them at all in return, then please do not be in a relationship.

I dated someone going to school in San Francisco. She was constantly complaining about the distance, and I was ready to move out there, leaving my friends and family behind to be with her and support her during school. She, however, wanted to live with her friends, so she essentially wanted me to move out there and get my own place. Her family financially supported her, so her apartment was paid for. My apartment would not be. She also wanted me to have an open-door policy where she could come see me whenever she was stressed, needed to vent, or wanted to spend the night. If those same things happened to me, I would have to text her in advance, and she would then decide on whether I could come stay with her or if she was too busy and needed to focus. Needless to say, I did not move to San Francisco and ended the relationship. This was just the tip of the iceberg, but long story short, long-distance is tough for everyone. If you're in one as a med student, please keep in mind it is not easy for either party. Be kind.

The responses of other med students, whether on here or in person, are wild. Anytime I see a post about someone going through a painful breakup on this subreddit, the comments are essentially along the lines of, ""This person didn't deserve you. You are going to be a successful doctor making good money, and if they can't deal with the circumstances of you being a med student, then they're a bad partner."" Bitch, no. Some of you don't understand this, so I will say it very clearly: you becoming a doctor and making a great salary does not mean your partner has to put up with years of bullshit. Again, they will not be the main priority, but they should be 1b. If you want 1b to be taken up by something else, whether family, friends, having fun, whatever the case, then do not be in a relationship. I wish medicine actually attracted the most kind and empathetic people to the field, but in reality, a large portion of med students are people in their early twenties who come from affluent backgrounds, have no life experience, and have never really had to struggle in life. This tends to reflect in how their relationships go.

I know that some people will read this and get upset, perhaps because they recognize some of the things they did to people they were in a relationship with and they don't want to admit it, and others because this is an extremely long and poorly written post that wasted 5 minutes of their life that they will never get back. I'm sure many of you are great partners, given the circumstances, who do as much as they can to be with their forever person. Others of you, I don't even know what to say. Your partner is not an emotional dumping ground for you to pull off the shelf when you feel like it and throw away when things become slightly inconvenient.  Please, just be kind.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mmnbu6/some_of_you_are_terrible_romantic_partners_and/

I'm at a super competitive and elite university with a great fellowship plus external funding from a scholarship that I won in my country. I am young - younger than most people in grad school here anyway - and thus people kind of perceive me as an overachiever, as someone who has it all figured out, as some sort of fucking genius in her best years.

But I'm not. I'm struggling with classes and workload and I can't cope with the amount of work and expectations that's being demanded of me. I'm struggling with the lack of control that I have over so much stuff and with this element of unknown that reigns in my life.

Simultaneously, I just can't adapt to life here. And I've tried. I've gone to parties, I've tried to connect with the international communities on campus (but there are none related to my nationality), I've tried to socialize with people within my department, I've tried focusing on my work... But I feel like I just don't belong anywhere. I feel really alone, unappreciated and like no one really understands me at all. And I feel like I just don't belong anywhere. Anywhere at all. And so I feel like I'm wasting those that are supposed to be ""the best years of my life"".

ijd05e,"Considering dropping out of college, want to hear from others","As the title says, I‚Äôm considering dropping out of college. I truthfully don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm here anymore. I started college way back in 2014, and it has been nothing but a battle since. Through the last 6 years, it has been a constant struggle financially and family problems have been abundant. I have had constant swings of anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôve neared a full mental breakdown on several occasions at this point. Withdrawals, failures, and college major changes have happened in near cycles at this point, and I don‚Äôt have any motivation left in me to even open up a textbook at all anymore. I feel I can barely even look at a course syllabus anymore. I am presently a dual statistics and economics major, and even through all this time, I still have 2 years left just to finish undergrad. That‚Äôs with attending full time. 

Last winter, I partnered with a good friend of mine who went on to do his own thing in life and became a developer with IBM. We are now developing 4 different platforms, and we are less than 5 months away from a marketable MVP on our primary platform. In January, I plan to begin traveling all over to take our mission to stage 2. 

At this point, I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm in college anymore. I believe I‚Äôve found what I want to do after all of this struggle, and I don‚Äôt know anymore if my desire to finish college is just because I was told I needed it all my life or if I truly want that piece of paper.

1ggph6v,Have I destroyed my life?,"Hello everyone, l am a tirst year student in olEM In US coming from europe. I've been struggling with some taughts for a while and I needed some advice from people who are actually in academia. Any advice would be much appreciated. A little bit of background. I've completed my undergrad and Masters in europe both in engineering. For PhD I've applied to US and I was able to get accepted by two schools, lets call them school A and school B.
School A is a top 10 school in reputation, but the program I was in has just recently started, (just over 10 years) and school is not famous for its engineering programs. However, it was able to attract giant names from my field and it has very good ties with National Labs located in a big city.
School B is a state school, with a mediocre ranking but a legend in my field. However, they lost all of their big names recently and faculty was very young.
The decision process for me was very though but I decided to go with School A mainly for 2 reasons:
Brand name, the research was very similar to what I did in Masters. When I was conversating with one particular Pl from school B during the decision process, l've got starstruck. He was super kind, all his students seemed like really liked him and his research was super interesting. I really wanted to worked with him, but I couldn't dare to change my mind last second. Mostly because, his research is very distant from what I did before (he is a computational mathematician and I was an experimental soft materials), and I was afraid if he wouldn't take me I didn't have any one that I was too interested in that school. Now I recently completed my first year in School A and, oh boy, do I regret decision. First of all I cant forget about the rese. of that Pl from School B. And it kills my motivation for my own research. Second of all, talking with and talking with and seeing with 6th or 7th year PhD students from my lab, I realize that this program might not be that great for career as well. They are struggling really hard with find a job or graduating. One of them actually told me that one of my PIl am co-advised), has actually killed all their grad students careers.
And now I am terrified. I am afraid that I will never like my research again and spend 7 years of my life for something that I will not care and wont be even able to find a job. Currently, things are not that bad.
My Pls are happy with my work. (Both of them are giants in their field. One of them is an
experimentalist, the other is computation) I was able to get some results and might even publish soon.
Yet, these thoughts are really hard to overcome. So l am undecided about what to do. Should I just go on with it and try to love my research? Should I drop out, and re-apply? I am 28 years old and re applying seems really scary, especially seeing all my friends progressing in their lives. I am also afraid that dropping out from a program would really kill my chances of having an acceptance again from a good school.

1lv3srq,Debating on grad school/my whole future,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently coming to the close of my bachelor's in chemistry and biochemistry (combined) - going from 3rd to 4th year. Ever since I figured practicing medicine just wouldn't keep me happy after volunteering at a hospital, I've been pretty set on doing a PhD after I graduate to work in something related to chemistry/biochemistry (enzymology, neurochemistry, or medchem).

Over time, as my perspective on what practicing chemistry/biochemistry and being a natural scientist is like has grown, the enthusiasm, care, and dedication I feel I once had in prior years has dwindled.

**My thoughts:**

I'm not sure whether it's due to being burnt out from crunching this degree and every related major course possible at my institution into 4 years or whether I've found out that being a natural scientist and going through the experimental process every day for the rest of my life just isn't for me.

A large part of this may be due to the failure I'm experiencing as a volunteer in a chemistry research lab. I feel as though the experimental process is brutal, unresponsive, and unsatisfying to me - and I'd much rather be making something than discovering it. However, this may just be due to my higher experience in the latter making me unconfident. I also don't even know which of the three fields mentioned prior I want to go into, and it feels as though I need to make this decision to know what lab group I should apply to be a part of.

**My plans:**

With all this coming so fast (and some advice from others) I figured that I may need to take a year gap between graduating and grad school to figure out what I want to do, but the problem is - how??

My initial thoughts are to try and fill the gap in a research lab at my institution or a nearby industry to gain perspective on what it may be like to work in a lab full time before I commit to grad school/that field, but I worry that this won't let me recover from my burnout or discover whether something entirely seperate from science is better for me. The other option is to just spend a year in a job unrelated to science to take a break and see how much I really want to come back.

.

.

TLDR; burnt out at the end of my undergrad. How do I find out what I really want to do during my ""gap"" year, even if that may be not going into academia at all?

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? Sorry if this was quite long, I just wanted to make my context very clear. Thank you so much for reading if you did:) ü´∂

2.Get exposure to a different side of business and maybe work in analytics
3.Get out of a shitty environment and have a convenient excuse for leaving

I enrolled in the program but ended up getting a new accounting job which I kind of like, so I decided to do the program on a part time basis. 

Now I'm almost half way done with the program sitting at 12 credits (burnt about 13k of my own money. To finish the program I would need to spend around 19k more plus time and effort. 

I don't really enjoy the classes (though some classes are interesting), or even want to work in analytics at this point, and the 150 credit requirement to take the CPA in my state has been removed.

1ck6nzj,"After 3 years, I'm Dropping Out; Advice Needed","I'll try to keep this short! Essentially I've always been into art and drawing, so naturally out of high school, I went to college for a studio arts degree. But after two semesters I realized I would absolutely \*hate\* working in that industry, so all of a sudden I had no idea what I wanted to do, as I had no real career motives aside from that.

Flash forward a year, I finish up my AA, but I still have no idea what I want to do. I'm basically squandering away my time taking random classes to see if anything seems interesting, but it's all more so for an easy grade. I like what I'm learning, but I just can't seem to find anything that makes me say ""this is what I want to do.""

Flash froward one more year, basically all I've done is get my AA and made no progress on any sort of 4-year degree due to taking random classes the entire time. So I consider just dropping out. I'm wasting my time, and I already have a decent job I'm making an okay living at for now.

I'm just really terrified of the prospect of regretting it heavily. I know I'll likely want to come back to school in a couple of years, maybe after I discover a career I'm passionate about. I know it's easier to get better paying jobs with a full 4-year degree. And at the moment, I have a full ride to college, so of course I feel like I failed and just waisted this absolutely incredibly lucky opportunity just because my original plan fell through.

So I'm hoping someone can give me some perspective. Did anyone else here drop out and come back later on? Did it end up working out? Was it difficult? Or just kinda part of the journey? I'm just curious to here as I have no idea where my life might be going or what I might want to do lol

  
Edit: Thank you guys for all your input and advice! I seriously can't thank you guys enough! While I felt sort of decided before, I was definitely stressed and not at all satisfied with dropping out entirely. I just felt as though I truly messed up my chance at a degree, but reading all your advice helped a ton! I decided to change course and jump right back into my old art degree (I realized starting over with an entirely new degree might be a bit too difficult / take too long, as my ""full ride"" is set to end in two years). Even if it's not the degree I want, I can still use it in a lot of ways in the future! Plus, I'd have a ton of peace of mind just having any degree, and I wouldn't have to completely start all over.

When I started my PhD journey, I hoped to eventually secure a place at an academic institution.

However, as time went on, I realized that I‚Äôm just an ordinary person. I should have realized this sooner, but I guess I was lying to myself.

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt finish my PhD‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm struggling. I could finish it, but then what? Would my talent be enough to support further academic development? I‚Äôve lost the passion at the beginning.

Another frustrating part of being a math PhD student is the limited career options in industry. I searched online, but the information wasn‚Äôt encouraging. If I were in computer science or engineering, at worst, I could simply find a job. But with a math PhD? Jobs like quant roles only prefer people from top schools, and software development requires a computer science background. Even if I finish the PhD, I still might not find a decent job. I have lost the motivation to finish the PhD 

This is what I call a math diploma dilemma: if you quit, you lose almost everything; if you stay, you gain almost nothing.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1gulfr8/struggling_and_depressed_as_a_math_phd_help/
1jk6lef,Mentor requested surgery be moved up w/o mentee consent,"I am currently in the 3rd year of my PhD and have started having some difficulties managing my mentor/mentee relationship. Before all of this, our relationship was great! But started to go downhill when my experiments began not working before my first thesis committee meeting. 

In Fall of 2024, around October, I started to fall ill due to a chronic health condition which ultimately lead to needing surgery to address the issue. I was nauseous everyday, would have urgent (if you catch my drift) upper and lower GI symptoms, would be in constant pain that would worsen when I would eat, random chills, reoccurring fevers, and serious fatigue. Most days I would lay in bed sleeping or feeling so ill I would be unable to stand up. This affected my ability to do my laundry, wash my dishes, cook for myself, bathe etc.. Being in my early 20s, this was extremely difficult going from being able bodied and productive, to feeling constant guilt and anger towards myself for not being able to function. 

As you can imagine, this deeply impacted my productivity towards my PhD (I take full responsibility). Realistically, I was regularly missing 2 days a week from lab, and while I tried to pick up the slack from home, there is no replacement for physically being at the bench in a wet lab. It was about the same time my illness began to come through that my experiments began not working, compounding the issue. My mentor expressed they were not satisfied with my progress (neither was I) and I made the decision to have surgery. Fast forward to scheduling the surgery, the only availability they had was <2 months away, so I took it and tried my best to produce as much data as I could beforehand. Which again, my experiments were still not going smoothly, and I continued to get worse physically as I tried to push myself to appease my mentor. My mentor then took it upon themself to email my surgeon WITHOUT my consent, requesting my date be moved up, then texted me the new date, ‚Äùyou see that and confirm?‚Äù(Someone say HIPAA!). While I would have wanted the surgery sooner, I had no one to drive and stay with me that day or after, nor could I get a pre-op appointment rescheduled to have the necessary bloods done (required week before surgery). When I notified the mentor I would be continuing with the current scheduled date, I was told I was making a mistake.

Since having returned from surgery, I have been threatened with academic probation repeatedly, have had remarks about my condition made to my lab mates by the mentor behind my back, was told I was prioritizing my personal life when I was sick, have been directly insulted to my face in response to sharing data that was normalized incorrectly,‚Äù do you have eyes? Can you see?‚Äù, have been told if im unwilling or unable to come in on the weekends that I am not fit for a PhD, among other things. The last banger, was when they told me they would be shocked if I hadn‚Äôt thought about mastering out. Then immediately after the conversation, went and told our Tech I was dropping out! I wish.

The anxiety I have developed from this relationship has sent me into panic attacks on numerous occasions, so much so I had to start taking anxiety medication. I feel confused, I feel crazy, I feel guilty, I feel bullied. Since coming back from surgery, I have been putting in the work, maybe I eased back in for a week or two, but I JUST had an organ removed! It feels like anything I do at this point will not change their attitude towards me and I feel as if I am being pushed out, conveniently right around the time the training grant I am being paid through is ending. From my perspective, it seems I fell ill and my productivity dropped, they became mad because I wasn‚Äôt producing data like I used to, and are now resentful and/or acting in retaliation because they do not think I am worth the upcoming cost. I do not feel seen as a person, only a means to an end. If anyone has any suggestions on what I should do or alternative perspectives, it would be much appreciated. I am to the point that I want to finish this PhD because I am almost 3 years deep, but if I continue to be treated like this, there feels like no other choice than to leave. I cannot put up with 2 more years of this.

***It is also important to point out, this has not been the first mentee under this mentor who has dealt with issues pertaining to illness. I have also tried to get them to see my perspective and understand the constraints I faced with chronic illness. They don‚Äôt seem receptive and instead rehash their discontent with my previous effort. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1jk6lef/mentor_requested_surgery_be_moved_up_wo_mentee/

1f6p4k9,"I didn‚Äôt think I would ever finish, but I successfully defended! ","This groups was such a support during my last months job wanted to share my story. 

I planned to hand in my thesis in June and defend in July. Around March I was three months behind schedule and started to burnout. I need three manuscripts, a general introduction, and a general discussion in my thesis and by the end of April I had two manuscripts done with a third that still needed data analysis and writing. I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I would be able to finish at the end of June and end of July also seemed like a stretch. I spoke with my advisor who generously gave me an extra month. 

I took weekends and evenings off as much as a could and focused on getting as much done as a could during the work day. Of course I needed up working late into the evening and weekends for the last month, but that was doable as the end was insight. 

I want to stress how little a believed in myself. I booked my official defense date in the last possible day and the same for my defense room. I really did not think it would be possible, but I put one foot in front of the other and handed in my thesis at the end of July. 

I then had so much stress about my defense which I had a month to prepare for. It was a 20 minute presentation with at least one hour of questions. Again, I was convinced I would fail. The chances of failure were one in a million. There had not been a failure of a defense in 50 years at my university. Yet, I convinced myself I would be the exception. Everyone says you‚Äôre the expert in your topic and I did not believe that either. I practiced my presentation 2-3 times per day and re-read my papers until the day before. The day of the defense I was so terrified, but a calm came over me at the defense itself. As I started getting questioned, I realized how much I knew and really started to feel like the expert I am. Everything went great, and I received a lot of comments about how calm and enjoyable the presentation and discussion were. Now I‚Äôm a doctor.

tcsm49,FIU: Perfect Medical School Run by Angels,"Dear Reddit community, 

There has been a lot of undeserved, false and horrendously unprofessional falsehoods levied against one of our nation's oldest and most prestigious medical schools: The FIU Herbert Wertheim School of Medicine. These unprofessional lies tarnish both our school's incredible reputation as well as that of our namesake, Dr. Herbert Wertheim, an outstanding optometrist physician.  I would like to share some information about our school to showcase how wonderful, happy and satisfied our medical students are and how nice and empathetic our staff are.

Our school is frequently described by our students, interviewees and alumni as a ""heaven on earth."" Everybody is content and happy, none of our students are stressed out, we have some of the nicest/most professional faculty out there, our administration is known internationally for how much they care about the medical students, we have no legal troubles, do not unfairly punish students (or punish students at all), and never silence the beautiful, angelic voices of our diverse students. In addition, all of our students are able to progress easily through all 4 years with no unfair delays in their education. Anything stating the contrary is FAKE. 

First and foremost, FIU prides itself on the happiness of and diversity of our medical school class. Check out these pictures of our happy, diverse medical students:

We also have the world's most beautiful campus: seen [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/36dScreenShot20220312at.png) as well as some of the most modern and most world class medical facilities seen [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/e82ScreenShot20220312at.png). 

Our faculty are known for their kind treatment of medical students. In fact, we've won INTERNATIONAL awards for how well we treat our students. See the prestigious award we've won [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/f60ScreenShot20220312at.png). 

We also frequently seek and respond to feedback from our students. 100% of the feedback we receive is positive. A sample of student comments can be found [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/a4cScreenShot20220312at.png). 

We have also NEVER publicly shamed a student; all allegations alleging the opposite are fake news. Also, none of our students are working for Uber or wait tables. 

Our school has been [praised](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/2cbScreenShot20220312at.png) by the LCME for how well it is run and for how amazing we are. 

Finally, there is a super fake version of a hearing transcript leaked by an unprofessional student. Here is the correct version! [Click here for the non-fake version of the transcript](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/146ScreenShot20220312at.png)

1n5xehy,First day med school and anxiety,"Hii,

I i just finished my first day in med school and i‚Äôm quite overwhelmed. I had to drop out of another program because I got depressed and burned out, and got to the point where I was having (passive!) suicidal thoughts. I just didn‚Äôt have any light left in me. 
I‚Äôm kind of reliving the same feelings but not as heavy as before. I think it‚Äôs my body recognising i‚Äôm in the same situation again as when i broke down (being in school, just starting with uni etc.). I‚Äôm scared that the same thing will happen again. Has anyone experienced the same or does anyone have some advice? I would really appreciate it

When i got accepted into med school i was depressed too. I didn‚Äôt feel any excitement. But i don‚Äôt think i would‚Äôve liked not getting in either hahaha.

I really enjoyed the content i learned today, so it‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt like medicine or anything. It‚Äôs just that my depression, anxiety and (apparently) fear of failure are getting in the way.

I don‚Äôt want to have to drop out again. I want to keep going. But it‚Äôs just that im sick, and i dont know how to get better. I contacted my study advisor but i have to wait 2 weeks to see them, so i thought maybe there are other people who went trough, or are going trough, the same thing. 

The first course is really chaotic and i don‚Äôt know what is expected of me. I don‚Äôt really get guided as well as i did in previous programs, and i feel really lost. It isn‚Äôt that i find the content difficult, but the way the course is structured; it‚Äôs all over the place. This doesn‚Äôt help with the stress and anxiety i was already feelingü•π

1df83q8,With regard to all those rigidly against rounding up,"I'm going to take a second and be critical of those of us who are proudly proclaiming that they assign a C+ if a student gets a 79.98, and they're a filthy grade grubber if they ask for anything else.

Even at their best, grading systems are somewhat arbitrary. I taught a ""hard science"" at the college level for about 15 years but I have been teaching in the humanities for the last 6. It's much easier to consistently grade a math derivation than a creative work, but there is a non-zero amount of flexibility in the former too.

Some thoughts that can give me pause about just how well I've made my grading scale: When I divide the work up, am I doing that in a fair way? Can someone still be pretty decent and get a D on my scale? Can they be pretty lousy and get a low A? I have always had to weigh what a certain grade level's work looks like, what a certain amount of effort looks like, and also whether I was doing my job well enough to get the outcomes I asked for. I have also given assignments that turned out to be much more work than I had intended or assignments where I didn't cover some vital aspect in class for whatever reason.

I also sometimes find that a student has lost points by my rubric, but in doing so has gotten closer to the outcome that I wanted. Sometimes students take risks, and those turn out badly. But if they are much more vigorously engaging in the process I want them to engage in, I am willing to consider that even if the outcome wasn't what either of us had hoped. The rubric should be a guidepost, not handcuffs.

And when I'm grading, am I tired? Hungry? Am I getting more annoyed because ""nobody is getting it"" and so the student whose name is last alphabetically is getting hit just a bit harder? Did I get through the entire class in one pass, or am I grading half of them in a slightly different frame of mind the next day? Is this the assignment of that one kid who continually disrupts the class, or the one who nods and insightfully answers questions? Is that making a difference in how I assign a grade? I think we all try to do what we can to make it fair and uniform, but it's an impossible task.

So that's a long-winded way of saying, yes grade grubbing sucks, and the requests can be completely insane. But just keep in mind that you've put together a system that is, at best, only ostensibly an utterly unbiased and fair measure of the work they've done. Are you really applying a level of fairness and uniformity to a precision of a tiny fraction of a percent? Really?

On the other hand, if you have an LMS that shows a student that they have a 79.4%, they have an extra credit assignment for an additional 1%, and they choose not to do it, then okay, you may be justified.

And I'm sorry, I know we're mostly massively overworked and underpaid, and that working with a student body that grows more stressed out, hopeless, and seems to be less mature each year sucks.

So my gender and skin color come into play for my specific experience because I‚Äôve never met anyone that looks like me that‚Äôs also struggling with ADHD. So I just felt alone and not seen.

So I have a lot of imposter syndrome, not thinking I‚Äôm good enough, etc. I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble managing my adhd and getting work done especially with burnout coming into play. And particularly as a black women it looks like a bad look for me to look unproductive because I could easily be seen as a stereotype. I‚Äôve tried with a couple therapists in the past to help me try and get more productive with the adhd but they weren‚Äôt helpful. 
That‚Äôs why I wanted to hear advice from other people so I can get a better idea of how to get through it.
But I also understand too other nonblack people might also deal with adhd issues as well in this journey.

1bj9rsw,Do I give up on this PhD?,"Hi everyone, 

I am in the 3rd year of my PhD (5 years if you include breaks/gaps) and I just feel exhausted and I have no idea what to do. I have two small children so I have taken gaps for Covid-19 and breaks when my baby got sick and was diagnosed with a condition. It has been a rough journey and what has got me through is having the most kind, supportive, and understanding supervisor. He has been so accommodating and I honestly do not feel worthy of his kindness and non-judgemental support. 

My PhD is in social sciences and I have 4 substantive chapters to write then my introduction and conclusion (70,000 words in total). I have written two of the substantive chapters and I am working on the remaining chapters. 

I feel like I cant do this anymore, I feel burned out and at the moment I am editing this 15,500 word chapter. It is chaotic and disorganised, it gives me anxiety just to open it so often I don't. I will scroll the internet, check emails, order stuff for my kids, cook their dinner, everything and anything before I sit down. On the one hand, I want to finish and prove to myself that despite experiencing the hardest 5 years of my life I did it. I want to set a good example for my kids and show them what mummy can do. I want to make the supervisor who has stood by me and believed in me when I didn't deserve it proud too. I truly want those things so why am I self-sabotaging? I keep telling myself if I cannot suck it up and do it then I do not deserve it at all. I feel so much anxiety, worry, and low self-worth. 

I do not know if anyone can relate but, I know what to do and I actually enjoy writing but what is painful is pushing through it. I feel this surge of cortisol and I don't even know what I afraid of but it feels like writing is what scares me. I am supposed to be writing now but I have just signed up to reddit and writing this post. I feel lost. 

I am not sure what I am even asking right now. Is there anyone who feels like this? What do you do to get past it? When do you know its time to give up? 

I sometimes feel like people like me cannot make it, I have two small kids one has special needs and I am on call for them for everything. I cook all their meals, take them to activities, do homework, therapy appointments, bedtime and everything else you can imagine that it takes to raise them. I love them with my whole heart but I just feel like pizza dough rolled so thin, I am rendered useless.

1kvf1s1,"Flunked final practicum in Masters 10 yrs ago, but passed all of the coursework","A few years ago, I was about to do the 4th and final practicum of a masters in rehabilitation sciences. I had passed the first 3 practicums (pass or fail). All of my graduate coursework was successfully completed - with A's and B's. A mix of group work and independent work. I was also working on the final thesis project with 2 other students, which we got an A+ on and presented at a symposium.

Unfortunately, i ended up flunking the final practicum. I was ashamed, embarrassed, sad, and stressed. I could give excuses saying my supervisor was uptight and we didn't vibe... I could also bring up my undiagnosed ADHD/PTSD... I was dealing with emotional abuse at home by a parent, and had just experienced a breakup of a 4 year engagement where we were living together... I was in love with him, but towards the end of the relationship, he was gaslighting me quite a bit (before the word gaslighting became a word that's thrown around!). The program was tough. Challenging. I had anxiety, depression, insomnia, ADHD.... 

Needless to say, I struggled. I suppose the criteria for the final practicum contained certain requirements that I could not meet. I remember them pointing them out to me and giving me a second chance. I tried another practicum at another location with another supervisor. Embarrassingly, I flunked that, too.

They ended up kicking me out of the program, denying me the master's despite having taken thousands of dollars of tuition from me over the course of the 2 academic years, and despite me having passed all of my coursework with flying Colors. I know I somehow did not pass the practicums but they seemed quite heartless and uncaring, not bothering to see if there‚Äôs another way I could succeed, considering I‚Äôd just passed all the courses and the other practicums. Not taking the time to find out what‚Äôs going on with me. 

Do you think the university failed its institutional responsibility ? I feel like universities have a duty of care to support students, especially in challenging circumstances. The fact that I was cut off without support and no remediation or understanding points to a failure on their part to adequately fulfill that duty. 

They neither understood nor explored why I was struggling (trauma, undiagnosed ADHD, etc.). I believe they should‚Äôve offered meaningful, trauma-informed support during that period. They also should‚Äôve given me a real chance to succeed ‚Äî not just a re-do, but support structures to make that re-do fair.  There zero attempt at repair or follow-up after my dismissal, I was just cut off after failing the re-do of the 2nd practicum.

Shouldn‚Äôt a university ‚Äî especially one preparing people for caring professions ‚Äî be asking: ‚ÄúWhat happened to this student?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid we give her what she needed to succeed?‚Äù
‚ÄúIf we failed to do that, what‚Äôs our responsibility now?‚Äù Or am I completely out of my mind? 

I spoke to the Ombudsperson a month or 2 after, but it did no good. I tried to appeal the decision to no avail. I was exhausted and dejected. 

I fell into a shame spiral after this‚Ä¶ it was awful. The fact that I wasn‚Äôt failing in general just makes this outcome so severe. No degree granted to me, despite having completed the program‚Äôs academic core, with good grades. Should a practicum failure really nullify two years of successful graduate-level work?
	
What are your thoughts on this, and has anyone ever experienced something like this? If so, what happened/what did you do? I am thinking of reaching back out to the school. Do you think that‚Äôs futile? In my angriest moments, I even thought about seeking legal counsel and suing the university. i know that‚Äôs dramatic and maybe irrational. 

But this institutional decision had disproportionate and lifelong consequences on me, and I felt like I was kicked to the curb.

I‚Äôm also thinking of applying to another, similar program that might be a better fit for me, and seeing if I can use some of the courses I completed in this program as transfer credits. I don‚Äôt wish to take graduate-level stats more than once!
Thanks in advance for your input.

74lqf1,"Reflections of Someone with More Than Three ""Red Flags"" on Her Application","I had numerous shortcomings in medical school. I was clearly not the ideal applicant. I did everything to increase my chances of getting into residency: worked hard my third year, emphasized my strengths in my application, and applied broadly. I applied somewhere between 120-150 family medicine programs, ended up with 21 interview offers, and went on 17. I matched to my #4 program.

How I got my ""red flags"":

* I failed my cardiology module after developing anxiety in my first semester of medical school. I could not cope with my failure and fell into depression. I chose to stay in denial about my situation. I refused all help.
* I missed Step 1 by one point. This was my breaking point. Eventually, I sought treatment and asked for extra help in school. My grades improved during MS3. I recovered enough of my knowledge deficits to perform slightly below average on Step 2. 
* I passed my Step 1 retake by only *one* point. I did not have significant improvement compared to my first score.
* I postponed graduation by one year while I figured out personal and family issues.

If anyone suffered from imposter syndrome, it's definitely me. I constantly wondered why any residency program even considered me for an interview. I realized on interviews that programs want residents who persevere. This is even more of a reality as my program director and attendings review applications right now. They constantly remind us that applicants who are familiar with adversity are preferred over ones who had it easy their whole life. My advice is this: do not shy away from your shortcomings or ""red flags."" Take responsibility, and explain how you changed for the better.

I am writing this because it is important for people who struggled to speak up. I strongly believe speaking up is one way to better the culture of medicine so others will not feel isolated. We are all imperfect people, and we all have our limitations. It is important to recognize those limitations, and to figure out how to overcome them.

I am currently a PGY-1 in a family medicine residency. None of my co-interns know about my past. When I am rotating through an off-service rotation, none of the attendings care about my Step scores. What matters now is the quality of my work and my willingness to work. First year of residency is tough. It is certainly harder than medical school. On the bad days, I recall the worst day of my life and remind myself - if I can get through that, then I can overcome anything.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/74lqf1/reflections_of_someone_with_more_than_three_red/
1hx0c8b,"One of my least favorite emails: ""What did I miss?""","Seriously we've just started back and had only one class and I'm getting emails from a few students who want me to summarize everything from 1st day because they weren't there and hoped it was just reviewing the syllabus. Yes, we do a lot of time on the syllabus because none of them actually read it but aIso assigned a non-credit assignment (just a video prompt to get them thinking about the concepts we'll work through for the rest of term). Sent the student the link and that was it. 

I have to agree with all the posters who are feeling tired, dispirited. I love teaching and 85-90% of the students are an absolute joy. The rest suck all of the energy out of the room. Energy Vampires for those who watch the TV series.

I've been doing this for almost 30 years and am eligible for early retirement but have to say that it's administrators and the corporatization of the university that made my decision. This new academia is not academia. As someone famous once said: ""the past is a foreign country.""

I really love medicine and I am pretty devastated that this is probably the end for.
Unfortunately, I was just few decimal away from passing my last term of 1st year, but the school is very strict and said I have failed. There is no remediation and I will be dismissed. 


I am actually on a repeat year because I went on leave of absence last year due to mental health issues. I was passing all my classes until two months ago, my grade plummeted badly. This is when I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder (on top of already existing PTSD and anxiety)  which I believe contributed a lot on why I struggled. Now I am unsure what I should go for and what would be a good plan B. 


I am pretty lost now.. I'd really like some advice on what would be an alternative to medical school. I really love medicine, and I am in tears. I definitely love the medical field and just STEM in general. I considered Physician assistant, but seems like many programs are really particular about their requirements, which I don't have because I graduated undergrad long time ago.


One of my friend did suggest that maybe I should reapply to another school (but I doubt anyone wants me with my F) or at least go to a Caribbean medical school. I am already in so much debt and I know how cutthroat Caribbean medschools are, so I don't think it's a good idea.

I know I do not want to go for teaching or research because I've done them before medical school and didn't like it. 
All I have is a bachelor degree in Biology. If you have any advice or suggestion on other careers in STEM that would be good for someone who likes medicine, I'd really appreciate it..!


+++++++++++

EDIT: Hello everyone. Firstly, thank you for your response. I was overwhelmed by how many encouraging messages I've received here. It's been difficult, but all your responses gave me hope. I appreciate all the help..!

I ended up doing a request for appeal as my last resort. They still denied giving me a Pass, but thank goodness I was granted a remediation course this summer. I'll do all my best!  If I do fail, I'll accept it and take other career paths to consideration, which many of you had great suggestions. 

Thank you for creating such a supportive community here. I also hope that whatever you guys do, I hope you succeed! Goodbye for now üòä",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/143xb7p/dismissed_from_medical_school_i_need_advice_please/
8scqtt,[Residency]Why you should do Diagnostic Radiology- Resident's perspective,"Background: I‚Äôm a soon to be chief resident (PGY-4, 3rd year radiology for another week) at a mid tier academic program in a big city. Traditional route med student who didn‚Äôt know they wanted to do rads until the beginning of 3rd year. Love the field and think there‚Äôs a lot of misconception among med students of what it entails. Recently finished boards and have been meaning to do a write up for those interested (or undecided) about radiology.

&nbsp;

**Radiology years:**

&nbsp;

* PGY-1: Intern year- can do a preliminary medicine, surgery or transitional year. Do the easiest thing you can, and if it‚Äôs in the same city as your advanced, sweet.
* PGY-2: Radiology R1- The ACGME says 1st year residents can‚Äôt take call, making this possible the easiest year on your entire training hours wise. You will be overwhelmed by a completely new way of looking at medicine, but you won‚Äôt work nights or any (or very many) weekends. You should be studying to prepare you for‚Ä¶.
* PGY-3: Radiology R2- The hardest year of residency work wise. Very call heavy. I worked almost 3 months of night float, and more weekends than I can count. However, this is still better than what people in a surgical or medicine residency go through! 
* PGY-4: Radiology R3- Boards. So radiology does this weird thing where you take a monstrous CORE exam at the end of this year, which is actually only a ‚ÄúBoard Certifying exam‚Äù.  It‚Äôs incredibly difficult, requires months of preparation, with a 80-90% pass rate (but remember, this is a group of nerds with a Step average of 240+ you compete against). There‚Äôs an annoying physics section. Time ‚Äúoff‚Äù to study is variable per program, but you will be studying several hours a day starting in the winter. The actual ‚Äúradiology boards‚Äù is taken 18 months after residency (during your actual job), and is a joke with close to 100% pass rate. Most programs also allow residents to go to Washington DC for a month (paid for) for AIRP, a radiology pathology lecture course. It‚Äôs like being a med student with no responsibilities and no tests for a month. Great for those who don‚Äôt have a family to leave behind.  
You will also apply to fellowship this year. Most fellowships are going towards a match (except Body, Chest), and you will apply and interview second half of the year.. Annoyingly during boards prep time. You also find out where you match a couple days after you take boards. Vast majority of fellowships are 1 year, and everyone does one.
* PGY-5: Radiology R4- Boards behind you and majority of call behind you. Most programs let you dictate your schedule, with ‚Äúmini fellowships‚Äù of 4-6 months in your subspecialty of choice. Usually in something to compliment what your actual fellowship is in.

&nbsp;

**Typical day:**

&nbsp;

An example of a typical day of a resident on a diagnostic rotation, such as Musculoskeletal.

8:00 AM Arrive and start ‚Äúdictating‚Äù the studies on the list, which would be plain extremity x-rays or MRIs (knees, shoulders etc) depending on your seniority. This involves dictating a preliminary report of the study, that won‚Äôt go out until the attending reviews it.

9:00 AM Go perform a joint injection (fluoroscopic guided hip or shoulder injections mostly, for steroid and pre-MRI arthrogram).  These occur anywhere from 2-5x a day, and usually take 15-30 minutes depending how fast you are. You do all the set up and the attending will come to watch when you‚Äôre actually injecting.

10:30-Noon Go ‚Äúsign out‚Äù the studies (xrays, MRIs) you‚Äôve read with the attending.  This is usually sitting next to them while they look over the study and your reports, going over findings and occasionally pimping you.

Noon-1pm: Conference, half are pure didactic and half are case based. Radiology makes it really easy to have a hundred images of different pathologies and going around the room having residents work through them/answer.  Radiology is also much heavier on conferences than other specialties, averaging around 5 hours a week in most programs.  This will go way up for R3s during board studying time.

1pm-5pm: Repeat of the morning

&nbsp;

Other diagnostic rotations would include Neuroradiology, Ultrasound, Body CT, MRI, Breast etc and they all have their own procedures including lumbar punctures, myelograms, thyroid biopsies, breast biopsies etc. There are a lot of procedures outside IR, something I wasn‚Äôt aware of before residency. This varies by institution however.

&nbsp;

**Call:** Overall hours wise as a resident you will not be there that long unless call is involved.  Call schedules vary so much among programs that saying mine won‚Äôt really help, but R2 year is the busiest with around 1-2 months of night float, and 10-15 weekend day coverage. Radiology doesn‚Äôt have separate residents on for different specialties for call (such as a MICU night float, cardiology night float etc) so at most you will have 1-2 residents in the hospital covering ANYTHING radiology related. This includes for us 

1. Dictating every study done on hospital inpatients (minus ICU chest xrays), everything coming through the ED & multiple satellite urgent cares. A car crash with 4 passengers at once? You‚Äôll have 4 CT Chest abdomen pelvis, CT Heads, CT c-spines and an xray of every extremity that hurts on your list at once, with the ED calling you asking for results. It‚Äôs overwhelming and exhilarating (for some)

2. Answer calls/pages for anything radiology related, including review studies with surgeons on call, questions about what to order etc. 

3. Performing any diagnostic radiology procedures, including: septic joint aspirations that need fluoroscopy (hips), fluoroscopy guided lumbar punctures, esophagrams for perforations, intussusception reductions. 

4. Fielding IR consults, meaning gathering all the info, consenting, calling in the team and IR attending to perform it. Sometimes we scrub in on these but usually the diagnostic part is so busy we can‚Äôt. Some programs with bigger IR sections will have fellows on call to handle this.

Call as a resident is always in house, you will probably never sleep. It is very different that how other specialties handle call. A busier call lets us enjoy a lighter regular schedule.

&nbsp;

I love radiology as a field, and try to convince every med student to do it. Here‚Äôs some reasons why:

&nbsp;

**Pure medicine, no BS:**
I believe the 2 big reasons someone pursues medicine are the humanitarian aspect and the science aspect. I leaned towards the latter, and most people I‚Äôve encountered in radiology are the same. My biggest gripe about intern year was how little medicine you do. Pretty much all the data gathering and analysis, including differential for a service could be done in an hour, but you spend the remaining 12 hours calling consults to regurgitate information, call social services, and essentially act as a secretary. This obviously reduces are you become more senior, but hospitalists still do this. Radiology is just you and a study, trying to get information out of it. Non-compliant patient with crazy abscess? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes and told the clinician, now it‚Äôs their problem trying to get him to take antibiotics. Diabetic with necrotic pancreatitis? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes, and wash my hands.  You can help so many people, so fast, because you are just doing medicine. Never have to deal with insurance issues, getting someone in a nursing home, trying to get a consult to see a patient. Never have to deal with getting ‚Äúdumped on‚Äù at 5pm, because even if a MRI comes on the list at 4:59? I‚Äôll read it in 10-15 minutes, vs an hour admitting a new patient.  


This gets me to the next point: **You control your own pace.**  There are no nurses you are waiting to get labs, no attending sleeping at home you‚Äôre trying to get to round (we do have attendings that read out studies slower than others, but magnitudes less painful than rounds, and this disappears when you‚Äôre an attending yourself). You don‚Äôt have to wait for pancreatitis to resolve to discharge a patient, you just sign the study and you‚Äôre on the next one. Never have a million checkboxes to do for the day, just clicking on study at a time (with procedures thrown in).


**Interacting with colleagues more than patients:** If you love patient interactions, radiology is probably not for you. However, you can still be plenty social in radiology. The only difference is you just spend the entire day talking to coworkers (who are in the same rooms as you) and a bunch of consulting clinicians. I really enjoy talking to clinicians about studies and reviewing them, as opposed to a patient who doesn‚Äôt know anything about their care. A perfect medium would be the ability to just review studies with patients who are interested, but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to be a billable code anytime soon. 


Finally: **It‚Äôs like learning a new language.** Every service thinks they can read their own studies (and some can), but vast majority of clinicians have no clue beyond a basic xray.  I still remember telling a pulmonology fellow, when I was an R1, that the pneumothorax he was worried about was just a skin fold. Even early in your training, your abilities will surpass that of attendings in other fields and it feels‚Ä¶ awesome. To have someone call with a study saying ‚ÄúI have no idea whats going on‚Äù and you know what it is 2 seconds in, is a great feeling. This feeling will only get exemplified in private practice, where everyone is more reliant on radiology.

&nbsp;

So how do you know if radiology is right for you? Here a some characteristics I think that may be a sign that it‚Äôs for you.


**You liked the first 2 years of med school more than the 3rd year.**  I was miserable 3rd year, because most specialties have the social work mentioned above, and you‚Äôre never in control of your own time. Even intern year was better, but I didn‚Äôt really ever enjoy coming to work till I started radiology residency. I have a great social life, but I really enjoy coming to work and just having it be me and my work, with some interactions with colleagues. It‚Äôs very similar to studying a bunch the first 2 years (with more free time).


**You are organized/efficient.** The people I see struggling most in radiology are those who are slow. This does not mean they make bad radiologist, on the contrary, I would want a slow methodical radiologist to read my scans. But to be able to keep up with the pace that the field demands and enjoy it, you have to have some sense of speed. Being a techy is also related somewhat, but we‚Äôre definitely a minority even in radiology.


**You do not have an ego.** Radiologist will get shit on by every speciality, ‚Äúclinically correlate‚Äù etc etc, and some specialties such as ortho or neurosurgery will pretend you don‚Äôt exist. But you have to be ok with not being in the front seat of patient care, and making contributions behind the scenes.

**You are a good test taker.** Radiology is essentially one big test. Staring at the screen, coming to an answer. This will also help with the CORE exam..

&nbsp;

Dismissing some misconceptions about radiology:


**AI-** I‚Äôve literally never heard a radiologist bring this up as a viable threat. We are 20+ years from this making any significant impact, and when it does, it‚Äôll just make our lives easier. We‚Äôll have a 50% unemployment rate from machines before radiologists are actually put out of jobs. Do not worry about it.


**Outsourcing-** Also not a real threat. Clinicians want to talk to their radiologists, which is why not every radiologist is a teleradiologist. There‚Äôs a handful than get US board certified and go overseas to read US studies, but this is so rare that it‚Äôs a non-issue (and doesn‚Äôt save that much money). Teleradiology is definitely a big thing (reading studies from states away), but is seen as a last resort by most due to poor compensation.

&nbsp;


Some real downsides to the field:


**You will work hard.** Attending radiology is not a cush 40 hour work week. This exists in some settings (VA especially), but most are pushing 50-60 hours, with 10+ hour days. These days are BUSY, reading studies and doing procedures non-stop. If you want to have a lot of downtime at work, radiology is not for you. To make up for this, most private practices offer 8-12 weeks of vacation, which can only happen because we have no continuity of care to worry about. Working harder for the same amount of pay is universal in medicine however.


**You always have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù.** You can have a bad day as a hospitalist, maybe half-ass some physical exams and be ok, but if you half-ass some studies, I guarantee you‚Äôll hear about the cancer you missed on the chest x-ray in a few years. Majority of my misses as a resident have been when I‚Äôve been pushing myself to read faster than I should, or was in a hurry to finish. Radiology is unforgiving.


**Attending life is harder than resident life.** As above, your hours get worse (no nights though, that's usually taken care of a hired nighthawk service) and days more stressful because of all the litigation risk, but the pay and vacation are there for that. I‚Äôm sure med students are very interested in pay, but I don‚Äôt have information that can‚Äôt be found online (see doximity compensation report). Of note, the regional variation is huge and you can make family med money in downtown of a big city vs surgical subspecialty money by going rural.

&nbsp;

Hope that helps. I feel like the whole application process and score averages have changed since I applied so not sure how much help I can be of that, but some things: Step 1 is big, research isn‚Äôt really (I had nothing). The tier of program only matters if you want to do academics, location is way more important for connections.

I posted this a few days back while upset, and got downvoted within seconds, so I took it down. Posting again as I need to own my feelings on this. 

I‚Äôve recently discovered that my courses will be fully online for 2020-2021. 

To provide some context: I have two part-time, pro rata contracts in two colleges, one with an extremely heavy teaching load.  The latter institution already has full-time expectations of part-timers‚Äô availability, making it a stressful post.  Pre-pandemic I was on the verge of quitting  because of serious workload vs pay concerns but now, while eternally grateful to still have a job, I‚Äôm stuck.

The thought of having to teach online for a full year, with the doubled (in my experience, at least) workload, new courses and associated stress, has me freaking out. I‚Äôm not certain I can manage it, either in terms of performing my duties adequately or maintaining my physical or mental health (both of which I struggle with, even in ordinary circumstances). After years of effort to keep myself from relapse following a mental health crisis, and just about succeeding, I‚Äôm worried that this is going to be the straw to break the camel‚Äôs back. I have just about managed these past two months, running on fumes, with the summer on the horizon keeping me going - I‚Äôm not sure if I could do this for an entire academic year, with no respite or promise of an approaching light at the end of the tunnel. I will have to put in huge work over the summer to design new courses and update old ones for online delivery, but as I‚Äôm on a 9-month contract I will be doing it unpaid. While I love what I do, I can‚Äôt afford to work for free - I need to do other work during the summer to tide me over financially. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting - I‚Äôm just filled with dread and despair looking at the year ahead and have a strong desire to run for the hills, although that‚Äôs neither an option for me nor something I‚Äôd ever inflict on my similarly-beleaguered colleagues!

I guess I thought y‚Äôall would understand the struggle.  I‚Äôm far from work-shy, but as a human I have physical, mental (and temporal!) limitations. I‚Äôm worried that next year is going to be hell. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for being so negative - I think I probably just need a hug!!

1kx0rop,Does a PhD ever end? I‚Äôm exhausted,"I‚Äôm going into my sixth year of my PhD, and honestly, I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep going.

My advisors just keep piling on more and more tasks, even though I‚Äôm no longer getting paid for the PhD and it‚Äôs no longer my full-time focus. I‚Äôm completely burned out trying to juggle research with my current job. For the past six months, I‚Äôve been stuck trying to get a single experiment to work, and nothing moves forward. To make it worse, now the lab has run out of funding and my supervisor still tries to push things forward even without the bare minimum. Last week we didn‚Äôt even have fetal bovine serum, so I couldn‚Äôt continue my cell cultures and lost (once again) at least a month of work.

I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm tired of restarting experiments over and over again. I‚Äôm tired of giving up my weekends. I have some results. I don‚Äôt even know if they‚Äôre ‚Äúenough,‚Äù or if they‚Äôre what my supervisors were expecting. But they‚Äôre what I have and honestly, I don‚Äôt believe in the project anymore.

I started my PhD at the beginning of the pandemic. I worked with human patient samples, so it was horrible to do anything during covid. I lost my brother in my first year of PhD and just swallowed my grief to keep going. I‚Äôve kept pushing and sacrificing through everything and now honestly I just want this chapter of my life to be over.

But I don‚Äôt know how to end it. Every time I try to set boundaries or push to wrap things up, I feel like I‚Äôm not taken seriously. I don‚Äôt feel respected or that my work is good enough to proceed with the defense. I passed my qualifying exam with no reservations and I could defend if my supervisor didn‚Äôt keep insisting on more and more results‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm stuck between guilt, burnout, and fear of ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù.

1igw18x,"Drained, Depressed, Dog-tired and Demotivated. Please no negativity or harmful comments. I am struggling mentally.","Just defended my qualifying exams, but I feel completely drained. Where do I go from here? I‚Äôm a third-year PhD student, and I just passed my qualifying exams (with minor revisions). I should feel relieved, maybe even proud‚Äîbut instead, I feel exhausted, bitter, and completely lost.

Grad school has been brutal, and not just in the ""science is hard"" kind of way. The institution I‚Äôm in has taken a serious toll on me mentally, and right now, I‚Äôm sick in bed, trying to hold on with some glimmer of hope. I do not know if I should stay tough it out, drop and master out, or take a semester off to think.

At the start, I was genuinely excited about my research. I saw so many biological connections in my project, and it reignited my passion for science. My PI hadn‚Äôt had a PhD student in over a year, so I took the initiative‚Äîreading dozens of papers, brainstorming ways to expand our work, and even mapping out techniques and costs. When I brought my ideas to him, he shut them down completely. Not only did he reject everything, but he told me to stop thinking about biology altogether. That crushed me. I had spent so much time building a deeper understanding of our work and coming up with ways to enhance it, only to be dismissed like my ideas didn‚Äôt matter.  A ""friend"" (who isn‚Äôt really a friend anymore) told me I should just accept it, saying maybe it was a funding issue or that my PI needed to focus on his current grant. So, I swallowed my excitement and moved on. It stung like hell. Like salt to a wound.

Then, things got worse. A master‚Äôs student joined the lab, and at first, we were close. But by May, everything turned toxic. Out of nowhere, she started verbally harassing me‚Äîyelling at me, cursing me out in the lab office for no reason. It wasn‚Äôt a one-time thing either. It happened multiple times. I brought it up with my PI, and his response? ""She was probably just having a bad day. She was raised differently than you."" He refused to address it and said it was on me to fix the situation. She did it again. Several times throughout the summer and fall semesters. Screaming and cursing at me, calling me hostile, and somehow convincing my PI to take her side. When I got the department involved (GAR and chairperson), nothing really changed. She backed off, but all that came of it was my PI posting a weak ""respect each other"" note on the lab door.

On top I want to mention that this PI is a 50-year-old man who has made my experience here a nightmare. It‚Äôs not just that he rejects my ideas‚Äîhe actively insults me in front of the entire lab.

During group meetings, he constantly compares me to his undergraduate students and undermining me saying things like:

""X (senior) can explain this topic to you since you do not know this.""-He flirts with this girl constantly.

""You are not passionate in your work.""-I spend 12 hours a day in lab and I even came in on the weekends and Sundays after church.

""Why did you take molecular spectroscopy? That is a useless course""-mind you my work and theory deals with all of that and he recommended me to take a course that has no bearing on my current work.

It‚Äôs humiliating. I‚Äôm a PhD student, and he talks to me like I‚Äôm incompetent, like I‚Äôm beneath the undergrads he supervises.

And speaking of undergrads, his behavior around them is... unsettling. He flirts with them‚Äîconstantly making comments with a weird sexual undertone. He goes out of his way to be charming and overly friendly with the young women in the lab, always lingering around them, making inappropriate jokes, or giving them unnecessary compliments about their looks. It‚Äôs disgusting and appalling. And yet, he has the nerve to treat me like I‚Äôm some kind of burden. I have not brought these issues up with anyone because I am tired and I do not know if anyone will buy what I say, since other people in the lab seem to be seeing nothing wrong with it.

I feel like the black sheep of my lab. Group meetings are unbearable. I know grad school is tough, and maybe he thinks this will ""make me a better scientist,"" but for two years, I‚Äôve felt nothing but unsupported and dismissed. I‚Äôm exhausted.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. How do you push through when you feel like you‚Äôre barely holding on? I cried all last night to my partner. I really want to give up and master out, but a part of me wants to continue to make myself proud. I really want my degree and I really enjoy chemistry, but all this shit I have mentioned here has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.

I have been contemplating on whether or not if I should draft an email to the GAR about my concerns and how I am really demotivated in this lab. This PI i have does not even seem open to the idea of possibly collaborating (EVEN in the SAME DEPT). I need a challenge and my brain thirsts for knowledge, I wish I could collaborate with someone at this point, I would feel like my potential to be put to use.

P.S I want to also mention that I have my BS in Biochemistry and my MS in Molecular Biology. I wanted to be a medical doctor at first, but that changed for me when I did research. I realized I wanted to do a PhD instead because I was always curious about the things I was learning at hand and I really want to do something in genetic editing tying chemistry with it someday.

1e0bz07,I've Had Enough,"I'm sorry for posting a shitty downer rant. It just feels a little better to write all this down.

I genuinely feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. I just started M3 year. Barely passing clerkships (my school starts them early, I've had four so far). No friends at school. Spend every weekend alone. Every research project I was on tanked. Struggle to work out twice a week. Feel miserable constantly. Unhappy and anxiety ridden daily. Only multiple-day strectches I've felt happy in the past year have been 1) the week I visited home 2) the week I visited my college town 300+ miles away. Have had many days, weeks, and at one point a whole month where I was genuinely, clinically depressed. Nobody cares enough to ask how I'm doing and actually listen if I express even an ounce of doubt in myself or the circumstances.

I try to hope that residency will be better but I'm even losing that after hearing ""yOu tHiNk iT's hArD noW JuSt wAiT for rEsIdEnCy"" every single day from higher ups.

I want to match into psychiatry, but it's so competitive now. Dreading residency rejection or STEP failure but I'm simultaneously, secretly, wanting it so I can finally stop kidding myself and leave medicine. At least twice a week I'll stop in disbelief, reflecting on the fact that I left a career in tech just so I could ruin my life pretending to be a doctor.

""Take a leave of absence""

""See a therapist""

""Try a new hobby""

""Go make friends! Host an event!""

""Treat yourself""

All tried and failed, or cost money that I don't have. Medical school is a wash, praying I survive this and life somehow radically changes afterwards but I doubt that more every day.

Edit: Y'all I am overwhelmed by the positivity and support in comments and in DMs. I assumed 99% of reddit posts get ignored and didn't expect a couple dozen folks to hop on my digital diary. The comradery, advice, and encouragement actually made me feel miles better today. Thanks to you all, and good luck future doctors!

Edit2: Update for anyone who finds this post later (or those who come back to it, for whatever reason). I've really been riding the emotional waves the past couple months, but things are looking better. I just got my first two interview offers for residency and passed the FM shelf. After hitting these milestones, taking more time to work out, going to bed earlier, and binging Bojack Horseman: I've been able to back away from the ledge and am feeling a lot better. **You all were right: it DOES get better**. It gets better faster when you adjust your attitude/outlook, too. It took me two years to realize how much harder school has been because of my bad attitude. Keep working hard and reach out to others when you're feeling overwhelmed (this post, for instance, wound up being a huge morale booster for me).  **However, don't let yourself wallow. It is truly a waste of time.** ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1e0bz07/ive_had_enough/

1mmtm88,First year of med school and I already feel burnt out‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve just started my medical journey, and I‚Äôm already tired.
I spent two whole years just to clear the MCAT. Now that I‚Äôm finally in med school‚Ä¶ I kind of hate it.

Homesickness doesn‚Äôt help either.

I‚Äôve always been more into creativity. Here, everything is about cramming. Even when I find topics interesting, the interest disappears the moment it‚Äôs time to memorize everything for exams.

There‚Äôs barely any time left for hobbies or fun.
24 hours feels too short to do everything. And if I miss a day‚Äôs work, it feels impossible to catch up which just sucks.

I hate going to uni because it feels like a waste of time; I hardly understand my teachers, though YouTube helps a lot.

I don‚Äôt even know what I want anymore. My whole life, I‚Äôve had to put in double the effort because I‚Äôm not naturally gifted. Now I don‚Äôt want to live my life like this forever.

Whenever exam season comes, I get super stressed. I start having anxiety and I can‚Äôt stop crying.
I‚Äôm crying while writing this.

In my country, our year is divided into 3 blocks (each around 3‚Äì4 months). We have almost 3 tests in each block. Whenever these tests come, I take so much tension.

I barely passed the previous block. I don‚Äôt even remember what I studied in it.
And I know at the end of the year, I won‚Äôt remember each and everything either.

The worst part is, I know I‚Äôll have to put in double the effort not just for the next 5 years, but also for the USMLE because I‚Äôve always dreamed of going to the USA. Just thinking about working so much for 5+ years feels overwhelming.

Right now, I just feel like a failure.
Sometimes I wish I hadn‚Äôt cleared MCAT the second time, so maybe I could have moved on (though I‚Äôm not sure I would have).

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.
I feel like my mind is going to burst any minute now.

If anyone has been through this stage of med school and found a way to cope  or if you have advice on how to manage the stress, homesickness, and constant workload please share. I‚Äôm really looking for ways to make this journey feel more sustainable.

1k5dfgg,Autistic medical student - would IM residency make me miserable?,"I'm an MS3 trying to decide between applying IM and Pathology. I find pathology relatively interesting and love the idea of the path lifestyle, but am worried that I don't feel that true spark of liking the field or will miss seeing patients later on. If I do IM, my primary interest is in heme/onc (or maybe just benign heme). 

I was diagnosed with autism as an adult about 5 years ago. I've always had trouble with reading social cues (accidentally interrupting people, saying something insensitive, not knowing how to respond to people being witty or sarcastic, etc), and with fidgeting/stimming (stretching, cracking knuckles, picking at my nails, etc). Obviously I try to stop myself from doing these things during clinical rotations, but sometimes they slip out. My evals are generally good, but occasionally I rub someone the wrong way and get something like ""She could be more socially aware,"" etc. Basically, Dr. Mel King from The Pitt TV show reminded me of myself in a clinical setting. 

I have a love/hate relationship with seeing patients in the hospital or clinic. On one hand, it feels great when I do connect with people, and it's exciting to apply knowledge to real cases, discuss patients during rounds, etc. In the hospital I feel more focused and interested in what I'm doing. But, I get anxious when going to rotations every morning and before I walk into a patient's room. I sometimes feel overwhelmed and lost when people give me instructions on how to do something (especially something physical with my hands) and it takes me longer to process/understand it. I'm exhausted from the effort of acting normal after every day working in a clinical setting, with little energy to devote to my husband, dog, or hobbies. Idk, maybe that part will get better with experience. 

I'm afraid that IM residency will be even harder/worse than med school clinical rotations in these respects. It's like IM residency is a barrier to get through before I can do heme. (Maybe just benign heme so I don't have to break the news of cancer to patients?)I wonder if I should do pathology, even if I find it a little less interesting than heme/onc, just because the residency sounds a lot less stressful for someone with autism and might not push me to the very limits like IM residency would. 

TL/DR: any thoughts on the feasibility of IM residency for someone with autism?

Theory of Automata (TOA)

Operating Systems (OS) + Lab

Database Systems (DB) + Lab

Computer Networks (CN) + Lab

Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Total: 18 credit hours

‚ùì Questions:

How did you manage your time across theory + 3 labs?

Any tips to study smart, not just hard?

What helped you crack TOA proofs or understand Algorithms better?

Best resources (YouTube, PDFs, websites) for each course?

What mistakes should I absolutely avoid?

How did you avoid burnout in a heavy semester like this?

1h5pwrr,"Passed My Viva with Minor Corrections, but I Feel Like a Fraud","Hi everyone,

I just had my Viva last week and technically passed with minor corrections. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be over the moon, but honestly, I feel completely torn to shreds. Instead of relief, I‚Äôm overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy, like I‚Äôve been handed this PhD for the sake of everyone else‚Äôs convenience rather than my own merit.

**A Bit of Background:**

My PhD journey has been rough. Like many, COVID threw a wrench into my plans, but on top of that, I‚Äôve dealt with significant mental health struggles and caring for sick parents. My project started out as computational genetics-focused, but due to various obstacles (including my own struggles), it evolved into a broader, more basic epidemiological study. On paper, it had breadth‚Äîlots of different analyses‚Äîbut from my perspective, it lacked depth and originality.

My supervisor insisted I had more than enough for a PhD, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that she was just being kind, given everything I was going through. Deep down, I hated my project and felt ashamed of my work, spending my entire PhD battling the feeling of not being good enough.

During my PhD I went from being someone who was curious, hard-working and somewhat smart, to being extremely disorganised (missing deadlines), lacked any motivation to learn and seemed to have unlearned everything I knew.

**The Viva:**

One examiner was gentle, while the other was...direct. They seemed frustrated with me/the work. They pushed for more XYZ analysis. I blanked on some questions that I really should have known the answer to, which made me feel even worse. There were moments where it felt like they missed parts of my work or contradicted what journal reviewers had told me to remove (my work isn‚Äôt published yet btw, it‚Äôs under review). I‚Äôm not someone who is defensive or precious about my work, so if I‚Äôm given criticism I‚Äôll normally agree with it. There were a couple of moments where I felt like I wanted to cry.¬†

At the end of it, I walked out feeling stupid, expecting major corrections or even a revise-and-resubmit verdict. The only reason I got minor corrections was because Examiner 1 convinced Examiner 2 to ease up. I can see their points, and in a way, I agree with their critiques. But instead of feeling relief, I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve the PhD and certainly not my post-doc position.

**Where I‚Äôm At Now:**

I was offered a post-doc (in the same department) before my Viva, but I feel like quitting. I don‚Äôt believe I have the skills for data analysis, bioinformatics, in any type of academia/industry job. I‚Äôm exhausted, mentally drained, and lacking any resilience. All I want to do is hide away and cry. I'm finding it so hard to face everyone congratulating me.

I know this sounds dramatic since it‚Äôs ""just minor corrections,"" but I genuinely believe my PhD was handed to me for others' sake‚Äîmy supervisor‚Äôs reputation, departmental harmony, collaborations etc.

I mostly needed to vent, but has anyone felt similar? Has anyone pivoted completely from their PhD? Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.¬†

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you to all. Whilst my self-esteem is probably shattered (obvs my own issues in there combined with academic life), I'm trying to finish up and move on.

1ksxdpk,How much research is enough research? HELP,"How much research is enough research?

I am coming out of autistic burnout after my first year of Ma grad school, and now my coursework is behind me and i finally have a topic!

I'm supposed to be buckling down and putting together background research to use with my data in developing my dissertation proposal and my dissertation in general. 

I was initially ecstatic to finally be able to set my own pace but I am now finding i don't know what a normal pace or acceptable pace is. I already told my advisor I am absolutely not expecting to get this done in the normal two year interval but they also don't want me to take too long and I am stressing out about my slow progress. 

When i first started in uni i remember plowing through several articles a week and churning out assignments but a) i seem not to have the attention span needed right now and b) i'm not really able to make myself skim now that it is a topic i am really invested in. 

I seem to retreat into burnout and become catatonic over the weekends if i put in more than 3 days a week,  (which is not good because i still have a house to maintain and three kids) but also i can't seem to put in more than maybe 3 solid hours in on a good day. 

Is this what it's like once you get down to your specific topic? Is this still burnout and it will get better? Am i expecting too much out of myself? I have no way to gauge this...

on my official transcript, it says i got a B- in this class but during finals week, i had 100% on blackboard. no late or missing assignments. no absences. 100% on every assignment with positive comments. the only thing that wasn't graded yet was a final writing portfolio but i had already received 100% on the drafts for each part of this so i doubt i failed it. 

i don't know what to do. i emailed my professor, the department chair, and the dean earlier this week. no responses from anyone. this was my last semester before student teaching (which is pass/fail), and this just dropped me out of the summa cum laude range which i rightfully earned and worked really hard for. 

im so stressed and frustrated about this. im leaving for a 2 week trip tmrw and might not have internet access if they try to ask me for proof or some kind of paperwork. is there anything else i can do right now?",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/13tf9q2/my_professor_made_a_mistake_in_my_final_grade_and/

1m59i3o,Applying for PhD right after undergrad,"I have been interested in doing a PhD in biology (U.S.) right after undergrad for a while now, but I am still a bit hesitant about doing it.  

My reasoning for wanting to do a PhD is mostly because of my curiosity and fear of being bored/ hating a job doing the same things every day, etc. I would like a position as a project leader in industry, another interesting route I was introduced to by my cousins girlfriend is scientific consulting, so she reads papers and basically tells her company where to invest for certain therapeutics or technologies. 

Currently, I work in a lab that focuses on RNA at a molecular interaction level, codon usage bias, translational mechanisms as it relates to aging and cancer/ other diseases and also have been doing a lot of bioinformatics which I have realized I enjoy so I would like to continue this. 

Anybody who has followed a similar route: what were your qualifications when applying, was entering a PhD right after BS a culture shock (imposter syndrome, any big realizations, tips you would give someone if they were to do the same), what job do you have currently? 

If anyone is a project leader in a lab: how is your work/life balance? what are the pros and cons of your career? ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1m59i3o/applying_for_phd_right_after_undergrad/
1k0h70v,Left academia with an unfinished paper and guilt‚Äîwhat would you do in my place?,"Hi everyone,

Last month, I left academia after finishing my PhD and working as a postdoc for a year. Since then, I‚Äôve been focusing on developing a business idea‚Äîsomething I‚Äôm genuinely motivated about‚Äîwhile receiving unemployment benefits. It feels exciting to start something new.

During my PhD, I struggled heavily with depression and burnout. I somehow managed to complete it and continued working, but the symptoms persisted. As I quite my research institute, one thing has been weighing heavily on me: I never finished a paper I began writing last year.

I had promised to submit the paper by March, but I kept missing the deadline. Even just before leaving the institute, I told myself‚Äîand others‚Äîthat I‚Äôd finish it soon. I would say that 70% of the work has been done. Several colleagues contributed to this paper, some investing significant time. One in particular, who brought me into the project, knew I was struggling mentally and supported me with incredible patience and kindness. I never wanted to take advantage of that kindness, but now it feels like I have.

I‚Äôve tried to return to the paper recently, but every attempt leaves me feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. Just opening my laptop to work on it triggers a strong urge to walk away. I‚Äôm no longer being paid for the project‚Äîso it‚Äôs not about money. It‚Äôs the guilt. I feel ashamed for not keeping my promise to myself, and I feel awful for disappointing my co-authors.

And yet, I do have some little energy to work on my business idea. That gives me some hope, even if I‚Äôm still navigating my mental health challenges. Finishing the paper doesn‚Äôt matter for my career anymore‚ÄîI‚Äôm done with academia‚Äîbut I still want to complete it out of respect for the people who supported me, especially my former colleague.

So, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:**If you were in my position, what would you do? Would you take a longer break (a few months?) and see if you could return to it with more clarity and energy? Or would you let it go entirely? Or‚Ä¶?**

Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot.

Thank you for reading and for any guidance you might share.

ud9gsr,Switching majors as a junior in college,"Spent two years taking mostly breadths and some bio and chem classes. I originally came into college wanting to double major in bio and stats but dropped stats because I wanted to focus entirely on getting a good gpa for med school. About to end my sophomore year realizing my broke ass can't afford med school and another ~8 years of schooling. I've lost the passion and drive for it because of this. I still like but it's not realistic for me.

So... that's like two years down the hole except for the breadth classes and math prerequisites I've taken so far. I need to take 15 more courses to finish a stats degree and I have 4 semesters left, but 5 including summer classes next year. I'm not the best at math, but I enjoy stats. I took AP stats and fell in love with it. I took a stats course last semester and enjoyed it. I think stats is cool and definitely a more lucrative degree than biology.

Should I go for it? It might be a time crunch and a lot of work but I feel like it'll be much more worth it. I'm beginning to resent biology at this point and I'll feel miserable if I continue it.

15snzta,Afraid to pursue a PhD,"I have finished my master's degree in CS and I want to do a PhD. I have thought really hard about it, and I really like doing research. I have consulted many people in academia, and have been told I have the right mindset and am very prepared (maybe too much). However, I have to admit I am very, very, scared.

To not indulge too much, I have autism, which for me sometimes means sensory issues, anxiety, and OCD. Light can be too bright and sounds too loud if I am overstimulated. I got diagnosed in my early 20s as I had symptoms of an autistic burnout, and it affected my studies. I got more tired more easily, and I didn't understand why. I felt sick very often. It also didn't help that I was hard-set on studying all the time, sacrificing sleep and not doing anything fun.

I have learned the importance of work-life balance, and made changes to my lifestyle. I prioritize sleep, exercise regularly and eat properly. Likewise, I tend to say 'yes' more to doing fun stuff with friends and family, and I feel happier overall. I wish to keep it this way.

Now I look forward, and I want to do a PhD. It is something I do not take lightly, I know how much work it is. I want to pursue it, but I feel scared about what is to come. Will I not be able to handle it? Will I not be able to upkeep a balanced lifestyle? What if I get sick again? That feeling gives me dread and anxiety.

1jjdlao,Family wants me to build their app idea that will totally blow up,"So this whole situation makes me a bit queasy for a reason I can't put my finger on. Looking for advice

Basically the gist is that I'm a cs major, and my mom has been running a failing small business for a long time now, making probably around minimum wage and living off welfare. The small business is failing because the market is terrible for what she's providing and it's not scalable. She's often remarked that a waiter would make more than her.

She's been looking for a big break for a while now. She took a scammy online course that teaches you to make online courses and apparently people all over the world will just buy and it'll be passive income and she will finally be rich. My mom latched onto this idea. Since then for years she's wanted to make it into reality--however, she has no idea about ""all that tech stuff"". So she wants me to build her platform, a website and an app, use ""AI or something"" to edit her videos, and then use ""SEO or something"" to advertise on ""the facebooks"", and then she will be rich. She has promised me handsome compensation of somewhere south of minimum wage if she can get an ""investment"" from a rich relative. Says the experience will be worth it alone for young people like me but the money is just an extra bonus.

Needless to say idk about this idea man...I think even if every other step succeeds, the course itself will not sell. My mom has 0 experience filming or selling courses. But also the relative I don't think will want to invest and she might burn the relationship which she really values. And she has also done no work on her side, she doesn't even have recorded videos because she's waiting for an investment from the relative as an ""angel investor"" so she can pause her business and take a few months off to just record videos. Which I think will be the final straw for her actual business. 

On my part, I think I'd also rather work at starbucks...I think I'd make more working for starbucks for less hours. But more than that I don't want to be there running her whole business only for it to flop. I am stressed just thinking about it.

But needless to say this is an extremely sensitive subject. All her hopes and dreams. She doesn't gamble but this is her lottery ticket. She thinks it's something so important to her, of course her ""tech kid"" should help no questions asked, and if I ask for more compensation she would be outraged because I'm taking advantage of her (I'd be asking for more money than she makes). So far she's brought it up over a dozen times but if I show even a little disinterest she gets sad and offended.

1hvy5rq,Students Impacted by the Pandemic (Class of 2020),"Hi everyone,

I graduated from high school in 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic turned our lives upside down. I enrolled in college in Fall 2020 and was fortunate to receive substantial TOPS funding due to my 3.9 GPA and a composite ACT score of 28. Along with Pell Grants and other scholarships, my financial aid covered tuition at a local university and even provided me with refunds.

However, by December 2021, I made the difficult decision to withdraw from my program. The lack of in-person classes was one of the main reasons. Remote learning just wasn‚Äôt effective for me, and it completely drained the academic morale I had built up through years of preparation for college. I‚Äôve always struggled with online learning, and it didn‚Äôt align with the college experience I had envisioned.

Now, three years later, I‚Äôm ready to return to school and pursue my degree. But this time, I‚Äôve discovered that my financial aid options are far more limited. The bulk of my previous funding came from Louisiana‚Äôs TOPS program, which I believe I‚Äôm no longer eligible for.

I‚Äôm reaching out to see if there are any scholarships, grants, or other financial aid programs available for students like me‚Äîthose who enrolled in college for the first time during the pandemic and were negatively affected by the resulting shutdowns and remote learning.

1ghud6j,Never Give Up Yall,"Hey everyone, 

Up until yesterday I've been struggling to get a job I would be satisfied with.

This all started back in Fall of 2022 where I got a final round interview with SIG. I was so escatic and studied my ass off for the technical interview. I ended up solving everything but was shocked to see I ended up not getting the offer. I was really sad because I was so hyped for the position. That year- I ended up going to work for Target as a SWE Intern.

The work at Target was great, but the pay and location was below industry average. I ended up declining my return offer and delaying my graduation date to lock tf in for another round of internship applications. During Fall of 2023, I got 0 interviews. I thought my resume was cooked or something, but after 15 Perfect OAs and 300+ job apps, I was left with nothing. Come Spring 2024, I finally heard back for the first time in a long time. Meta! They reached out to me for an OA for their Summer 2024 Internship. I was jumping up and down and was super motivated to do well on the OA.

Unfortunately, I ended up getting rejected after the OA part as I wasn't able to solve every question. I honestly got really sad since I really liked the company. Then, a few months before summer, Coinbase reached out to me with their OA. I did it, got to the final round for their frontend swe internship, and fumbled the bag so hard. I'm really good with React and somehow I cooked myself on some basic logic that I should have been able to solve. That spring/summer, I ended up going back to my old small company that kept me employed during that time. I am very grateful for them.

Come Fall 2024, I heard back from Capital One. This one... this one was cursed. The morning of my interviews, the power went out because some eagle fell from the sky and sniped my transformer. In response, I ended up yoloing my entire net worth on 0dte spy puts. (Don't ask me why - I had some problems ok). I ended up losing a decent chunk of it (12k) and had to somehow figure out how to do my interviews without power. So, my friend drove me to my gf's college and I did my interviews there with 2 minutes to spare. I aced my powerday and felt good that i was able to overcome such a crazy situation. I ended up somehow getting rejected anyways for God knows what reason. This one still baffles me to this day.

Around 2 hours after I got rejected by C1 I heard back from Figma for their internship. For context, I got into my masters program so i was applying to both internships and new grad jobs. I honestly thought Figma was super cool as I love their product so I locked in for their OA, got the final round, thought I did well but ended up getting rejected anyways. At this point, I thought I was cursed and was gonna never get a dream job.

Then, like a WWE wrestler coming back from Season 2, Meta responded to my new grad application. This time, I was ready for their OA. I spent every second of my days preparing myself. After passing the OA and getting the final round, I locked in harder than I ever did in my life. For 3 weeks, I woke up, leetcoded, ate, and went to bed. I got to the point where if you gave me any LC problem, there'd be a 90% chance I'll be able to solve it in under 20 minutes. After the final round, I felt exhausted. I did nothing for the next week besides rummaging through my Meta's portal, anxiously looking for GrapgQL insights. 

Yesterday, I heard back that I got an offer from Meta for their Software Engineer (University Grad) role. After all the shit I've been through, it's incredibly satisfying to accomplish something I thought I'd never get. I was able to turn down my AI masters program from GT and am happy that I no longer have to spend 40k self funding my post graduate education.

If there's anything to take away from the shit I've been through these past few years, it's to never give up on your dreams. I fought til the very end to get this offer, and I hope to whoever read this long ass post, it gives you the motivation to never stop trying.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ghud6j/never_give_up_yall/

That‚Äôs where I met my PI‚Äîwe‚Äôll call her Dr. A. Dr. A is a highly intelligent woman, but she‚Äôs socially awkward and, at times, extremely ignorant and borderline racist. She‚Äôs a Gen Xer who believes in running yourself into the ground for your job (even if you're an unpaid undergraduate volunteer). For example, she once shared that she gave birth during her postdoc and returned to the lab the same day to run gels.


While I can admire her dedication and mindset, she completely fails when it comes to recognizing the efforts of others. During undergrad, the lab included multiple PhDs, a couple of master‚Äôs-level lab techs, and both medical and undergraduate students. We all got along well, and the environment overall had great energy. The PhDs, in particular, were supportive‚Äîthey genuinely wanted to help us learn, grow, gain experience, and even earn publications. To some extent, Dr. A supported that too.

That said, there was clear favoritism among the students. Out of eight students, two of us consistently spent 20‚Äì30 hours per week in the lab doing unpaid grunt work, receiving no acknowledgment whatsoever from Dr. A. Meanwhile, her favored students only showed up for weekly lab meetings and occasionally helped with large group experiments‚Äîyet they received all the praise. I didn‚Äôt care about the praise itself, but I did care about the disparity in recognition and credit. These favored students were listed on significantly more publications‚Äîat least six each‚Äîdespite putting in a fraction of the effort. I was lucky to be included on a couple, including one I wrote myself.


Despite all this, I genuinely enjoyed my time in the lab. The people I worked with made the experience worthwhile, and it sparked my interest in neuroscience and potentially neurosurgery.

Fast forward a few years: I‚Äôm now a medical student, and I‚Äôve returned to the same lab. Dr. A is now a department chair at the medical school and plays a major role in residency selection. Nearly everyone from the original lab is gone, replaced by new faces. The environment has become deeply toxic.


The lab is now essentially run by the lab manager and a PhD researcher, neither of whom show any interest in conducting experiments or producing research. They spend their days in a shared office gossiping about others. Meanwhile, PhD students are treated like free labor, working 40+ hours a week while being regularly berated. Other PhD researchers work remotely, so we rarely interact with them. There are also a few med students, two undergrads, and two lab techs. None of us enjoy being there‚Äîthe atmosphere is suffocating. Every time we enter the lab, it feels like a gloomy fog over us. We‚Äôre all treated poorly. 

For the past year, I‚Äôve spent most of my free time‚Äîoutside of school and studying‚Äîworking in the lab, unpaid, trying to contribute and earn publications. Despite this, neither I nor the PhD students have received a single publication credit. In contrast, the lab heads are constantly praising two undergrads who come in less than 10 hours a week, mostly sit around chatting, and do minimal work. Yet they‚Äôre being listed on multiple publications this year, including one in a high-impact journal. The lab techs are also being credited on everything, due to Dr. A‚Äôs policy that ‚Äústudents have to work harder to get on pubs.‚Äù Essentially, the students who need publications the most‚ÄîPhDs and med students‚Äîare being excluded, despite doing the majority of the work.


Dr. A has been largely absent throughout this time. As a chair, she spends most of her time in meetings, and when we do see her, she vents about her responsibilities and complains about our performance. She‚Äôs become extremely irritable, frequently snapping at us during meetings and publicly berating students. She particularly dislikes me‚Äîlikely because I asked her for a letter of recommendation (which she made me write) and because I chose to take a few gap years after undergrad to work and travel rather than do unpaid research in her lab.

Recently, we collaborated with another lab on an experiment, but the samples we used had not been properly stored, resulting in poor staining and unusable data. I was responsible for the staining, and in a meeting with the other lab‚Äôs PI (Dr. F), Dr. A spent 30 minutes trying to get him to blame me. To his credit, he defended me the entire time, eventually conceding that while some errors might have occurred, nothing could be confirmed. That was enough for Dr. A to berate me in our next lab meeting, publicly questioning my competence, my future in medicine, and my potential to pursue neurosurgery.

As bad as that was, other students have had it worse‚Äîboth publicly and privately. She once called a student on leave after a death in the family to criticize them for not being ‚Äúcommitted enough.‚Äù She also frequently makes racially insensitive comments about Asian and Indian people. While they often come across as ignorant, the frequency makes me question whether there‚Äôs a deeper bias behind them.


All of this said, I desperately want to leave the lab. I‚Äôm exhausted from being yelled at, used, and unrecognized. But I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt switch labs within the department because Dr. A is the department chair and would block the move. I also can‚Äôt do research elsewhere without taking a year off, which isn‚Äôt feasible given my schedule. Burning this bridge would be satisfying, but Dr. A sits on the residency selection board, and she has significant influence. This is my home program, and realistically, it‚Äôs my best shot at matching into neurosurgery.


I have no idea how to move forward. I'm open to any advice. Sorry for the long read.

TLDR: Me and other students being treated like shit by potentially racist, abusive PI. Not getting any pubs. Potentially can't leave because she has pull with the residency board for the home program I want to attend.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1kqj4mm/i_hate_my_research_pi_but_she_could_very_easily/

1k4uhx3,Didn't network throughout my PhD at all and am paying the price. What can I do now?,"I'm (31M) a 5th year PhD student defending their dissertation this Friday. I've had a tumultuous PhD, as indicated in the list below. Skip the list if you saw the comment with the details:

1.) First PhD advisor dropped me due to a dispute over how I managed the lab. She advised me from 2020 (my first year)-2022.

2.) Program chair thankfully takes me as an advisee. At this point though, my autistic burnout and PTSD (yes, it's clinically diagnosed) were so bad that I could only focus on doing one research project at a time (my first PhD advisor made me only work on one project at a time) and still am only working on only my dissertation. I put in 10-20 hours per week's worth of work this academic year.

3.) My stipend got cut in half my 3rd year due to university budget issues. Same tuition waiver was intact thankfully, so I got the rest of my program paid off at that point.

4.) I got a visiting instructor gig at a nearby SLAC my 4th year and bombed it horribly (this is not hyperbole either, I got 1-2s out of 5 across the board on all categories). Thankfully, it fulfilled service credit for me to keep some fellowship money.

Notably, I never collaborated throughout my PhD and was basically isolated from every other department and professor in my case. Fast forward to now and I have no connections really other than my old internship boss from last summer who occasionally sends out messages to the ""2024 cohort"" of interns. My job applications are all as cold as cold can get. What can I do now to try and salvage myself?

1huww43,"I'm almost there, yet I feel helpless √ß_√ß","Hi everyone! I think the title says it all.

I'm in the writing process of my PhD thesis (humanities). Theoretically, I should live in a state of perpetual adrenaline release, and my stamina should be at its highest.

Yet I feel quite the opposite. I think that paradoxically enough I'm experiencing a burnout, as a result of a very difficult PhD experience.

1. My main supervisor has not been helpful through my PhD. Rarely answering emails, I had often to call him and one time I had even to wait for him outside the classroom where he was giving lecture, in order to talk about some urgent matter with him.

While he \*once\* wrote for me a presentation letter that let me win a very   important fellowship, he was never there to write further presentation letters that I needed (once because of his own negligence, other times he was so difficult to contact that I couldn't even talk about what I needed).

2. My project proved to be utterly difficult, and it took a toll on my mental and physical health. It needed extensive archival research to be done through Europe (I'm Italian), often within private archives not easy to access. Imagine spending three years travelling from one city to another one, with almost non-existent financial support by my home university. Not to mention the continuous negotiating with professionals who spoke a language different from mine (this has been very helpful from one side tho).

While I had partly anticipated this, I didn't imagine that my own supervisor and other professors wouldn't have cared for my efforts nor wouldn't make me feel validated. I didn't start for sure this PhD fantasizing about becoming everyone's puppy, but didn't even expect senior scholars to be so apathetic.

Basically I'm in a phase where I feel conflicted about what I've achieved (which is a lot) vs this veil of pessimism above me. I don't feel motivated, I feel like these three years have been useless and I see even more uncertainity for the years to come. I want to try to concentrate now as I have to finish this damn thesis at all costs.

End of rant.

Did you ever felt like me? What helped you to finish your work?

1hofq1o,Academic hazing?,"I've been at my professorship at a large university for almost a year now, and am still overwhelmed and anxious at what's expected.  I came from a largely industry-creative background (was never a TA or adjunct) and had naively expected there would be a training/on-boarding period where I'd be instructed on how to develop a syllabus/course plan, observe how teaching is carried out over term, and know best practices in terms of grading, addressing attendance, and some of the more philosophical tenets of higher education.  NOPE.  The on-boarding was brief, largely inconsequential, and at best let me know where to park and who our football team was playing that weekend.  I was turned loose on the students, neither of us really sure where things were going.  

I've addressed my feelings of being overwhelmed and anxious with a few colleagues in and out of the university system, and it sounds like this is pretty much standard modern-day academia: build up a massive CV, go through an intensive day of presentations and interviews during the screening process, then suck it up and just teach yourself day-to-day with lots of crash and burn (in front of a live studio audience) until you ""get it.""  Someone said this is typical for 1-2 years, which wasn't really motivational for me to hear.

That all said, I don't feel like I'm being treated any less or differently than others who've been hired from similar backgrounds, it just floors me that in any other job I've held, training and skill-building was done ahead of the expected duties.  I've lost sleep, had panic attacks right before and right after class, and am often feeling rudderless as I try to navigate my next course.

Thanks for listening to my rant.  I'm not sure what I'm really looking for.

y6u9oh,Would you change your major if your family is rich?,"As title says. Are most people majoring in CS just for the higher than average pay and would rather do something different?

I'm overwhelmed sometimes by the pressure of being a CS major and especially right now as I'm a senior student trying to find a job during a recession. I did 350 LC problems in a month, mostly medium and hard starting from 0 (That's like easily over 10 hours of programming per day). I go to a top 15 University with decent GPA and applied to around 100 companies only to receive less than 10 OA's. Thanks to the practice I had on LC I Aced all of the OA's but only 2 of them moved on to an interview. I don't know how much my international status as a Canadian or my identity as an Asian male factors into this.

I'm just kind of sad at this point. I know I wouldn't be broke even if I don't find a job as my family is fairly rich, making a couple of millions per year. At the same time I feel like my life that culminated to this point is pointless. This include doing well in school from primary school to get into a good secondary school, then to a good University, and lastly potentially landing a high paying job. Don't get me wrong: I like Computer Science, but I certainly don't like the above average pressure and work load that's associated with it. I guess this is only exacerbated by the fact that my parents have high expectations for me as I'm always that ""good kid"" growing up.

1ee3faq,"Called out my supervisor on his BS, On a scale of 1 to 10, how f*cked am I?","So my PI has this annoying habit of unnecessarily creating interpersonal conflicts in the lab. After one month of back-breaking troubleshooting, I got my system working and finished my analysis yesterday. Now, when I had to give away the charge of the system to the next person who wanted to use it, he started doing this 'you know she doesn't want anyone else to use this machine' business. I found out about everything because, unbeknownst to him, labmates are pretty close and transparent. I was furious because that was not at all the case, but I kept my calm. Then he brought one more person into the problem and then, in a parallel, isolated conversation, started bad-mouthing that person to me and even asked me to call that person and put the call on loudspeaker. I mean, jesus fucking christ!, what is this? a reality TV show?

And, then, I lost it.

Gave him a nice earful and let him know that I was aware of his what he was up to. I was not rude, but it was pretty obvious that I was angry. The conversation ended in a diplomatic way (he even got that person into room  which did not work in his favour); he was a little snubbed because he got called out and proceeded to make a few saving-grace jokes about how it was his intention to facilitate communication rather than brew conflicts.

Now, how much fucked am I after this? Honestly, if there was no power play involved since he is my supervisor, I wouldn't be worried because I feel I did the right thing. I absolutely abhor bitching and gossiping. All in all, he is a pretty harmless person (more like a pathological gossiper), but still, should I extend an olive branch to him? Or should I pretend that it never happened and move on?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, y'all!

After reflecting on this thing and giving myself some space, let me explain things a little better...The thing is that at my heart, I believe that he is actually a good person. It is just that he has this gossiping habit. But he is a profound scientist and cares for his students (he just likes inducing mild drama into the lab), and I cannot help but respect him a lot for his scientific merit, which is why I actually feel guilty about going a little extreme by confronting him. These things have happened before ( he gossips about all labmates equally), but I was always able to keep a level head through all of them. But yesterday, I was so exhausted, had not slept properly in a month, had not showered in the last three days  (I was wearing the same underwear for the last two days because I did not get time to do laundry) and had a fever, too, that I just exploded. It's like you are used to working with some people because you admire the good qualities they have and also because you learn to ignore their bad ones. And yesterday, I could not ignore the bad one, which left me awkward and a little paranoid after the confrontation. I just think that on a better day, I could have minded my own way through this thing. In essence, I could have handled it in a better way: simply ignore and focus on the work. But I am more disappointed in myself rather than him. He behaved in the way he always has; it was my tolerance level that dropped. If this was one of my experiments, I would conclude my response as the dependent variable, my tolerance level/ state of mind as the actual independent variable and his gossip as the control variable only.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ee3faq/called_out_my_supervisor_on_his_bs_on_a_scale_of/

1lgp44d,Done with my defense - tips that helped me!,"I successfully defended my PhD (Health Sciences) last week and wanted to hop on here to say thank you! I was panicking the days leading to my defense, and all the posts here really made me feel like I was not alone. :)

Sharing some things I did that helped me significantly leading to the big day:

**Read my thesis.**

I did not read my thesis after submission (highly recommend), so reading it again after around 2 months gave me a fresh perspective. It kind of felt like I was reviewing a different person's work, and I was able to ask myself questions that I never thought of before. In hindsight, I am so grateful to my supervisor for giving me this tip because my examiners ended up asking a lot of questions about the methodology - mostly about why I chose to do this and that. Reading the whole thesis a few days before the defense really helped me understand my own work significantly better and helped me explain/justify all the decisions I made for my research.

**Trusted my supervisor.**

I have bad imposter syndrome, and I tend to shrug off compliments given to me by anyone, including my supervisor. I would usually have a small negative voice inside my head saying, ""Oh, he's only saying that because he doesn't know the whole story"". I am fortunate enough to have a supervisor who rooted for me and I *consciously* chose to believe him when he said that I was ready and that I will do well during our last meeting.

**Breathed.**

I was extremely nervous the day of the defense, and I woke up with a queasy stomach. A podcast I was listening to mentioned that breathing was a remote control of the nervous system, and I can now confirm that this is true. I took **slow** and controlled breaths (5 secs in, 5 secs out) whenever I would feel myself tensing up and it made a whole lot of difference.

**Acknowledged my limitations.**

I was thrown a few questions and suggestions that I *knew* were limitations of my research, and I just humbled myself and thanked the examiners for pointing those out. I made sure to acknowledge what they said, explain (not in a defensive way) why I chose to do this/that, and discuss how I would improve in future research. After the defense, two of my examiners pointed out that they appreciated that I knew the limitations of my own study and that I was open to feedback. It was actually very freeing to know that my research was not perfect (no research IS perfect) and very empowering to hear myself talk about how I would be able to improve it next time.

A lot of people told me to relax because ""I was the expert in the room"" and that everything would go well, but honestly, it was sooo hard to believe those words then. I can now confirm that it *is* true - if you wrote that thesis and did those experiments, then you *are* the most knowledgable person in the room about your own work. I hope this helps our future doctors in this sub! All the best and good luck. :)",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1lgp44d/done_with_my_defense_tips_that_helped_me/
1f8t3hp,"Possibly the worst outcome of a PhD defense‚Äîand no, it's not about failing","I've been a long-time lurker here and have always come across ""delightful defense"" stories. For quite a long time, I  wanted to post mine as I neared my defense examination. It happened yesterday, and it was indeed everything I wished for. The examiner was rigorous yet seemed impressed with the dissertation.  The audience appreciated the presentation, and both my supervisors were equally happy (context later).

...and just like that, it was time for celebrations. Never had I ever received these many congratulations within such a short span of time. It was a dream, and I was living it. I woke up today with the sole aim of getting all the required paperwork done and getting the official degree before I leave for home to spend time with my family.

While I was breezing through my paperwork like a pro, clocking in 12k step-count within a couple of hours and risking the pathetic weather multiple times, shit was just about to get real.

I received a call from my co-supervisor, and my instinctive gut feeling always gets things right. They were probably going to shit on me (we have a history, and getting calls like that implies a difficult conversation)..and boy, did my gut get me this time.

My primary supervisor had forwarded them the final defense passing documents for signatures, knowing that I had finished most formalities from my end within a day. They happened to have a ""conversation,"" after which the aforementioned call was made.

My throat hurts with the lump still. Long story short, ""they"" supposedly (within a span of few hours) decided that I should instead publish the remaining chapters before they could sign off the final recommendation to the Dean.

Verbatim:  ""You have tried to game us by partially writing thesis chapters for the sole aim of finishing the degree on time. You should have instead parallelly written the papers, and allowing your defense was a mistake. So, now, 'we' decide that unless you submit the remaining couple of papers, 'we' won't approve your degree. You can't be allowed to escape away, and don't think of it as exploitation since you're the one who will benefit from this. You don't have sufficient papers which you deserve, and that's really bad.""

It's my work, I understand. No one in the world wants to get it published and recognized more than me, but they don't happen to get that I am dealing with a lot of priorities at the moment, including mental and physical issues, most of which they know but I am sure don't care to remember. I did promise them to finish them up once I get back home since I have exhausted my fellowship tenure and can't afford to stay in the campus residence. Also, I did have an easy gap of months before I went for my postdoc.

I'm not angry. It's just sad that all these years of working together had to culminate at this level of distrust. Frankly, it hurts, to work really hard with all my might to see this day.

All my plans of partying and treating my labmates now stay indefinitely canceled. I don't know if I'm in a good mental state right now and might do something really stupid. Supervisors have a lot of power to influence my job recommendations; I don't want to mess up my career.

To anyone reading this far, thanks.

If I were to encounter someone recruiting again, how would I go about politely refusing them without being rude about it? I know what it‚Äôs like having gone through that, I don‚Äôt want to have them feel horrible but I don‚Äôt want that again. This is my one chance to get my life back together.

1bqdwvd,Sophomore CS major with a 2.07 gpa. Is it over for me? ,"It‚Äôs just what the title says. I was never a coding kid but was interested in learning computer science. While applying to colleges I couldn‚Äôt see myself in any other major so computer science felt like the perfect choice but the moment I became a freshman, the imposter syndrome hit hard. I never coded before while half my peers already had their own websites they coded from scratch and literally did coding as a hobby. To have a community, I made friends with other cs majors who were total beginners and somehow got through freshman year with the help of friends and chatgpt. I was barely surviving (Bs and Cs) and lost a few friends in cs bc they changed majors after second semester‚Äôs OOP course

Then in the first semester of sophomore year, we had DSA and it was dubbed the actual weed out course of our major. It was and it did. I failed that course and my grades in other courses drastically dropped too. Most of my friends switched majors again, i literally don‚Äôt have that community anymore. 

While I was trying to survive in this major, go to clubs, network, find internships, hangout with friends and have everything together, two years almost passed. I‚Äôve failed until now and am left with no experience, no good projects and a painful gpa of 2.07. 

I can‚Äôt seem to find any internship or research over the summer bc of my gpa. I want to be in computer science and go to grad school but I‚Äôm so lost. My transcripts are so bad that I don‚Äôt even want my advisor to look at it. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôve already ruined my chances to bag a good internship, do research or go to a top post grad program. My professors will only consider a student for research if they have a gpa of 3.5 and above. Even if I get a 4.0 in every semester from now, I might not hit that mark.

1mqa3rw,Current MS2 that is dying to drop out. Are other options feasible at this point?,"There isn‚Äôt a day that goes by where I don‚Äôt spend all my free time thinking about dropping out of medical school.

My passion for helping individuals with brain injuries started after I experienced multiple concussions in high school, but I‚Äôve been open to different ways of achieving that goal. Becoming a doctor always just seemed like the most sensible route because of the high pay, flexibility to pursue almost anything, and authority that comes with the title. However, I knew what becoming a doctor involves, so before starting med school, I told myself I‚Äôd quit after the first year if I was miserable. Now, in my second year, I am indeed still miserable, but I still have no solid backup plan. I hate the stress, time commitment, and pressure of medicine, and I already have little interest in being a practicing physician. I‚Äôm not suicidal, but I‚Äôm deeply unhappy with my location, my lifestyle, and the lack of balance. The only joy I get in life is from weekend trips every few months (funded with loan money), but that's nowhere near enough to offset my day-to-day misery.

I still want a job that is intellectually engaging, allows me to make a positive impact, involves talking to people and moving around, and leaves me feeling proud about my profession. A PhD at this point sounds interesting but doesn't seem to make sense because it seems like the same level of commitment with a third of the pay. My ideal role would be leading projects to develop new brain injury therapeutics‚Äînot doing the bench work, but overseeing teams, managing progress, ensuring quality, and perhaps handling some sales. At the end of the day, I want a happy life where I can make a positive impact on people at work while having time to do what I love, without the stress of feeling like I‚Äôm shortchanging patients.

A big part of my struggle is location. I moved from my dream location‚Äîwhere I worked 9‚Äì5, lived near the beach, played volleyball, surfed often, and spent time with friends‚Äîto the worst place I‚Äôve ever lived. My top five hobbies don‚Äôt exist here, the culture doesn‚Äôt fit me, and the social scene is basically nonexistent. My only friends here are classmates, but everyone is so busy studying that we rarely do anything, and there‚Äôs little to do anyway. I was supposed to spend the summer deciding whether to return, but instead I went back to my happy place to be with friends during my only time off.

My closest friends still live there, working under 40 hours a week and making $150‚Äì400k in software engineering or project management. Meanwhile, medical school demands so much that I haven‚Äôt even had time to find a therapist, though I think therapy could help me gain perspective.

**My dilemma:**

* **Stay**¬†in med school for three more years in a place where I am absolutely miserable, hoping it leads directly to a well-paying, fulfilling role in my dream location‚Äîbut risk wasting prime years 26-30 for a job I might not even want.
* **Leave**¬†now, move back to the place and people I love, and work my way up over 5‚Äì10 years toward a leadership role‚Äîwhile accepting that I might never make enough to afford a home there. I also already have approximately $120,000 of loans.

I know leaving med school with just a BS won‚Äôt give me a cushy, high-paying job immediately. But staying feels like giving up years of my life for the sake of a path that no longer excites me.

1mk57xa,My partner doesn't respect academia,"I've struggled with some things that my partner has been saying since starting my PhD. 

It doesn't really matter what it is, but when I talk about academia or colleagues, he doesn't seem to have much respect for it as someone who grew up working class.

Just as an example, I was having a little rant today about how academia doesn't always suit people wanting a family, setting up a home, or generally needing some stability due to the nature of someone needing to commit to finding competitive, temporary, fixed-term positions for years until they're experienced enough for a professorship, and he goes ""Well that's what plumbers and carpenters do all the time, you academics just think a lot of yourself"". The same happens when I say I'm stressed, or working a lot, it'll be a comment (albeit, meant to be a jokey one) about how I 'don't have a real job' and the conversation is shut down. 

I know academia works for privileged people, I know I'm privileged to be funded to do my research, and I know a lot of struggles aren't unique to academia, but sometimes I just want him to be proud of me and respect what I do - and come on, I just want to be able to vent about something! 

Just to add: I am not from a well-off family and have no financial support outside of my funding and part-time work, so it's not a jab at me, although it often feels like it. I also go to a very well-off, fancy university, so that doesn't help. 

Does anyone have any experience with this attitude to academia, either from family, friends or partners? I don't really know how to navigate it; it upsets me, but I also do understand why he struggles with the class differences.

1fzxpgb,Out of the woodwork ,"Someone please tell me what planet is in retrograde or astrological whatever is whatevering this week because I am about to move off grid and live in a yurt. 

In the past week alone I've had a student in my online class use the Discussion forum to insult other students and when I posted that I would have to change the Discussions so that I have to individually approve posts and offer an apology to the students he offended, he starts posting spam stuff including links i am sure are NSFW.

Another student blew the deadline to hand in an assignment and missed the built in extension period and only after getting the email about how he can no longer pass the class, he decides to act.  He's spent more energy in the last three days on fighting my policy than he has done the rest of the semester.  In my mandatory meeting with him and the chair he says he didn't hand in the paper because he was busy with his other classes and ""work and stuff"".  He made a scene at the end of class trying to get the other students mutiny or something. Which only made him more upset when no one joined him. 

Another student who has STILL not bought the textbook and also failed for not handing in a major project shows up today. I politely ask if he's checked his email (where I have explained the policy).  He says yes ""and I'll get that project to you soon.""  Um no. Clearly this is how he has worked his education thus far and apparently I'm a bad person for not letting him do this. 

Then at the end of my last class I had a student bright red and shaking in tears because he got....a C+.  He didn't include a major component of the assignment. He wants to grieve the grade. He told me he got a 92 on his math test and had a panic attack so bad that he had to call 911.  He suggested it would not be nice of me to make him call 911 again. 

I'm done yall. I'm so exhausted. I know most of these are generally nice kids who have just never been taught things like accountability or conflict resolution but this is an all new level of emotional labor on top of teaching and grading.  They are so smart when it comes to ways to manipulate or as we say in the South ""outhouse lawyer"" and if they used half of that energy in the actual work they'd be Rhodes Scholars.

ygafsz,This sub does not represent what it's like to go to grad school,"I know [USER] was joking, but I decided to give some context for prospective grad students about why the sub looks the way it does and what good (if at all) they can expect from grad school. For context, I'm a grad student in the humanities.

**Why is this sub so grim?**

Because well-adjusted grad students probably don't use Reddit.

I'm kidding. Sorta. The thing is that there are people who are good at handling interpersonal issues, who work out and maintain hobbies and relationships outside of grad school who probably don't feel like they have to go to the internet for advice or a safe space to complain. They probably just whine to their spouse or their buddy over a beer after class and go home to throw on Netflix while doing their exercises or something. My *guess* is that a lot of people who come here don't have many friends in grad school and lack a real life community to commiserate with and don't have good coping strategies (me included). If you're coming from a working class background, you have social anxiety, and you're a stressed out first year who hasn't made friends, of *course* you're going to go where you're guaranteed fellowship when you're freaking out or need to vent. Nobody IRL gets it! But the good news, like ""I got published"" or ""I'm making money from a job"" is often easy for your loved ones to understand. No need to post here, then, because you say it to the people in your life and it's off the brain.

My other guess is the situation globally is not good. More people are going for higher education with more and more pressures to succeed while hearing, constantly, that the world is fucking ending. I think there are people going to grad school who aren't passionate about the subject and are hoping another degree will guarantee them comfort even as society crumbles. These people are realizing it might not be worth the effort, since you're basically treated like a glorified intern with a shrinking job pool and, if you're in arts, no private sector to fall back on. The truth is the economy fucking sucks and that's going to impact how people experience grad school when grad school is treated like a key to economic mobility.

Most importantly (as a non-American) this sub has a bias to the US and STEM. Most grad students in most universities are STEM, even if STEM is only half the faculty. I think many STEM students work on their PI's passions before they ever get to work on their own, and they're stuck in the lab all day away from their families. It sounds lonely! Sorry if I'm wrong about that, lab-dwellers, it's just what some of you tell me. I don't speak from experience on this. I think, if you're not doing research in a lab or overseas like an ethnographer, you have a bit more flexibility and you get to study what you like. I did most of my MA thesis from the comfort of my apartment, and also I have healthcare.

**What you can expect from grad school if you go in aiming to get the most from it**

Grad school, for me, has been a vital and transformative time in my life. I've beaten my social anxiety and I've gained so much confidence in my self. I believe I have worth and value! I don't think my time should be wasted. Like I got hired for multiple research project by some of the profs in my department that not only make my CV look killer, they trained me to talk to strangers and make good conversation. I have skills as an interviewer now! I've also learned how to write faster, to research more efficiently, and to write with different styles. Grant writing wasn't something I knew how to do prior to, but now I can add that to my resume if I want to work for a non-profit or something.

I've made friendships with some people that I think will last a life time. My cohort are the only people who really understand what I've experienced. They're amazing people, we have similar values and goals, and we get along well. The tough shit is tough, but that means the people you're weathering it with are bonded to you.

Most importantly, though, is I've *learned so much* and I've *grown.* Don't get me wrong, I've had my stress-out days. But the world feels so much more manageable. I feel like I can start to face it and I'm not stressed out if I encounter something I don't know, because I've figured out a lot of difficult things before! A problem is a learning opportunity, not a terrifying threat to my person.

**But like, everyone on here is miserable!**

Listen, the university is *fucked*. Grad students are being exploited in the same way artists who are paid in exposure are being exploited. We're passionate apprentices eager to improve and the system is built to profit off of us like walk-in clients at a conveyor belt nail salon. You need to know how hard it's going to be. No one encouraged me to go to grad school. Like, people congratulated me once I got in and told me they believed in me. But I get why no one pushed me until I had made the decision: most people genuinely think it's unethical to encourage someone to go to grad school without warning them that it's not usually pleasant and the reasons for that are economic. I had a fully funded ride, so I didn't have to work during my courses and my rent didn't eat up my entire stipend. You might not, and you might have undiagnosed mental illness, and you might not connect with anyone in your program, and your advisor might not be so supportive... You're hedging an enormous bet for the love of learning when you apply for grad school.

But if this is something you have to do, you'll go through it and come out stronger and more formidable than you were before.

As for regular users of this sub, I think it's probably important for us to post more positive content from time to time, like our successes or funny stories or neat factoids. We have to remind ourselves why we do this so other prospective students watching us go in looking for that kind of experience while bracing themselves for the impact. We don't want people to go in thinking they're inflicting pain on themselves for no reason.

&#x200B;

Edit: to the people saying I'm not acknowledging that other people's experiences are different, I actually do! Read the third to last paragraph.

As for the people saying I'm not acknowledging the systemic forces that are pushing people to their breaking points, I do touch on it when I say ""the university is fucked"" and ""grad students are being exploited."" I also literally say the reasons for many people's misery are ***economic***. What is the economy?

1ftxzed,How to let an undergrad go?,"So I (now newly 3rd year PhD in USA) interviewed this person (now 4th year UnderGrad, just switched majors to stem/my labs focus right before the interview) last winter and chose her to join out of several applicants despite a slightly lower gpa cus she seemed capable and good to work with.

Through the winter quarter, UG was not very reliable to show up, didn‚Äôt take notes despite me reminding her, and ended up having to take a few week break from the lab at the end   because of burnout, which I totally understand. She said she‚Äôd return for spring, in which I‚Äôd be taking my QE, so my amazing lab mate took her under her wing for me. She continued to not be reliable, barely showed up once a week, still no notes, but at least some practical experience was gained. One time they had an agreed to meet and the UG finally texted my lab mate an hour after they were supposed to meet that she couldn‚Äôt make it. Almost always, these are emergencies or finals. 

Fast forward to this fall quarter. She had an internship over summer in industry where she learned some techniques, notebooks skills, and hopefully time management. Promising to drop her other lab to commit to ours, she still didn‚Äôt show up for our first meeting this week or drop by the lab last week like she said she would.

To be blunt, I‚Äôm exhausted. My advisor requires me to write every detail of his conference presentations ‚Äî slides, scripts, everything ‚Äî and he barely engages until he reviews and nitpicks it a week later. I‚Äôve also been made to fact-check and review drafts of his popular science books, and take calls during evenings and weekends with no boundaries. While I‚Äôve managed to endure this so far, the final straw is this: our lab typically has a publication cycle of 3‚Äì4 years, and although I have a co‚Äìfirst-author paper currently in revision at Nature, he‚Äôs insisting I publish an additional paper before I can graduate. That‚Äôs not realistic for me, and it‚Äôs led me to think seriously about starting over elsewhere once the paper is published.

I'm now considering applying to neuroscience PhD programs in the US or UK. (Most EU programs are not an option since I don‚Äôt have a master‚Äôs degree.)

My main concerns:

My undergraduate GPA is 3.33/4.00 ‚Äî not terrible, but not particularly competitive.

Given my advisor‚Äôs strong opposition to me leaving (he tends to treat students as if he ""owns"" them ‚Äî even trying to control our postdoc destinations, and has frequently threatened to withhold graduation if we don't comply with his demands), I likely won‚Äôt be able to get a letter of recommendation from him or other faculty I‚Äôve worked closely with during my PhD, as he tends to exert pressure on colleagues to prevent them from supporting students who go against his wishes.

I‚Äôm currently considering:

A professor from an undergrad course I took 4 years ago, but i had quite good relationship with him. But I haven't contacted with him since.

A professor I briefly collaborated with on a joint project

Possibly a postdoc who graduated from my current lab



I know LORs carry a lot of weight in applications, and I‚Äôm still struggling to figure out who I can reasonably ask for a letter.

Given this situation, do I have a realistic shot at being admitted to a top-tier PhD program in the US or UK in neuroscience? Any advice would be deeply appreciated ‚Äî especially around how to frame my situation and make the most of what I do have.

1n0bqq0,Tough student behaviors,"Happy first day of classes for those who celebrate!

Kicked off my 9th year of adjuncting today. For the first time I've got a student that is mildly disruptive. I'm planning on double checking if they have any learning accommodations. 

This student basically had a comment/outburst for everything I said, which ate up a lot of class time and I did a mix of ignoring them and continuing to lecture and also engaging with their comments. I could tell some of the students were getting annoyed. 

One of the statements they made had to do with their displeasure about the class time being inconvenient. Then interrupted to ask clarifying questions about the semester while I'm trying to explain my process. On and on with chiming in about YouTube habits and their major and I want to be supportive and helpful but I was mentally exhausted after 75 minutes of this, after teaching earlier.

1fgo4gs,I want to quit,"TLDR; 6 weeks from defense in a miserable PhD in a field I hate, want to quit. Overwhelmed, behind on writing, and worried weak dissertation isn‚Äôt worth the effort of finishing/defending.

I am, allegedly, 6 weeks from my defense. I have been miserable every second of this degree. I wanted to quit very soon after starting but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to. I have felt like a really bad PhD student because I have such a lack of interest in my field in general. I hate it, actually. I convinced myself the money would be worth it in the end because I could land a job outside of my field in tech with the PhD skills like many of my PI‚Äôs past students. The issue is, I feel like I didn‚Äôt learn much because I hated my work so much that I have just avoided it and done the bare minimum. Honestly, I‚Äôve probably been doing less than that given how behind and unprepared I feel this close to my defense. On top of that, the job I have lined up is IN my field, just at the PhD level. So, that‚Äôs not exciting either. 

I don‚Äôt think my PhD is very defendable, honestly. 2 of the chapters are published, which in itself was shocking enough to me. But the rest of it is absolute garbage. ESPECIALLY this last chapter. It‚Äôs poorly designed and poorly executed with not great results. I take blame for part of that, but also my advisor has some too. This last chapter itself could‚Äôve been my entire PhD, but I didn‚Äôt even know what my thesis title was until a little over a year ago, right before my quals. I felt like for my whole PhD I was throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks and then trying to string it together into a coherent narrative. And sometimes it seems like my advisor doesn‚Äôt realize how much work certain things are. I‚Äôve made so many horrible assumptions and had to cut corners on things because the level of detail for this to actually be worth looking into was too much for one year. Especially since I had to collect additional data while also trying to finish writing this fucking thesis.

I didn‚Äôt come to grad school wanting a PhD. My PI suggested it to me while I was a Masters student. I was unsure but he got my attention by mentioning how his previous PhDs make more money than him because they went into tech. He said he had a project in mind for me and so I begged him during my masters to let me start and I could do a masters thesis instead of the capstone track, so I can see if research was right for me before committing to PhD. He refused and just kept blowing me off telling me to focus on my classes. He kept telling me he thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúbuilt for this‚Äù. I am, in fact, not. 

Needless to say, I have a whole lit review chapter that needs to be written, and have to finish up these last two chapters as well as a short discussion. All in the next 2 weeks so I can send the draft to him a month before the defense. I have been working tirelessly sitting at my desk, not going to the gym, not keeping up with my hygiene, and still barely getting anywhere with the writing because there are just so many issues with the actual project for the last chapter I keep running into.

I want to quit. Cut my losses and just leave. I‚Äôll be jobless because my employment is contingent on me receiving my PhD, but I am not sure I care anymore. I just want this hell to be over. This last year I‚Äôve worked so much on my mental health and got to a better place but it feels like it‚Äôs all coming crashing down as this approaches. Idk if I have it in me to write the probably 40 additional pages this is going to take. I hate this field, I hate my project, and honestly, I am genuinely incompetent when it comes to this field. I just want this to end.


Edit:

Thank you everyone for your kind responses! It really helped me not feel alone. After having a small mental breakdown and a nice shower cry lol, I decided to give myself a little break, as I am overstressed. I think I overwhelmed myself comparing to other PhDs. Instead of aiming to meet their specific page counts or do things exactly the way they did, I‚Äôm just going to do what fits MY PhD. My advisor will let me know if it needs revisions and I will have time to address those as they come, rather than trying to do more than I may even need to.

1c6teq0,Feeling like dropping out of my Masters,"My masters degree has been kicking my ass. I am finishing up my second semester and I just feel no motivation to continue through. I had family issues (illness with my mother, took time to help her) pop up during my final semester of my undergraduate degree and continue through the summer heading into my Masters. I planned on deferring my offer for a year, but my advisor talked me out of it (I have worked on research with them for multiple years of my undergraduate degree). For the last two semesters, I have been bogged down with TA-ing multiple lab sections (and becoming the lead TA for the spring), classwork, and research. The lab, an introductory lab for my major, was filled with errors in the manuals and sample data. I spent some time in this semester to correct these, and raised concerns about their existence (these were the same materials I used as an undergrad, 4-5 years prior). My advisor has been dismissive of my lab concerns, stating that the research should be my only priority, which I strongly disagree with. They recommended that I take a course outside of the scope of my field, which I am most certainly going to fail in. 

  
The lab has caused issues, as a PhD student who has taught the lab for many semesters keeps using the error-filled materials and shown a lack of care and understanding in the material. The professor in charge of the lab keeps so busy that they didn't show up to a month's worth of our lab meetings, nor would they respond to email questions from other TAs. I ended up taking up some of the slack dropped by them and spent extra time to help the other TAs understand the materials or how to handle other lab responsibilities. 

  
My graduate program as a whole seems to completely given up as well. I still haven't been assigned a desk on campus, even when new students in the spring would recieve theirs. After constantly pestering the people in charge of assigning the desks, they told me they overassigned desks and decided to remove my name from the list. This response angered me, especially knowing that there are desks in the graduate offices that are barely used at all (one desk was only used once this semester, for 30 minutes, according to the graduate students surrounding the desk).

  
With the research, my advisor is under pressure from the department to produce results, and has passed this pressure onto me. With everything else I am handling, I do not have the time to spend 3 days (at minimum) monitoring the setup to make sure nothing breaks/leaks/catches fire/gets tampered with by others. 

  
I feel completely drained and battered from this program, and I know my grades this semester will reflect it. I wouldn't be surprised if I am dismissed this semester and honestly I want it to happen. The department and my advisor do not seem to care about anything other than research. All interest I had in the research, classes, and my major as a whole have gone down the drain. I have a job that wants me (they wanted to hire me right out of my undergraduate, but mentioned that they would eventually want me to gain my masters), so I won't be drowning or wandering aimlessly if I do leave the program. I just don't feel any motivation to do any work for my classes and research.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1c6teq0/feeling_like_dropping_out_of_my_masters/
1haiimu,Advice For Ph.D. Students feeling imposter syndrome,"
One thing they never tell you and you sort of have to figure it out on your own, is that no single scientist discovers absolute truth. Absolute truth is an order of magnitude greater than any one of us. Instead, our role as researchers is to observe and report. We spend the better part of a decade, taking a wild safari through our experiments and we report what we saw. We make stories about what we think it might mean, but they are ultimately just stories. Data backed stories, but fabrications none the less, meant to connect and interpret data points. These stories get tested by future experiments. We keep the ones that pass every test we (the scientific community, not just one researcher) throw at them, and we throw a lot of stories that fail out. 

A lot of the imposter syndrome I felt when I started came from feeling that I had to meet this unreasonably high bar of closing the book on my research question on answering all the questions with absolute certainty.. to uncover ‚Äúabsolute unshakable truth‚Äù but that‚Äôs not what science is. You have a research question, you have roughly three smaller scope versions of that question, and you run an experiment for each. Those experiments will never conclusively answer the question at the top, instead you‚Äôll learn that the answer is more complicated than you thought and merits further study. That‚Äôs the WHOLE PhD. Absolute truth is an order of magnitude above all of us, so instead aim for data backed stories to tell‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1haiimu/advice_for_phd_students_feeling_imposter_syndrome/
1matdvi,Working full time & in school,"Hi you all, I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or validation, so I'll take anything. I'm 26 YO, in the process of getting my second degree: my parents refused to help me with FAFSA paperwork unless I did what they wanted me to do the first time around. Now that I'm an independent student, I'm going back to pursue science.

I'm only about 60% of the way done with this degree after 3 years (including prereqs that I didn't have to take due to my first degree). Mostly due to me taking semesters off because I'm so tired from working my 40+ hours a week 8-5 job. I've failed classes because I've chosen sleep or having a day off over studying. Untreated ADHD and depression also aren't helping matters. I've decided to try to switch to an online program to see if that'll fix the burnout/pure exhaustion from school and work. 

  
My dilemma is this: I'm genuinely over working and going to school. I've dropped to part-time, and that's helped with the burnout a lot, but I really want to give up on this. I just know I'll regret it if I do. I do NEED at least a Master's to get into my dream field. My current full-time job is not at all what I want, but it is a ""career"". People are so happy with this job and company that they choose to stay until retirement.

 I guess what I'm asking is if you all think it's worth it to push through, no matter how long it takes. That's what I want to do, but I already feel silly for taking as long as I have. It's discouraging and very embarrassing for someone who graduated Magna Cum Laude in three years with her first Bachelor's.

The college I am in atm does not have a 'license' to teach _theoretical sciences_, that is, math and physics and the like --- which CS falls under. The other college is state-funded. Some people call it a _diploma mill_ but I don't think it is one. You see, they offer 8 semesters of 'exams'. You sign up for the college, they tell you to study their books. Then, you give their exams at the end of each semester. They offer no classes, you could take 3rd-party classes though. Or just read the books, as I do already. The exams are pretty difficult. That's why it's not a 'diploma mill'. My current college is, however, Brown as in Mill-y, its exams are crap-easy.

This last semester I took Data structures, I was able to learn them all but could not apply them since the exams were all questions such as what is the time complexity of sorting etc and minimal coding was involved.

Now summer is here and I am trying to learn python for interviews and to better my coding skills but don‚Äôt even know where to start and feel like I can‚Äôt stick to a tutorial as either they are too simple or too complex. 

I read that I should start a project and that will help me. The problem is I don‚Äôt know where to start and how to structure the program and how to not rely on chatgpt. I was able to get a project up and running using AI but it defeats the whole purpose.

Additionally, My dad was able to get me an internship a few days ago at his customers startup. The owner told me to review the code before I start and the program is so big that it makes me overwhelmed looking at thousands of lines. He said that they use a lot of ai which i am not sure how to even use with that big of a program to learn.

He also told me that he wants me to cold call people later to promote his company which I feel like defeats the whole purpose of the internship

I just feel so overwhelmed balancing the internship, my full time job and trying to learn and not sure how to prepare for next year.

Any advice is appreciated

We would be sharing job stats about which companies are hiring the most, interview updates from each of our circles, strategies to maximize chances to get interviews from applications..etc.Optionally Leetcode together as well.



Would prefer someone with motive for innovation in job search as in cold mailing, networking or any other unorthodox methods(if you have used some automation in this aspect thats really a plus) rather than mundane applications.



Should be available for atleast 15mins call everyday where we share updates on job search for the day. We would also act as **accountability partners** for each other , think pushing each other to plan more the next day, handling burnout, strategizing the upcoming weeks.

Read multiple self help books and watched 100s of hours of guides online, been tracking almost everyday for 2 years, so I could be of help of you.



We could Leetcode together as well but would prefer someone who spends time properly understanding the solution(may be even proving the solution or thinking till the extent to be confident it can be proved),who would give time to think;how did the author arrive at this solution -> What is the purpose of this line of code here, how does it go with the rest of lines-> Now that I know the solution, how would I have built this solution using the stuff I already know -> Where should I sort this technique into the list of inventory I have -> Now that core logic is assimilated are there any tiny tricks that I can use when coding in general.

I found thinking through things this was helps me pick up techniques really fast and been able to solve few Hards relatively early.

4twjhu,Should I take a year off to feel more in control with my own life?,"Hey guys, I feel very conflicted right now as I don't feel certain about going to university this September anymore. 

I initially planned to take out an educational loan to go to a UK university to get my engineering degree. Although the interest rate is only 3% per year, I need $120,000 to cover everything from food to tuition fees. There's a possibility of it turning into a full ride scholarship if I get good results. However, what if I can't cope in such a different environment? What if I don't like the uni I'm attending? And what with Brexit and them trying to decrease immigration, I feel like I'm throwing my non-existent money away before I get to even keep it.

The thought of taking a year off and using that time to get a driving licence plus a job seems so much more attractive now. I just don't feel ready to fly to the UK and start university yet. It feels so rushed and impulsive. It's like I'm just going along with my friends' decision and not my own. And I don't feel in control at all.

I want to gain more experience as a fresh 18 year old and then from there, do some more research about universities and scholarships. Then only can I make a decision I'm satisfied with.

In short, I just feel very overwhelmed and could use some advice. Am I overthinking this or are my fears justified? ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4twjhu/should_i_take_a_year_off_to_feel_more_in_control/

I had students write up more absences then the allowed amount. I will be honest not that it‚Äôs an excuse, but I‚Äôve had a lot of things going on this semester. I decided to pick up four classes this semester at my community college because they allow us. But quickly realized that four classes is not as easy as it sounds.

1mn1why,"Surviving an online asynchronous course during a job search, other issues, and fellowship disbursement (long post)","I'm a recent graduate from a PhD program in Experimental Psychology as of this past Thursday. My only obligations at this point are making sure my dissertation is finalized the way the graduate school wants it by September 15th at the latest. However, I made sure to format it the way they wanted it when I sent it back on Tuesday to them. They'll get back to me on August 15th with feedback too. If I do need to make changes, they'll be minimal hopefully since I made sure I followed the format.

For this past academic year other than June through August since I had to attend a week long conference, had an emergency room visit for a benign liver cyst, and a summer internship for 8 weeks, I've been totally unemployed and worked up to 10 hours a week at most. My only obligations in this case were applying to jobs with the help of vocational rehabilitation and working on my dissertation. My commitments were kept to the bare minimum mainly because I've had severe mental health issues ever since April 2022 and they were at their worst during the 2023-2024 academic year since that was when I got partially hospitalized and had to miss around 3 weeks of lecture and had to go online asynchronous. When I got a re-evaluation at 29 in August 2023, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD, and major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent. My neurodivergent conditions (that I already knew about when I was younger thankfully) are ASD level 1, ADHD-I, motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed. I also have what my neurodivergent affirming therapist and neurodivergent community call ""autistic burnout."" If you don't know what it is, definitely Google it or ask ChatGPT since it's not complex at all.

My last point is that I currently have fellowship money saved at the moment. This fellowship allows me to accept up to $35k. For every third I accept, which is $11,667, I need to do a year's worth of full time service credit as faculty, staff, or administration to keep it. I can also only get one year's max before I graduate too, which I already got since I was a visiting full time instructor in 2023-2024. This instructor position went horribly for me sadly since my ratings were in the 2s out of 5 on most categories and in the 1s out of 5 on those categories the last semester I taught (same semester I was partially hospitalized too). This was despite reusing all of the materials from folks who taught the class previously as well as their slides and activities. I plan on returning the $23,333 that I have left saved so I can avoid being the obligation of having to find a higher education position a year after I graduate before it turns into a loan. Even if it does signal to the state that gave me the fellowship that I'm done with trying to be in academia, I'm alright with it given that I didn't learn anything in graduate school at all. This isn't hyperbole either given that I only got by in coursework due to help from my cohort, advisors copyediting in what they wanted to see from me when I had issues following feedback (handling feedback is the worst for me), and more that I won't mention such as how my first PhD advisor dropped me.

Between all of these issues and more, I'm looking for advice on how I can manage myself for teaching this 8-week online asynchronous course I'll adjunct this upcoming semester. Notably, I don't need to upload any lectures or create any new material at all. I do need to grade though. I plan on reusing my old course shell from the last time I taught it in Spring 2023 since I made my own answer keys from the old materials I got when there weren't any at first.

For those also wondering, I'm only doing this so I can get income, even if it's meager. I don't have any interest in becoming a full-time instructor or anything like that at all given my awful experience when I tried last time. I only did that since my first PhD advisor and current PhD advisor thought going academic was the route for me. Listening to them was a mistake. I had an offer in June 2024 for an instructor position that was full-time and possibly renewable, but I declined it so I could stay with my parents and wrap up my dissertation. After I sent the email saying I declined (after I asked for a one week delay to make a decision too), they ghosted me and didn't even wish me luck. When I told my current advisor that I declined it two months later, he didn't seem to mind at all.

What can I do to make sure I survive (not thrive) teaching this course given everything I have to juggle in my case?",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1mn1why/surviving_an_online_asynchronous_course_during_a/

1hch30f,When your PhD viva feels like a personal attack,"I want to share my recent experience with my PhD viva, which turned out to be far from the celebration I had hoped for. To provide some context, my PhD was in a highly opinionated field: taxonomy. There isn‚Äôt a universally accepted way to define species, so it's common for people to have differing opinions, which they express at conferences and meetings. Typically, these discussions are civil, as we all understand we‚Äôre working towards the same goal, and rudeness is rare.

Unfortunately, my viva experience was a nightmare. I encountered a few factors that made me feel belittled and overwhelmed, leaving me with lingering negative emotions.

1. One of my examiners was particularly obnoxious and rude. He kept asking me questions that had no definitive answers, repeatedly interrupting me to insist I was wrong and that I should have known better.

2. Whenever we discussed a results chapter, he claimed he would have approached it differently (which is fair), but he also questioned why my supervisors allowed me to take that route. This made me feel like every chapter was flawed and worthless. I know that‚Äôs not true; as a postdoc, I collaborate with researchers around the world who appreciate my work. I‚Äôve presented my findings at both national and international conferences, and they have always been well received, even though my work is often controversial.

3. At one point, he said he couldn‚Äôt understand how my paper was approved for publication in a respected, peer-reviewed journal because he thought it was terrible.

4. Throughout my PhD, I applied a significant amount of mathematics to biology, but he seemed to struggle with this concept. He claimed that biology and mathematics don‚Äôt go together. What?! Math applies to nearly every aspect of life, especially in fields like bioinformatics.

To sum it up, I was always told that a PhD viva is meant to be a discussion about your work. Instead, mine felt like four hours of criticism, where I was made to feel wrong and ignorant. I passed with minor corrections, but I feel defeated. I feel like a fraud and dread announcing to anyone that I‚Äôve earned my doctorate. It feels undeserved, and all I want to do is cry.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hch30f/when_your_phd_viva_feels_like_a_personal_attack/

Hello, this is my first reddit post. It‚Äôs been two weeks since I defended my PhD and I am extremely burnt out. 

I have severe imposter syndrome. I was supposed to look for postdocs a year ago, but I felt anxious about finishing my dissertation and didn‚Äôt feel good enough to apply. So now I am in a stressful situation of looking for jobs, but I feel extremely depressed and unmotivated even though I am taking a break from the lab right now; I will go back to continue some of the work for a manuscript. I guess my personal life context: I am a foreign student, and my family (back home) is trying to marry me off asap and for them my phd means nothing since they don‚Äôt really care if women have careers. 

Currently I am applying to a bunch of jobs but I am overwhelmed with anxiety because of my family and also with the current funding situation & immigration. So I am wondering if I should apply for postdocs in Canada or Europe. 

I usually see a counselor, but they haven‚Äôt responded to my email after we took a break for my defense. I don‚Äôt know what to do right now. When I began my PhD, I was super enthusiastic and curious about research. However, now I feel like phd was a waste of my time.

1mytmr3,Gaslighting admin‚Ä¶,"I think I‚Äôm being gaslit by my DH and I‚Äôm so over it. The year before I came to my current institution, the department had some very significant upheavals (I won‚Äôt give details, it was in the national news). My first year I focused on developing my courses, doing the service I was specifically hired for, and getting a jump on my research (mainly because they outgoing DH didn‚Äôt understand a d*mn thing about pedagogy and it was my way of ensuring he couldn‚Äôt force me to give into student whining). I was assigned a student org but it had fallen apart in the year of upheaval. I didn‚Äôt know any students to get them involved and the current ‚Äúexec board‚Äù didn‚Äôt return emails or schedule org meetings and I just de-prioritized it and worked on what I believed to be time sensitive needs. 

ETA paragraph: my first week I had found a student that was supposed to help me get it going (ironically enough the new ‚Äúpresident‚Äù) and emails with the then president. At the end of the year after multiple emails to schedule kick off meetings I was ghosted. I finally got another student to step up and agree to be president this fall but then 3 days before the semester he backed out because he moved up his grad date and couldn‚Äôt do it. 4 days after that is when I was asked about it by DH. So back to original content‚Ä¶.

Cue this year, new DH new priorities. He emphasized the importance of the service role I was hired for and said he wanted to take it one step further. I told him what I needed, resources and timeline, to make that happen. Crickets since the. So I‚Äôve just been plodding ahead on that project. Sticking a pin in things I needed his input or approval and doing things I could in the meantime. 

The first week of classes I get asked about my student org. I say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt really exist and I‚Äôve been focusing on other things‚Äù. He says he wants to move forward. Cool I can do that, so I specifically go to his office and ask what he would consider an acceptable level of completion by the end of the week (student welcome where we cover the student orgs). He tells me just some information about it. Great, so I don‚Äôt need to choose a president by the ? No. Can I go ahead and schedule a call out meeting? Yes. 

I put together the information and schedule a call out meeting. Get to the welcome and a student announces in front of everyone, he is the president. I ask about it and he got a call from the admin assistant 11:30 the night before asking him to take over. I ask the DH about it. He says he has a timeline he‚Äôs working on and if I‚Äôm not going to meet that then decisions get made or something to that effect. I asked, ok but that‚Äôs why I specifically came and talked to you. At that point he kinda brushes that off and eventually says ‚Äúit‚Äôs lunch time, I‚Äôm not discussing this‚Äù. I said ok and walked away. Madder than, well pretty much anything. 

I emailed all passive aggressively (but not the immediately shit listed/fired level) apologizing for the complete misunderstanding and I can‚Äôt figure how I completely misunderstood everything he told me and asking for very clear deadlines on the other things I had been working on so I could better prioritize. 

His email back to me was crap, didn‚Äôt address the issue and most definitely did not admit he f*cked up and either A. Forgot our conversation or B. Doesn‚Äôt respect me at all and thinks I can‚Äôt do my job. 

So, in my experience admin never take responsibility, but this is this guys first year here, my second. If this is how it‚Äôs going to be, I know it will be hell. A friend is a DH in another department (their first year as DH) and was trying to justify his behavior but I just can‚Äôt buy it. This isn‚Äôt typical ‚Äúhe‚Äôs first week, overwhelmed and had to make a decision‚Äù. He straight did the opposite of what he told me needed done.

1ayhg37,"I've decided to be blunt, and it's working. (Long post, but intriguing, at least to me)","I, like so many others,  have had it with the more obnoxious habits undergrads seem to have developed (the helplessness, the neediness, the whining, the need to act panicked about things, etc).

So, one day I had a migraine coming on and my filter became a bit faulty. I became blunt in my responses to the more irritating behaviors. To my surprise, it worked out better than being tactful ever had. I tried to be blunt and call out the behaviors the next class, it worked even better the second time. Why is this? I have no idea, maybe I'm doing it in kind of a funny way so it helps them take the observations? I don't know. I would like to know.

Case in point, we had an inclass activity. They each got a term and a definition. They had to tell each other the definition they had and try to find the person who had the definition for their term. It was more structured then it sounds. Picture speed dating but with key terms.

Due to having to move, be engaged, and talk to another human they of course lost their minds. Claiming they didn't understand, all (or rather most) being just needy and helpless all at once. I have to give it to one girl, she didn't know her term. She Googled it and I saw her search for it on her phone.  I asked if she was looking up the term, she said yes, and I excessively praised her for taking some action to solve her own problem. 
Then a bunch of them pulled out their phones to look up the word. They clearly knew how, but had chosen not to. 

Anyway, once the on-slot of whining started, I told them to just stop talking for a second. I literally said, ""Yo! Stop for one second! Just stop talking!"" They did. I then said, ""First, what's with hitting the panic button so fast? No one is going to die, you won't get hurt, nothing bad is going to happen. We're playing a game. Stop taking everything so seriously. Struggle is part of learning. If you never struggle, you'll never learn."" I asked again why they had panicked, forcing them to think of reason. They realized, there was not a reason. They had defaulted to panic mode. 
They were exhausted by the end of the activity. I think students are used to getting out of doing things with the helpless routine and now lack mental stamina in a way. 

Another time I a student ask me something I had clearly already told the class. I noticed she had some tv show playing on her laptop that she was watching. I asked if it was a good show. She said ""yes."" I then said, ""maybe don't watch it in class. I told everyone that information and you were probably watching the show and missed it. I think that's the problem. I'm not repeating myself for TV. I love TV. I used to work in television. But if you listen to what's happening here and don't watch a show, I guarantee we will never have this exact problem again."" She agreed, and we moved on. 

What is this?! There's been no complaints to anyone above me, I eavesdrop on them all during lab and have heard zero rumblings of discontent. They have actually been friendlier and more engaged in class.

1mwx2uu,I feel like my master‚Äôs thesis is terrible - a few days before deadline,"My thesis is due in less than two weeks and I‚Äôm spiraling. While re-reading my literature review, I found a few mistakes and realized my research strategy was kind of weak because I missed a few papers. I even met with a librarian  but he probably didn‚Äôt throughly understand what I was looking for. At the time I wrote that section, I didn‚Äôt have the knowledge I do now. On top of that, I actually sent my first draft months ago and only got feedback in July, right before going on vacation, so I didn‚Äôt have time to fix anything anyway. I also wanted to wait for my PI‚Äôs feedback before changing anything, which left me stuck. Now I don‚Äôt have the time to add those papers, but I‚Äôm terrified of being called out. The thing is, these papers don‚Äôt really change anything since they are models that don‚Äôt apply to my population, but I still feel like I‚Äôm handing in something incomplete and mediocre.

My project was also way too heavy for a master‚Äôs. To the point where the postdoc in our team is furious because she feels like I got the most complex and publication worthy project. We didn‚Äôt have the time to run all the analyses that would have made the study rock solid, so we just settled for what we had. We still got a lot of results, but not enough to feel 100% complete.

A research assistant tried to reassure me by saying a master‚Äôs thesis is really just proof that you did research for two years and that you understand it, not a perfect study. She also told me my PI‚Äôs students have never gotten major corrections in her entire career (25 years+). Instead of calming me down, that actually made me feel worse, because now I feel like if I do get major corrections I‚Äôll forever be remembered as the one student who ruined the streak.

So, my advisor sends me papers that he finds fairly often, probably every other week or so. I usually just pin the email, download the PDF, and add it to my notes document under a section titled ""Papers To Read""... but I don't actually read the entire paper until a long time later. I might skim it quickly to see the plots my advisor wanted me to see, but I don't read it in detail right away. And then, theoretically, sometime in the future, I will spend a couple weeks doing *nothing* but reading papers. 

I have to admit that I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of papers I have on my ""to read"" list, plus the mental effort/time it takes to read and *actually* understand even ONE paper is very daunting. I want to read the entire thing and take notes on it as well - highlight the important parts, and summarize its key findings and equations in my notes document - so that I can keep everything I've learned organized. And doing all this for one paper could take an entire day. I know they say ""just read the abstract and look at the figures"", but if I don't do all this, how will I actually remember what I've learned? 

I have something like 20-30 papers on my list of papers I intend on reading, either ones my advisor sent me, or ones that I found but didn't feel like reading fully at the time. 

I was just wondering if this experience is something you all relate to. Please let me know if this is relatable and tell me about your experience - for example, how often does your advisor send you new papers, and do you read them right away, or fall behind? Thanks :) ",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1kfsdm1/is_it_normal_to_fall_behind_on_reading_papers/
1mwsi32,How do people become an expert through a PhD?,"Hi,

I am a rising 2nd year STEM PhD student at a T10 school. I never realized until I boarded on my PhD that I have been suffering from imposter syndrome since many years, maybe, since my high school time. However, I diagnosed myself by noticing that I am unnecessarily making my life more difficult. Or, maybe, I am wrong.  
Before I joined the PhD program, I'd articulated my interest in learning/utilizing a lot of new techniques. Interestingly, the nature of the research my PI conducts is in complete agreement with what I always have dreamt of and I should emphasize it is very unique(please believe me!). My professor is pushing a particular frontier in biology by developing engineering tools. To date, different students in the lab used to develop and take care of those tools individually. Therefore, when they graduate, they might be able to identify themselves as experts in those particular fields. But the project I work on demands the application of all of those tools to establish proofs so that our approach can be proven practical in real cases. No doubt, I will be able to publish a lot of papers from this project. But I am afraid as I am only going to apply a lot of techniques to prove something to be practical, I might have only shallow knowledge about all of them. It's like becoming jack of all trades but master of none. Moreover, I don't consider myself a prodigy, rather I would potray myself as merely a science enthusiast. It might not be possible for me to learn and be expert on all of these tools what our lab develops within my limited PhD period. How should I make my plan so that I can call myself an expert/master on at least one of the tools after I graduate? Or, how should I change my perspective about ""expert""? What should anyone expect to get from his PhD?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mwsi32/how_do_people_become_an_expert_through_a_phd/

1mp5on9,1st Year - Fallen Far Behind,"Tldr:

\- Failed every quiz so far (Passing is 70, not even close, below 50%)

\- Extremely behind on course material (Unable to participate in class or study groups)

\- Deteriorating physical and mental health

\- Considering LOA, Withdrawing, or Staying. All options are on the table.

\- Tried academic support. Trying to get counseling.

Hi everyone,

I never thought I would be in this situation, but I have fallen very far behind. I don't think this is sustainable, and I am not sure I can recover from this. My DO school is P/F, so I'm not trying to aim for perfection. Day by day I make small goals for myself to determine what I need to learn and to show improvements. It's worked to an extent, but it isn't allowing me to catch up. I've been told the 1st semester is all about getting settled into the pace and curriculum, but I don't even think I am close. I really am far behind (unable to participate in class, group work, or even study with other peers. Nothing is sticking.), and I take responsibility for that. My study skills need to be improved. It is clear that I got away with things going all the way back to HS.

I did meet with academic support to get help. It has helped, and I have improved marginally. But, I don't think it'll be enough. My health, physical and mental, has not been great, and I actually had a medical emergency right before medical school (we knew it was a possibility due to genetics but it is still extremely rare for it to progress suddenly at my age. Deferring a year was not possible under my med school's policies). I also received some abnormal lab results earlier this year that helped me understand a lot about my struggles in undergrad. I was able to address this and improved my diet, exercise, and wellness. It's frustrating that 7 months of progress have been undone just these past few weeks. I don't want to give up; however, I also have to be realistic, and I am reaching out to you all for advice.

Any help would be appreciated. I've been spiraling and unable to access my school's counseling services. They appear to be overwhelmed, and I get it, but my coping methods are not working now.

What would be most helpful is to be advised on the implications of a LOA and/or staying for the semester. I know we're still early into the semester (our first exam hasn't even happened but is coming up soon). Unfortunately, I would estimate that I only know about 10% of the exam's material (0 pathologies, some pathways to at least get the basic).

I'm open to anything. I've thought about trying to stay and hopefully catch up. Of course this is the best scenario if I can successfully do this. But, I also wonder if it'd be better to withdraw and/or request a LOA. We're still early enough in the semester to get a partial refund. What I don't want is to have to repeat the year anyway or get dismissed. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not cut out for this.

Here's some additional context:

\- You get a Wf if you withdraw while not being academically ""satisfactory"". I don't know if this applies to me. We have a bigger quiz today.

\- We get practice questions and go over them in class. The best I've gotten is around a third correct.

\- I still want to be a physician, but I also am interested in other careers. My lab results and medical emergency really changed my perspective on what I value. I now care most about my health, my friends/family, and happiness.

  
Update: Marginal improvements happened. Based on my circumstances, timing, and advice I received from the school and administration, it doesn't make sense to leave now. School is supportive, which I am grateful for, so I'm gonna give it a go. I might have to take a LOA and/or withdraw at a later date, but I could also come back and develop sustainable improvements. I really want to see this through and give it a go. If it doesn't work out, I'll know I've done my best.

1mp9inw,Is a PhD worth it or should I dedicate to full time applications?,"
Hi y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm writing this to get some extra perspectives on what to do and would really appreciate y‚Äôall‚Äôs comments.

I‚Äôm about to enter my second year as a PhD student (no topic and no advisor). Admittedly the only reason I‚Äôm this far in is purely because I wasn‚Äôt able to find a full time job after I graduated with my masters (my fault as I started looking too late). My issue right now is that I‚Äôm miserable in my PhD. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm burnt out or anything else but I just have no motivation other than the bare minimum. And thus I‚Äôve been seeing a PhD as a way to keep myself financially afloat (I work as a TA which fully covers tuition and a stipend that covers for the rest).

I‚Äôve been trying to apply to full time positions while but I haven‚Äôt had any luck. This last summer I was able to get an internship and tried negotiating with the company to hire me full on, but they responded by saying their expectation is to be with me until I graduate. After talking with some friends, they recommended to me that I should just ditch the PhD and dedicate myself full time to leetcode and applications. I just don‚Äôt know if that is the right choice as with one I may be miserable but at least I have a job and can apply to a decent amount of jobs or have no income, coast on my savings for who knows how long, and apply to more jobs.

I‚Äôve tried coming with lists of pros and cons for both ideas and to summarize the big points I have this:

PhD pro:
* Have income
* Open opportunities for internships to then spin into full time 
* Am still learning in the career I love
Cons:
* I would hate my life
* Wouldn‚Äôt be putting 100% into it
* Could potentially limit my options as a PhD is incredibly specialized

Dropping out pros:
* mental health
* Able to dedicate more time for DSA prep and applications
Cons:
* will have to explain a 1 year gap (graduated masters in 2024)
* No income
* At the whim of the cs market

I know having no income can be negated by taking up some non-cs job but how would that make me look on my resume?

What do yall think about my situation?

TLDR; PhD student that is severely burnt out who doesn‚Äôt know if continuing or dropping out to pursue full time applications is worth it.

After getting my master‚Äôs degree, I took a three month break then jumped right into my PhD program. I have four more classes to take until I‚Äôm done my coursework portion of my PhD, then I go straight to research and drafting my thesis.

Truly? I am so worn out. So beaten down with everything. Words cannot even describe the chronic exhaustion and unhappiness I feel. Imposter syndrome is starting to hit hard but that‚Äôs not even the worst part (yet). I am just so physically and mentally exhausted from taking college courses and doing research for the last seven years. I am dreading going to class on Wednesday. I crave change and something more outside of academia.

I want to get a job so badly but since the job market is so horrid, it‚Äôs been very difficult to find one in my field that I would be mostly happy with. I have been applying to public sector jobs since February and even though I made progress in quite a few interviews, I was never the chosen candidate. I‚Äôm trying to not lose the momentum of applying but it gets to a point where I applied to as many jobs as I could find.

8sw9gt,[residency]Why you should do Family Medicine - a Resident's Perspective,"Hey everyone!  I'm a PGY-3 graduating in two days.  I go to an academic tertiary care center and graduated from a top public Midwest medical school and couples matched with my wife who does internal med.  For the right person, family medicine can be an amazing opportunity with plenty of impact in your patient's life and also a great lifestyle as well.  Onto the good stuff.

**The Years**

* PGY-1: This is the hardest year of residency from an hours standpoint as you do the most inpatient intern year.  It ranges from the ob floor, general medicine floor, and ICU.  Throughout this year you'll also have clinic either within the rotation itself or in blocks.  Be prepared for a whirlwind experience and you'll likely average close to 60 hours a week.

* PGY-2: Easier hours wise, but still can be daunting.  You're now considered a ""senior"" so you'll be taking charge on the inpatient service, and expected to see a higher number of patient's during your clinic blocks.  However, this year is more outpatient heavy, so expect more office type hours.  You also get to do more off service rotations.  

* PGY-3: Senior on campus.  Should be the easiest year of your residency.  Again, you'll be leading inpatient teams and be the most senior resident on-call, but hopefully you've gained enough experience your second year that you feel more than able third year.  I really enjoyed this year and spent more time on teaching, efficiency and research.  Your outpatient clinic also ramps up and I saw up to 10 in a half day.  Also, this is the most outpatient of all the years plus elective time so hours are much better.  You'll also be rotating in a lot of different departments so while it may feel like 3rd year of medical school, you can go to each specialty you visit with very specific questions.  I also found that specialties were very appreciative of the work we did and very open to teaching and helping figure out if that was something we could manage ourselves or refer.  Third year is also when you find a job which is incredibly easy.  My wife matched for fellowship and I had vacation in 4 weeks.  I started applying to her city and had 6 different interviews lined up for that one week of vacation in a New England city.  I'd say I average 50 hours or less third year.

**Typical inpatient day:**


* 6:45-receive sign out from overnight team

* 7:00-8:30 - preround

* 8:30-11:00 - round

* 11:00-12:00 - call consultants, notes, orders

* 12:00-1:00 - noon conference/lunch

* 1:00-6:00 - admissions, follow up on patients, learning, etc. then sign out

**Outpatient day:**

* 8-12 - see patients

* 12-1 - conference

* 1-5 - see patients

To talk more about the outpatient world you'll end up in a variety of clinics.  My primary two clinics were the acute care clinic (cellulitis, asthma exacerbation, URI's, sore throats, etc.), continuity of care clinic (diabetes, HTN, annual physical exams).  We also rotated through other clinics including procedure clinic (IUD's, Nexplanons, shave, excision, and punch biopsies, treadmill stress test, colposcopies) our MSK/sports medicine clinic (injections, ultrasound, MSK issues) and also nursing home rounds (travel to the nursing home and round on patients) and also free medical clinic work.  Of course when you rotate on a different specialty you'll experience their flavor of medicine.  Also procedures were not limited to the procedure clinic.  Simple procedures like cryo, Nexplanon, punch biopsies and joint injections I did during all clinics.  

**Call:** We had weekend call coverage where you would cover a 12 hour shift depending on the rotation you were on.  Night float covered Sunday night-Saturday morning with three 12 hour shifts on the weekend to cover.  It was easy to trade call shifts.  Different places have different schedules.

Procedures: Covered in the procedure clinic.  I should also mention that some residencies will train you to do c-sections, are very active in you first assisting in surgery, or have you do screening colonoscopies/endoscopy.  

**Fellowships:** Sports medicine, geriatric, ob (train to do c-sections), hospitalist, medical education, informatics, sleep.  All generally are one year fellowships.  

**Who is a good fit in family medicine?**

* You want to do it all, or you want to not do it all.  It is very easy to create a schedule that works for you.  Want to be the do it all doctor who rounds on his inpatients, sees clinic patients, covers the ER, and then delivers babies?  Rural FM is for you.  Want to make six figures working part-time at an urgent care?  Easy.  For full scope FM you'll be restricted to rural areas, but for everything else you can go rural, urban and suburban with jobs available everywhere.  I'll generally talk about outpatient FM as that's the trend for most graduates.  

*  You enjoy talking with patients and like having continuity.  I've watched patients lose 50 lbs during my residency.  I've seen a diabetic exercise and lose weight and his A1c is now 5.1 completely off of medicine.  Though you also see that cirrhotic slowly circle the drain and pass away.  The diabetic wound that turns into an amputation.  You do goals of care conversations for your dying patients.  All my nursing home patients who I had at the beginning of residency have passed away.  I convinced one of them to go onto hospice.  I've delivered babies and seen them through the first years of life which is really incredible (or at least I think it is).  

* Most of medicine fascinates you.  I get to dabble in a little bit of everyone's field.  I'm currently working up a primary hyperthyroidism, treated chlamydia, sent a smoker to ENT for a laryngoscope for hoarseness, had to look up the work up for abnormal uterine bleeding, discussed PSA testing the list goes on.

* You want people to live their best life.  This applies to all of medicine, but in family medicine this means an emphasis on prevention and success can look different.  Instead of performing the heart saving cath, you counsel on diet, exercise and get appropriate people on a statin.  Instead of cutting out the cancer in the colon you convince people to get colonoscopies or do FIT testing.  There isn't that instant rush like other specialties, but it's very rewarding in it's own right.  

* Training: Our residency is only three years and it is definitely not the hardest one out there.  

**Cons:**

* Money: We're one of the lowest paid specialties.  Lifestyle wise it's very cush, but you're not pulling in half a million like derm does with their office life.    

* The unknown: You have to be okay with uncertainty.  Not every cough is lung cancer and not every cough needs a chest x-ray, but when you miss something, which will happen to you eventually as not everything is textbook, it can be devastating.  Along those lines, you can't know everything and you will hit things that you need to look up or maybe refer before you really want to.  

* Prestige: While a good FM doc is generally well respected it certainly isn't prestigious.  That being said, everyone in FM is generally down to earth and great to hang out with.

* Burnout: Some patients are nasty and that's just a fact of life.  You have to fight insurance companies.  The day is very fast paced and you'll see a lot of patients and documentation is a drag.  

I really love FM and am excited for my career.  I will be working slightly outside of a major Northeastern city working 4 days a week 8-5.  I will have occasional phone call which goes through a nurse triage line.  This generally means I get 1-2 calls when I'm on phone call.  I can't be drunk/altered, otherwise no restrictions.  I'll be making around 240k with bonuses.  

My wife is going to be a fellow in some internal med subspecialty and I'm excited to support her in her career.  I envision myself going part time shortly after she becomes an attending.  

For the right person FM can be a really rewarding career and nice lifestyle.  Let me know if you have any questions!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sw9gt/residencywhy_you_should_do_family_medicine_a/

Our first post-leave meeting, he told me he's not sure about working with me anymore, and went as far as telling me that he'd vouch for me to a new advisor. I didn't expect this at all, and I feel devastated. Do I try to show him that I can do better? Do I just cut my losses?



Longer explanation: for the first three years I worked with my advisor, we had a great relationship. He even supported me in taking it easy when I got PTSD my second year. During my fourth year, things started to feel tense because I couldn't get him drafts fast enough. I was able to pick up speed a bit once I got an ADHD diagnosis and was properly medicated, but it still wasn't enough for him.
In my fifth year, things were civil, but a little ugly. I was exhausted, he was always telling me that I wasn't working fast enough, and I was increasingly demoralized. It seemed like, ""everyone else can meet these deadlines -- why can't you?"" I eventually brought in a mediator because it seemed like we were talking past each other. That year, we scheduled my defense three different times, but I just couldn't get things finished.
Going into my sixth year, he said he wasn't sure what to do with me and thought I should maybe transfer to a different lab. I pointed out how much faster I'd begun to work (I had just needed more writing practice). He said he'd give me one more semester of funding, and that I'd have to self-fund after that. Fair to me!
Well, a month later, I totally burnt out. It was such an awful feeling, but I told him I should go on medical leave because my brain just wouldn't work anymore. He was supportive, we developed a plan for when I got back, I told him I'd fund myself moving forward, we both *signed an agreement* basically saying we were committed to each other, and then I took 9 months to take care of myself and recover. 
In that time, I also got an autism diagnosis, which helped me to understand why I had burnt out (four years of numerous leadership roles, non-stop communication, and developing a paper?? How could I not burn out!).
I'm coming back from medical leave now, and I'm *jazzed*. I developed a new graduation timeline, I made a huge list of what I need to finish, and I felt SO prepared to get back to it.
I sent him my timeline, and thought he'd appreciate that I was being proactive.
Turns out that I... Missed something? When we met, he told me it actually made him worried that I sent him the timeline, I was being too eager, the timeline was too aggressive, and I was just repeating mistakes I've made before.
I told him that I'm happy to adjust the timeline, but also that I have way more energy than I did before because I had rested for 9 months. 
He kept repeating that he just ""doesn't feel confident"" about working with me.
Finally, through tears I said, ""it seems like there's nothing I can do to help you trust me other than showing you that things are different. And I don't want to be in a situation again where I can tell that you don't think I can do this. That's not good for either of us.""

I stand by what I said, but now I feel torn between so many thoughts: 

1) over time, I've become furious that he would even consider abandoning me. My brain broke because I had numerous undiagnosed disabilities. But up until it broke, I absolutely kicked ass. I won awards, I started new clubs, I got more support for grad students in my department, and I even took over planning a conference for him. So a big part of me is like, ""f--k him. I deserve people who stick with me, even when things are hard.""

2) I'm worried that I must have really messed up somehow without realizing it. I'm incredibly anxious, so I'm very self-reflective. I don't think I was ever out of line when I tried resolving our previous issues. It seems like he must have really gotten sick of me though if he decided to give up on me after I came back from medical leave...

3) should I try to convince him to work with me again because that probably my fastest route to graduating? Or is it going to feel gross because now I know how little he values my work? 
   
4) Also... Is this ableism? It's hard to look at all this and not think that he ditched me because I wasn't able to keep up my cheery and easygoing demeanor once I started to burn out. 

5) should I take this opportunity to start ""fresh""? I didn't really like my research anyway, but all of my chapters are kind of written already. Do I hop over to a related field, but scrap some of what I have? I feel like I'll be looking at another three years of work if I go that route, but I might actually enjoy it.

This whole thing just feels really icky and confusing. We used to get along so well, and he was so chill and understanding. Now it seems like he's cold. I don't know if I should fight for him, yell at him, or leave quietly.

Advice?,"As my title says, I'm about to start a PhD in neuroscience next month, and due to a variety of factors (poor mental health, financial stress, death in my family) I'm exhausted and dreading starting. On top of that with everything happening with funding cuts ive been thinking more and more that I don't want to go into academia, and am unsure if I want to continue in research. This sucks because doing research has been the only thing in my life that I have actively adored, I actually completely switched fields to pursue a PhD in neuroscience (went back to school part time for two years to get prerequisites after getting my masters in a semi related field). But after all that I'm starting to have second thoughts about continuing.

I‚Äôm currently a doctoral student and I‚Äôm on the verge of dropping out. I‚Äôm a Black Male and I‚Äôm having a hard time staying in my program given current events (and quite frankly even before them because I‚Äôve always been sensitive to the injustice)

I‚Äôm tired of having to do other people‚Äôs work and getting ridiculed for it when I make one mistake. My coworkers make mistakes and my supervisors make no fuss about it. I do something and I‚Äôve been told this field isn‚Äôt for me, that I‚Äôm only a nice person and nothing more.

This might sound incoherent and I apologize but I‚Äôm mad as all hell and fucking tired quite frankly. I don‚Äôt think I have it in me to do this for another year.

1i48o1m,Is it worth it for me to apply to grad school right now?,"So, here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm extremely burnt out and I want to take a gap year (or even just a gap half-year). I‚Äôve been neglecting my mental health a lot over the last 2 years and I‚Äôve just started therapy, which has helped me unpack some things. 4th year has been pretty demanding and while I initially intended to keep up with stuff like scholarship applications, reaching out to professors, and asking for LORs, I really have not accomplished any of these things. I do well in my classes, but I don‚Äôt make the effort to get to know my profs and I‚Äôm not involved in many extracurriculars. The clock‚Äôs ticking and I‚Äôm anxious and I do not think that I can realistically do any of this at the moment, especially during a busy semester like this. But if I took a gap year, I think I could come up with a good plan of what to do and figure everything out. I also had a lab-based class last semester where I kept making careless mistakes and my lab partner was visibly annoyed at me, which has me second-guessing if I‚Äôm cut out for this line of work. I‚Äôve signed up for a field course in the spring, have just joined a local field naturalists club, and am applying for summer internships for my program, so those‚Äôll hopefully help me figure that out.



I‚Äôm also second-guessing what I want to do my Master‚Äôs in (I‚Äôm a biology student and was thinking of doing my Master‚Äôs in bio, but am now also entertaining the thought of doing it in journalism). I want to make some more money and hopefully learn some practical skills that I‚Äôve been neglecting (like learning how to drive). I also strongly suspect that I might have ADHD and want to get tested for that ‚Äî I think it would be better to go into grad school being properly medicated and having better study strategies rather than risking crashing and burning and dropping out. I think the ADHD might be partly responsible for the burnout I‚Äôve been experiencing lately and my time management skills are atrocious. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have enough time to pursue hobbies outside of academia anymore just because I‚Äôm a serial procrastinator and I keep getting overwhelmed way too easily.



I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have had my tuition paid for by my parents throughout my undergrad, something that I‚Äôm thankful for. Both of my parents think that taking a gap year would be a huge mistake and that I‚Äôd regret it ‚Äî personally, I don‚Äôt think so. I live in a different city than them, so if I did this, I wouldn't be freeloading and I'd ideally be less financially reliant on them. They are urging me to apply for grad school right now and then just defer if I really need to, but since I‚Äôm pretty dead-set on taking this gap, I think that‚Äôd be a waste of time and money. They‚Äôve offered to cover application fee costs, but that would make me feel even worse ‚Äî I really don‚Äôt want to waste my parents‚Äô money on this. Every time I think about applying right now, I swear my brain enters fight-or-flight mode and I tense up and suddenly feel overwhelmed by everything. It even distracts me from properly studying for my current classes. When I think about taking a gap year, I can suddenly focus and feel calm. I think that‚Äôs my body telling me that I need a break. I just don‚Äôt know how to break the news to my parents. Should I bite the bullet and just apply for grad school, or should I take the gap year?



TL;DR: Want to take a gap year because of burnout, wanting to get more practical experience, and wanting to make more money. Parents don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea and want me to apply anyways. I‚Äôm extremely ill-prepared and anxious and just don‚Äôt want to think about it at the moment.

1ftqtcj,My desire to teach was killed,"Yesterday, I was teaching one of the courses. For the lecture, it was kind of repetitive to wrap up the chapter. I went through the slides.

Then, I gave them the worksheet to work on, which I always do. One of the students (he always asks questions but in a way that doesn‚Äôt relate to what I talk about or the questions that I just answered to another student), he asked for help. I went to his desk and see. He was not even asking questions just telling me how to solve the problem all in a wrong way.

1kgx7vx,Questioning my passion after meeting with former advisor (advice needed),"Hello everyone! Hope you're having a great spring term. I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I really need some advice about possibly going back to school after just finishing my MA in art history (focus of Ancient Greek sculpture). I would like to eventually shoot for a PhD. During my art history MA program, she advised me that if I wanted to eventually obtain a PhD in our field, I would have to prove a graduate level understanding of both Greek and Latin. She suggested I try to complete another MA, but in Classics. In the meantime, I've been looking into fully-funded MA programs in Classics (super competitive).

I had a meeting with her yesterday that shook me. She continually reiterated that I had to be serious about a PhD program as they are a lot of work and that I can't fall behind like I did in the MA program I just finished (I took 2.5 years years instead of the usual 2 years). I did take some time off from the program for ""personal reasons"" (personal reasons = major imposter syndrome + managing Type 1 Bipolar and PTSD, I never told her this as I believed it to be unprofessional to disclose that information and we didn't have a relationship where I was comfortable telling her my reasons so I just told her I personally needed some time off). She also insisted that I probably didn't enjoy writing and researching my thesis as much as I did because ""it's fun for people who are good at this and enjoy doing this and if it wasn't fun for you, you probably weren't good at it"" (note: managing those personal reasons were a big part of the not-so-fun aspect of writing my thesis). She ended the meeting with saying, ""You're the only one who knows if this is right for you.""

Since then, I've been managing these personal reasons very well (the right meds, therapy, etc.). 

My plan is this: talk to the Director of Graduate Studies for the Classics Department from the university I just graduated from about admissions and creating a strong application. I also plan on taking a Latin course and Greek course this fall term (Catallus and Euripedes) as a non-degree seeking student to prove on my application that I currently know Greek and Latin (I have taken 3 years of Greek and 1.5 years of Latin through different courses and a post-bacc I participated in, but that was before this MA program). I also want to enroll in an MA program where I can incorporate a Digital Humanities aspect in my thesis as I have a minor in that from undergrad and want to use that in my research.

What advice do you all have? What questions should I be asking myself? Thank you for taking the time in reading this post, and have a nice day.

1mklpar,Scrub Tech being borderline abusive,"Im a 4th year on sub-I out of state. My family including my 1 year old child are back home and I miss them dearly but I have been pouring that into my rotation, working hard, being early, staying late. Have yet to have an <12 hour day. Generally I‚Äôm someone who gets along well with OR staff and have befriended lots of scrub techs/nurses over the past year of clinicals but from the first day scrubbing with this tech I knew it was going to be a nightmare.
When the other medical student with me and I went to introduce ourselves she ignored us. Flat out did not respond or say hello at all. Okay. We were at least 2 feet away from her table and she yelled at us to back off. Whatever. Then when we went to scrub in (after grabbing our own things) she said ‚Äúuh-uh, I‚Äôm not having 2 med students scrub in. This isn‚Äôt a fucking day care.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it. One of the PA‚Äôs must have quietly said something to her because when the attending came in she ranted about how she isn‚Äôt allowed to say anything or protect her sterile field from medical students and made us look bad as if we said something to her which we didn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm on my second week now and I feel like I‚Äôm being bullied. She has somewhat chilled out on the other student (male) but still gets on me about everything I do. I am never supposed to come in the main doors, which is fine. Today I had to carry tons of supplies for a splint because our cart was in use in another OR. I came all the way around the back and she told me when I bring in casting supplies I‚Äôm SUPPOSED to use the otherwise forbidden main doors and had me carry these handfuls of stuff all the way around and through the main doors just because. This was among so many other things she has been on me about, it‚Äôs as if I can‚Äôt do anything without her correcting me in some way. 

I have been nothing but polite and gracious to her, greeting her in the mornings, saying please and thank you, not letting my agitation show but I‚Äôm getting exhausted. 

I think a lot of this is because I am a female and I am attractive (not trying to toot my own horn, but I put in effort and I know I‚Äôm at least above average looking.) I don‚Äôt know if there is a good solution, just ranting about how much it sucks to be trying your best, lonely away from home, sleeping very little, and bullied for 14 hours by someone for no reason other than she can.

1mlpn6f,Paying up my Intellectual Debt,"I want to share how I'm getting on track, and perhaps this might help a lot of the guys stydying CS or wanting to get better at it.

So my story goes like this. I was a top class student in HS, in one of the top highschools in my country, (the type who goes to maths olympiads). By the time i graduated from there at 17, I was completely burned out. I went to college, passed it without much issues, was even ranked among top 10. But the issue was ""I didn't know sh\*t"" by the time i graduated. Since year 1, i was put behind by dudes who were programming since 12, and I was like ""This is perhaps not for me, i'm too theoretical for this"". The teachers on the hand, considered these guys level as the standard and just moved on; Data structures, linked lists, graphs .... etc.

Around 3rd year, final exam in compilers, was to code a mini-compiler from scratch, design a language ... etc within like 4 hours. I prepared for it a night before following a tutorial. The day of the exam, I just replicated the exact tutorial as if I had sharingan. Even the top students couldn't compete. I got first, but the truth is I never fucking understood ""Why"" i do this or that. I simply do it ! This was my pattern for years to come.

I graduated in 2018, worked at IBM for a while, then for a startup in Silicon Valley, then another one in Hong Kong. Yet with 7 years of experience, I spent it feeling like a fraud tbh. Work requires results, and I was good at results. Finding the solution regardless of how or why it works. Ex; I worked on a supercomputer project in my IBM days, a 50 petabytes migration of data, I couldn't write a SQL query without checking manual every damn time. Because my head was always saying ""You can go back to learn this later"", and I never did. There is always something more urgent.

Most guys don't know there were people vibe coding before AI. I was one of them! Just gluing code from here and there, without actually understanding what the code does, it simply gets you what you want.

I was reading a book by Disjkstra last week, and he was talking about ""GCD algorithm"", the great common divisor of 2 numbers. Elementary school level, right?. Yeah, i didn't know how to calculate it! I said Ok, perhaps I am a bit rusty. I pulled out VSCode, and wanted to implement the algorithm, I WASN't F\*CKING SURE HOW TO WRITE A FOR LOOP. Because for the last 2 years, i've been overlying on AI that i never wrote a damn line on my own!! I felt embarassed, long story short, I got to work to pay this intellectual debt because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I set up a plan for August. It goes like this : Catch up on High School maths, freshman year programming, Data Structures, Algorithms & complexity, python, SQL, and lastly linux. Then get to advanced discrete maths, competitive programming, reading code like I read english.

I put up the rule of : 200 hours. If I dedicated 200 hours of pure focus for humbly learning this, i might be proud of the level i'll achieve. My principle is : stay unapologetically Humble to go back to primary school lessons if necessary, and honest with myself of what I know and what I don't.

**## WEEK 1**

This is a program I vibe coded before starting to track my studying hours. On **day 1**, I went over my high school maths books, functions derivatives, calculus, arithmetics, vector spaces, differential equations... I uploaded that in my mind, passed a couple of high school exams to get it in there.

around middle **day 2**, i started with a [""noob"" level programming exercices](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/pierre-antoine.champin/enseignement/algo/exercices/index.pdf), (it's in french), like ""write a minimum function"" level. Humble, remember?

By the time i ended up the series, I was like ""Wow, now i can write a fibonacci recursively"", and GCD algorithm was a piece of cake.

**Day 3**, I read the entire book ""Computer Science Distilled"" cover to cover, and implemented each algorithm there, from simple min max, to graphs. IT WAS AMAZING. Like seriously buy a physical copy to support the author, he deserves it. At this point, I was confident. I knew recursion, backtracking, binary trees, sorting algorithms, when you use dynamic programming and when you use divide and conquer... etc. It all connected. Beware not to make my mistake and get stuck trying to solve a problem you are not equiped to solve yet, ( i spent 3 hours trying to solve 8 Queen's Puzzle to understand backtracking, while my recursivity skills were wacky)

**Day 4**, I went through the python official documentation, and just understand and try everything. By the time i finished, I was able to create a class, notations, lambda functions ... etc. Then i moved on to the algorithms and Data Structures. This was the plan.

My principle was this : From left to right. Everytime i start a new thing, CTRL-A + DEL. NO AI CODE GENERATION. If i get stuck somewhere, I ask for ""hints"" or ""bug lines"", never code

And man WOW. I couldn't believe myself. The repitition of having to reimplement everything everytime made me able to just write a graph on move within a trie with ease. By the end, i took a look at an algorithmics MIT exam, and I was able to understand every question and answer most of them. heck, i was able to code them in my sleep. This is a sample question that looked like mandarin to me just, a week ago, i was instantly being able to tell it's False, and implement it with ease.

**Day 5-6** was about SQL, I had to go through everything from scratch following this Cheat Sheet. Created a database, tables, data and did all sorts of scenarios on it. Then I finished by going through a complete discrete maths problems ( [part I](https://itk.ilstu.edu/faculty/chungli/DIS300/dis300v1.pdf) and [part II](https://itk.ilstu.edu/faculty/chungli/DIS300/dis300v2.pdf) )

Around the end of part II, i stumbled on euclid's algorithm and I could understand it all in 1 glance. Even the floor division notation ( which you'll learn in part I ). and I was like ""Euclid's a smart dude"", i could see the beauty in this.

**What's the plan for week II ?**

It will be about exercices and exams. I have this set that I will go through one by one, and the principle is to do it (with time constraints). Alongside a set of exams around the end of the week.

Also I will go through this Algorithmics book now that I am equiped with the maths necessary and the complete understanding of the DSA.

I hope this post was helpful to those wanting to master the CS craft. It's very possible and easy, it only requires dedication. I was lucky to have a month for myself, that i'm dedicating completely to this study.

**Regarding Study Sessions :**

How i manage over 11 hours a day of work? Which some of you might see as ""too much"" or odd. ( Btw, this was a rythm I had for the 3 years of high school non stop , so I have a sort of muscle memory regarding long hours focus and dedication, and I have tips of this intense work already crafted and ready ). I don't recommend you going this intense if you feel it's too much, but just push yourself a little further and see how you react to it. Adapt yourself accordingly. Backtrack algorithm.

**When I feel sleepy, what do i do ?** Well, I put my face in a bucket of water for like 10 seconds everytime i feel sleepy. 2 coffee cups only before 16:00. After that time it disturbs your sleeping system. I sleep around 23:00 -- 23:30 ( already feeling exhausted by this time ), and waking up around 6:30, 7:00. I also make a juice of couples of lemons everyday (with little to no water), as an energy drink only. It gives a sudden electric charge to the body, which makes you feel a boost.

**Too much screen ?** That's why i use physical books and print what I can't buy, to prevent eyes fatigue.

Headache ? I only got a hard headache around day 6, to which i took an aspirin. I was very exhausted by this day which is very natural, hense why i kept it light with SQL and maths only. I'm not a fan of any industrially made products, especially for energy or headaches. I prefer very little to nothing.

**Sitting too much ?** Yeah, that one is inescapable. I work standing sometimes, i sit in others. I prefer sitting in a Zen meditation posture ( which i'm very comfortable doing for hours ), but try out and see what works for you.

**Tools I use ?** I'm on mac, For IDE i use [NOVA](https://nova.app/) and [Notable](https://notable.app/) for note taking only.

1l6p2e7,Google Interview Experience SWE,"It's been 2 months since I joined Google, and I would like to thank the community by sharing my interview experience with Google (SWE New Grad)

  
July 2024: Applied for Google

October 1st 2024: Online Assessment

October 3, 2024: The recruiter reached out to me and mentioned that I need to schedule my interview on or before October 31st. I have scheduled my interview for October 31st.

Preparation: I have solved NC150 which has helped me to prepare for the interviews. But, I need to practice more problems for DP, Trees, and Graph concepts. Hence, I started to refer to the TakeUForward set of problems on YouTube. I have scheduled a mock interview every other day to practice my communication.

  
Round 1: Behavioral interview. Nothing fancy, Just the standard set of behavioral questions you expect in an interview

Round 2: I was asked a DP problem, and I kind of fumbled a bit, just because I was stressed for no reason. The interviewer was friendly. He described the scenario, and I asked some clarification questions. Later, when I asked for a testcase, the interviewer suggested I come up with my own testcase. I explain the approach, and the interviewer gave me the green signal to code the problem. After coding the solution, I had dry run the code with my testcase. The interviewer gave me a different test case, which I had to adjust the solution a bit. Then the interviewer asked me a follow-up question, which I managed to solve in the last minute. After that, we discussed the time complexity and space complexity.

Round 3: Hard backtracking problem. The interviewer was not as friendly as the first one. Initially, I thought it was a math problem and started to think on that ground. But later, the interviewer modified the question a bit, and then I thought it is a backtracking problem. The interviewer suggested I come up with a testcase and the output as well. This helped me to build the logic for the problem. After 20 minutes of discussing and thinking, I started to code the solution. I should have asked more questions on the input format, which would have saved some time. Anyways, I managed to solve the problem in the last minute and messed up the time complexity. 

Round 4: Easy medium hashmap and heaps problem. My favorite interviewer was among all the rounds. Understood the question within 10 minutes and coded the problem in 10 more minutes. We had a verbal discussion of follow-ups, and the interview was done in 30 minutes. I was just asking some questions about some interesting projects that he is working on  at Google

November 11: Got an email from my recruiter that I passed the interviews

For the next 4 months, I was stuck in a team match phase. I was frustrated as I hadn't received any call.

Feb 28, 2025 - March 10 2025: Got 4 TM calls from Boulder. Just some random questions regarding your resume. You can ask about the projects that the team is working on, the ,culture etc. Managers just go with the vibe check. If you think you are interesting, then they will extend the offer.

A first year PhD studentm I started my PhD around March/April 2025, so it's been almost 5 months now. Honestly, I feel like I haven‚Äôt made any real progress. I‚Äôve learned a lot and tried many things, but I haven‚Äôt found any meaningful results yet. Everything I try ends up being‚Ä¶ kind of normal, not worth publishing or moving forward with.

Our PhD project is divided into three main parts. I‚Äôm currently working on the first part, and I‚Äôve been stuck here for months now. My supervisor insists that I need to find a *good* result before moving on to the next stages. I suggested maybe we could settle for a ‚Äúdecent enough‚Äù result and move on just to keep things rolling, but he said no, that ‚Äúthe rest will come after we solve this part.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the tricky part: I‚Äôm working a full-time job (40h/week), which takes up most of my energy and time. It‚Äôs a really good contract, so I don‚Äôt want to give it up, financially and career-wise, it‚Äôs very beneficial. But I also don‚Äôt want to quit my PhD. I genuinely want to make this work.

Because of the job, I barely find time to do proper research. I‚Äôm constantly feeling guilty, stressed, and like I‚Äôm falling behind. My supervisor has been on vacation and hasn‚Äôt responded to any of my messages for almost two months, so I feel very alone and unsure of what to do.

I just wanted to ask, has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice or perspective? I know 5 months isn‚Äôt a long time in the grand scheme of a PhD, but not seeing any real results yet is really draining. 

Please be kind I‚Äôm already mentally exhausted and just trying to figure things out.

1cs2t9x,I'm 20 and feel 100% lost,"I know I'm not the only 20 year old that has no clue what their doing. I'm about to go into my 3rd year of undergrad, and I can't even count how many times I've changed my major. Right now, I'm in a program called Sustainable Systems Management, which is an interdisciplinary program made up of business, environmental science, and engineering courses. The only reason I didn't go for civil engineering was because I barely passed calc I + II and chickened out of calc III. Needless to say, I'm INSANELY regretting my decision, as it's too late to switch. If I could go back in time, I would've gone for civil engineering 100%.

I'm also dealing with some mental health problems. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder this year, and my therapist suspects that I have ADHD. Between this and all of the switching of majors, I have a 2.8 cum GPA (which is lowkey super embarrassing because I graduated with honors in high school). 

I have literally been giving myself anxiety attacks and insomnia over this regret + what my entire future will look like LMAO. If anyone has any good life advice or literally anything to snap me back to reality,  I'd really appreciate it!

EDIT: holy cow, im so overwhelmed by everyone's support. Thank you all so much!

I should start this off with the fact that I sure as hell don't want to drop out, I have adhd that I take meds for and I had all 4 wisdom tooth removed mid semester as well as a week of me not having my Adderall medication due to shortages. For most of september and october I actually had a good schedule going, sleep was consistent, etc. After the procedure recovery and no meds everything got fucked, my sleep schedule was horrible due to me staying up to ungodly hours to do my stats work online with a friend (I eventually caught up, if it's worth anything), and just generally feeling slightly depressed for the first time in a long time. I still got stuff done, but I've been running on fumes and the fact that I'm passing just feels like a miracle. I unintentionally isolated myself because most of my classes were online too, which didn't help my mental health at all, plus I didn't work out much or cope healthily either. Doing shit at the last minute and whole bunch of other dogshit habits have me feeling guilty as hell too, i just wanna breakdown bc it feels like too much.

I do apologize again bc I'm sure this reads like a sob story y'all have seen a million times over, but just... fuck man. I want nothing more than to actually get my life together over break and then not make the same mistakes next semester, actually maybe get some adhd accommodations and not be cocky assuming I'd be fine.

1dgwhai,Should I drop out?,"I just wrapped up my first year of college pursuing a liberal arts degree, and while I managed to finish in the top 3% of my class, I honestly hated every minute of it.

When I first started, I was excited about the broad range of subjects and the promise of a well-rounded education. But as the year went on, I found myself increasingly disinterested and unmotivated. The subjects that were supposed to be engaging felt like a chore, and the only thing keeping me going was the desire to maintain high grades.

\\As I mentioned, I finished in the top 3%. This wasn't due to passion or interest but sheer determination and the fear of failing. I felt no real connection to the courses I was taking. I realized that I was more excited about finishing assignments than actually learning the material. I joined a ton of clubs and activities, but nothing really clicked. I ended up feeling isolated and out of place. In all honesty, I‚Äôm not even sure what I want to do after graduation. The uncertainty is stressing me out, and I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time and money on something that doesn‚Äôt align with my future goals.

I‚Äôm seriously considering dropping out, but I‚Äôm torn because of a few reasons. My family is very supportive, but they have high expectations. I don't want to disappoint them. Every person for three generations has gone to college and me not doing that is not expected or accepted. I am still an adult and can make my own descions but the concern of expectations is a bit more pressing. College is still expensive, and a lot has already been invested in my education.

The other thing I can't not think of is, what if I drop out and regret it later? What if I miss out on opportunities because I didn‚Äôt stick it out?

I‚Äôm looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or knows someone who has. How did you handle it? Did you find an alternative path that was more fulfilling? Should I try switching majors, or even transfer to a different school? Or is taking a gap year to figure things out a viable option?

This is my first time posting here, so please excuse any formatting or grammar issues.

I‚Äôm a first-year PhD student (23 y/o) and recently passed my qualifying exams. I‚Äôve been exploring my research direction for the past 2‚Äì4 months. It does slightly deviate from my master‚Äôs work, I‚Äôve been reading a lot of papers, Having discussion with my advisor, and working on different projects and also  to trying to narrow things down in my research.

But honestly‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm spinning in circles.

I really want to write my first paper and contribute something meaningful ‚Äî but I‚Äôm panicking a bit because I just don‚Äôt know how to move forward.

My advisor is a good person ‚Äî very supportive and laid back, and he gives solid ideas when we talk. But there are moments when I feel like he‚Äôs not totally sure what I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ or ...that I‚Äôm not doing anything good enough(not with the research but my effort maybe). And sometimes, it feels like he‚Äôs way out of my league, and I‚Äôll never be able to reach his level. It‚Äôs intimidating. 

In this loop- with just few months into it ..i am feeling burnout slightly....i love what i am doing....i know i am kinda being clueless is the reason i am feeling this way

1. How to learn ""to learn""?

2How do you approach a research problem? Is it just about reading papers? Are there structured methods or frameworks that helped you?

3. How do you plan your research or stay organized? Any tools or software you recommend? 

4. Also any tools for research papers? I've tried Connected Papers and SciSpace, but I still feel lost sometimes.

1688kfl,Why I quit my PhD,"I felt this was important to post as reading other people‚Äôs stories was one of the things that 100% helped me in my journey to leaving academia. So happy to speak to anyone that is feeling unsure.

As someone from a family in which no one had gone to university, I was sheltered from knowing what a career in academia is really like. I enjoyed my undergraduate and masters degree and found them relatively easy, and it only excelled my passion for research and academia. The only career path I had thought of was becoming a researcher in the environmental biology/conservation sector, and to do that I knew I had to do a PhD. Upon starting my PhD I found it hard, but I knew it would be, considering the change in work and the big change of location. However, starting a PhD was nothing like starting an undergraduate degree and was extremely lonely and isolating, but I kept telling myself it would get better. I am definitely someone that benefits from structure, routine, and support, all of which I found were extremely hard to come-by in a PhD setting and I found it increasingly hard to manage my workload. I often felt pressured to things I did not want to do as to not upset my supervisor and felt I had to do things I was extremely uncomfortable with like presenting in front of large crowds. I did not come from the same academic background as most (as I did not attend Russell group universities) and I felt that this was not accommodated for, I was just expected to catch up, even though I had missed years of study that most people already had lots of knowledge of. 

One of the main problems with my project came when I realised that none of the supervisors that were brought onto my project specialised in what I was doing, and my main supervisor had decided to branch out and do something new, which meant I had to very quickly become the expert in an area I had only started learning about. Due to my supervisor being specialised in other areas, she quickly made my projects become related to stuff that was meant to be side projects, and less like the project I had been promised due to the limited training on the areas I was interested in. My main supervisor very rarely gave me good feedback and I would leave every meeting feeling absolutely destroyed and stupid. It got to the point I would feel extremely anxious every Monday morning for the group lab meeting and consider not going. However, as this was always the only thing I had ever wanted to do, I just kept persevering and telling myself things would get better, even though they didn‚Äôt. I have always been naturally intelligent, but I have never been made to feel as stupid and humiliated as I have during my time doing a PhD. During the time, I slowly fell out of love with wanting to do research and had decided that I didn‚Äôt want to stay in academia after the PhD and would rather work in industry. All I had seen from academia from other students and staff was a life of instability, bad mental health, and extreme competitiveness. Shortly after, I realised that if I don‚Äôt want to stay in academia, that what is the point in me doing a PhD? Especially on top of the fact I am earning only just over minimum wage, have barely any rights, and feel constantly out of place (there is still very much a class issue within academia that is a whole other thing I won‚Äôt go into). I realised that I am not bound to this, and just because I got in does not mean I need to complete it, especially due to the impact on my mental health. I love my work and what I do, but I do think I should sacrifice everything for it.

I spoke to my supervisor saying that I was thinking about leaving and that I was not enjoying my work. She tried to convince me that leaving was not the right thing to do, that if I left no one would want to hire me in a good position without a PhD and shamed working in ‚Äòlow-paying jobs‚Äô like Tesco. This was the nail in the coffin for me, as like I have seen a lot in the past year, these people are not and have never been in anyway relatable to me and I did not want to be surrounded by people that make me uncomfortable , and are classist and rude. After feeling like I was completely alone in this, I read reddit posts from people feeling the exact same way, and other people that left their PhDs to go onto great careers in their subject area. This immediately made me feel so much better and I hadn‚Äôt even considered that other people had gone through this because quitting is such a taboo subject in academia. 

Since deciding to leave, although anxious about my future, I can tell it has had a large positive impact on my mental health. I have been more open to meeting up with friends, going outside more, being able to cook meals again, I have started reading again, I have the energy to watch movies again, and have even started taking up new hobbies. These are all things I didn‚Äôt even realise had slipped away from me until they came back. More importantly than anything I am excited about the possibility of having a normal job and getting to just be me for a while.

I want to reiterate, that this post is in no way to put people off academia, this has only been my experience, and the point of sharing it is to just be honest with others about how academia has felt for me and the impressions it has given. I was definitely under a lot of circumstances that make it worse than the average person doing a PhD, which definitely exaggerates how my experiences were. But I think it is super important for people to stop sacrificing their mental health just to cling on to academia, because it is not worth losing yourself to. I have seen many other students go through the most awful periods of depression and anxiety because of their PhD and I wish that the option of leaving was a more comfortable subject between students and supervisors. I am happy to answer questions about anything, I wish I had also had access to this information at the start.

EDIT: Also feel it‚Äôs important to say, I went through school, undergrad, masters, PhD all with no break and working to fund all of them at the same time except my PhD which was funded. This 100% contributed to burnout and I would recommend taking a break!!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1688kfl/why_i_quit_my_phd/
1dvksbr,I got tenure!!,"I found out late last week that I got tenure. 

It still hasn't quite sunk in yet, but the level of relief I am experiencing is really difficult to put into words. Over the years, my colleagues, mentors, SO, family, and virtually everyone else in my life would continually reassure me that I had nothing to worry about, but I could never bring myself to believe that. It didn't help that there were no concrete criteria/metrics for achieving tenure at my institution - I just kept producing until I no longer could.

Before I got here, many of my tenured colleagues would tell me that nothing changed in their lives post-tenure. Though I know this was well-intended, I remember feeling quite overwhelmed and discouraged that I might be my pre-tenure anxiety-ridden mess for the rest of my career. In case there are any assistant profs lurking here who are wondering if tenure might make a difference, I am still in my early days, but I can promise you that it did for me.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1dvksbr/i_got_tenure/
adix1h,I feel like I was catfished into my PhD,"Hi all,  I'm sorry for this lengthy post, you can find a TL;DR at the end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm now starting my second year of my PhD and I've been struggling a lot to keep up with it. 

&#x200B;

Firstly, during the PhD interview the PI said I'd be doing a lot of computational work, which is my field of expertise, and a little bit of wet lab, which was also ok since I wanted to get some experience in it too. However, since the day I started feels like my supervisor completely forgot my background and didn't provide me the opportunity to learn the necessary lab techniques. When I started writing my project, my first draft was written according to my expectations, with a lot of computational work I thought was meaningful and made sense. On first review, my boss changed the whole thing putting computational work completely aside. I tried to talk to her and she said it was something that would be done alongside wet lab and not to worry about it and so I trusted her. Things started to get worse after that as I have yet to touch a single line of code or software and have been working in the lab nonstop. Having close to no experience in wet lab and the fact that my supervisor gives me no support made things started to go wrong and I see myself stuck in problems I have no idea how to solve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was supposed to continue the work of a previous MSc student who allegedly left things working properly. My boss always said the stuff I was supposed to use was optimised and worked fine, so when I started working on it I wasn't expecting much difficulty to get any type of results. I was wrong, for almost 4 months I was bumping into a huge wall I couldn't overcome, I wasn't able to come up with positive results, which made me think that probably the system my PI thought to be optimised was not after all. This started creating a lot of pressure in me and my work as my PI kept saying it was an issue on my end, due to my lack of experience in wet lab techniques. I asked a few colleagues to test whatever I was doing to see if it was indeed on my end, but turns out they got the exact same results as me and still my boss keeps saying it works, making me test the same things again and again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I feel like I've been learning a lot and I actually enjoy the problem I'm trying to address, however it is getting extremely frustrating trying to prove a point that my boss refuses to accept and is a bottleneck on my work, being put down instantly due to ""not having enough experience"". This, altogether with what I was expecting to do and was promised to do being completely different to what I am actually doing makes me think if I can endure 3 more years of this. I feel my work is not appreciated, despite being improving a lot and working 7 days a week. I've tried to talk to her but she's an ""old school"" PI, becoming very hard to reason with her because she's always right and I'm not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point I feel completely drained and start to think if I should pursue a different PhD. I've started looking for other labs and institutes, but I'm struggling with the fact that I need to submit references for these places too. Although my previous referees are still present in my life to this day and we have a great relationship, I feel bad for going back to them and ask for their help once again. I fear they might judge me wrong and do not understand my current situation. I feel miserable and unhappy, but I don't want to seem ungrateful and that I don't fight for the opportunities given to me. Asking reference letters from my current PI is obviously outside of the picture.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, if I do follow up with the idea to change PhD project, how would I include my current research experience in my CV? Research assistant? I think including stuff like ""PhD Student"" would not benefit me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my PI catfished me into my PhD project and now I feel miserable and I'm thinking to quit and get a new one. However, I don't know how to ask for new reference letters to my previous referees as I am afraid of how they will response to my current situation.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/adix1h/i_feel_like_i_was_catfished_into_my_phd/

znukxf,Relationship in Medical School - Is it worth it?,"I am not a medical student but am looking for some advice on what is reasonable or not while engaged to one (MS-2/3).

I am engaged to a medical student, we've been dating for about 2.5 years, and got engaged over a year ago. We are both really busy and stressed. I work full-time and am in a masters program full-time in the evenings. She is studying around 12-16 hours a day, weekends included, how much of that is studying is questionable, but she puts in a lot of work. I work 8-12 hours a day (during week) and have 2-3 hours per day of schoolwork. But, I feel like I am actively making an effort to spend time with her and I do not get that back. Medical school is the most important thing to her and she says she's studying so hard for 'us' but I feel like our life, and my part in it, is constantly being disregarded to help take care of her. I work with several doctors and medical students at my job and feel like this is extreme.

I moved to a new state to be with her. Bought us a house to live in and I know nobody here. I am taking care of mostly everything for her. I order food when we don't have time. I get groceries. I clean. I take care of the dog. I interact with her family on her behalf. I pay for pretty much everything. I've been planning our wedding. I try to find ways to save her time so that she could spend that with me but it never materializes. She won't even take our dog outside to use the bathroom because she is 'too busy' to take care of that. She will still go out with friends/family and talk to them on the phone for long stretches of time. I don't think I have been truly thanked for doing any of this and is ""expected"" when dating a med student.

I get maybe 5-10 hours a week of time with her for most weeks, that includes things like eating/random chats/shopping/etc. I think some of the things I like to do with her on the weekends (visiting family, going to restaurants, etc) and late evenings (making dinner, cleaning, watching movie) are used to blame me for her not being able to study. She has gotten some low grades, but from what she told me, is still higher than most of her class (and it's pass/fail now so hard to tell). Leading up to big tests recently, she has gone to her mothers to study but now blames me and her mother for some of the low grades that she got.

I have been trying to be patient. We've moved back our wedding date and left it open to avoid things in school. But there have been fights surrounding this and the lack of attention to our relationship and it's kind of spiraling.

Recently, we had a talk and she wants to move out but stay engaged and replan our wedding. I was understanding, knowing that preparing for STEP1/2 is hard, but upset by this. We sat down and talked about expectations. It was to be for 3-12 months but leaning towards 12 months, depending on how she does on testing and what not. She offered up a calculated max time we could spend together to 2 hours per month with a minimum of 0 hours per month during this time and limited texting/calls.

I am being made out to think that I am crazy for not wanting to have this kind of relationship and don't think that will work for us. I just feel like a complete crazy person because I am being told that this is normal and that it is needed for her getting through school. I understand medical school is hard but is it really to this level?

I had about a month between defending and starting my current postdoc, which was partially taken up from the stress of moving.

wgzweb,How do I get through my last sub-I,"Hey y'all. Old story of ""burned out med student,"" etc etc. Currently on my last 4th year sub-I, in a specialty I love at a program I've always really hoped I might end up in for residency, but having so much trouble mustering up the kind of excitement and energy I've brought to all of my other rotations. I'm suddenly dealing with these brutal intrusive thoughts that all of the attendings think I'm a dumbass and are just sort of refusing to give me feedback out of pity. I've always done well in my rotations and have historically gotten a lot of positive feedback in the clinical setting but I'm feeling so out of place and so small and just so damn tired. I also quite like constructive feedback--people being willing to tell you directly what I need to do better at is like the ultimate cheat code to learning--so I'm not just waiting for these attendings to compliment me. They simply won't give me feedback, and I have asked all of them for it in-person only to get shrugs. 

All I want to do is hike, backpack, and do my landscape photography. I've always known that medicine and the outdoors are my two big life pillars. The past two years have practically eliminated my time outside and I feel like half of myself is just being extinguished. At first it was tolerable and I was able to get my fix with online content, activity-specific gym training, and the rare trip when I had some time off, but now when my phone periodically sends me reminder photos of old trips in wild places, I literally start to tear up and have to stop and take a breath so I don't burst into tears. Maybe sounds a bit dramatic to some folks, and that's cool, but maybe some of y'all can relate. I feel trapped, and then when I do have days off I have other responsibilities or things to work on that prevent me from getting outside, so there's just no escape.

I used to be this interesting person who knew interesting things about the world, had a ton of hobbies, was surrounded with good friends, read books like it was drinking water, and was backpacking multiple times every month in incredible, beautiful places. I was strong, happy, passionate, curious, and social. Right now I feel like a dried out watermelon rind left on a sidewalk. 

I do think this is a little depressive episode, and my family and I have discussed the possibility that I have a touch of cyclothymia in the past (also have a brother with bipolar I), though typically my cycles are minor, short, and infrequent enough that medicating isn't worth the trouble or any long-term regimens. Never had a major depressive episode or mania. Once I'm through this month I'm diving into ERAS more seriously, but also moving on to a series of fun electives that give me a lot more time and flexibility--plus will be able to take a few months off entirely during interview season so I can focus on those while doing as much outdoors stuff as I can.

So I really think I just need to get through these next three weeks. I have a couple of hikes lined up soon on days off and am hopeful that will help me get through the month. Curious if anyone has any insight into generating a second wind or finding one last pocket of gas when they're running on fumes, or even mantras you reach for when you need help getting across a finish line?

1lgnmwf,"Good EPAs, Great face-to-face feedback, Failed me for the rotation","I'm exhausted and need to vent. This all happened today so I am still figuring out options and next steps. 

Turns the preceptor of my last rotation failed me. Our evaluations on are a scale of 1-4 for different competencies. Any portion graded as a 1 = automatic fail. The preceptor gave me a 1 on two competencies, a 3 on one competency, and 2's for everything else. There are 14 competencies total. This was a complete blindside. 

I actually loved rotating with them. We had a great rapport. I got along well with staff and patients. I believed my preceptor liked and knew me well enough to ask them for a letter of recommendation and they agreed.

During the last week, they filled out all of the EPAs for me. The EPAs don't count toward my grade but they cover several of the same competencies. I looked at those for the first time today. My preceptor gave me high grades and good comments for each EPA, but scored me poorly for those exact same competencies on my graded evaluation that goes toward my MSPE.

Some of the competencies include: History, Physical, EHR, Communication with Staff, Communication with patients, etc.  The 2 competencies they gave me a 1 for were: Knowledge and Commitment to learning. 

My immediate dean called the hospital and their office to ask about my time there. The staff raved about me. They were extremely complimentary about me to him and said they would love to have me back anytime.

My dean also called my preceptor to see if there was an error or miscommunication. My preceptor affirmed to him that they intended to fail me. I don't know anything additional they said after that.

The whole evaluation was just objectively not true. I don't know why my preceptor turned like this. It all feels malicious.

5 of the 14 evaluation competencies overlap with the individual EPAs where my preceptor scored me highly and left good to very positive comments. Whenever I asked my preceptor directly if I needed to improve anything, they always said ""you are at an appropriate level for where you are in your education. you are doing great."" During long break in-between cases, I was either practicing the skills they showed me how to do or studying on my laptop. I asked a variety of questions regularly. I never had access to their institution's EHR so why not score 'N/A'. Continuing with this point, several of the competencies I did not have the opportunity to do with this preceptor yet they scored me poorly. This preceptor did not allow me really any independence or to provide direct patient care. I was only allowed to take and present 2 patient histories to them over the whole 4 week rotation.

The written comments on the evaluation even contradict the scores given. They wrote ""has a willingness to learn"", but scored me a 1 on commitment to learning. They wrote ""is kind to patients and staff"" and scored me a 2 on communication with patients and staff. They wrote ""needs to work on a more professional tone when delivering content"" and scored me a 3 on professionalism.

I just don't understand. I called one of my classmates who rotated with the same preceptor. They said they had a horrible relationship with their staff, probably was less engaged than me because they hated the rotation, and they have a great evaluation from the same preceptor.

My options are a committee meeting where I have to make my case to a virtual meeting of silent faculty staring at me. The committee decides if I am allowed to repeat the rotation or not.  
Or I can submit a grade appeal and hope for the best. My school has a high threshold for grade appeals though and I do not know how they work for appealing an evaluation.

I just don't want to have a rotation failure on my residency applications that was not true.

1mwa8zi,Why does everyone make a big deal about getting a PhD if it is literally just another thing to do in life?,"Hi everyone, so I‚Äôm coming here with something I‚Äôve been thinking about for months. So I am a second year PhD student in structural and computational biochemistry, I would say I‚Äôm having quite a nice experience, I like my project, I have a very prestigious scholarship, I have a good relationship with my PI‚Ä¶. But sometimes when I talk with other PhD students, or even when I see some posts in here I feel like people make too much of a deal about getting PhD. Let me explain myself:

So while I do think getting a PhD is something great, you know, becoming an expert in an area that you probably love, potentially having professional opportunities because of this‚Ä¶ it is really just another thing you do(?) I feel like sometimes people make their whole personality about being a PhD student and getting a PhD, and stress way too much when in the end is just another thing to do in life. 

Idk in my case, of course I work a lot, I have to come to the lab during some weekends etc, but I honestly do it because I want to, but it is not my entire life. Sometimes I speak with colleagues and all they seem to talk about is their work and how they imagine their thesis defense day, and again‚Ä¶ is just another thing? I felt the same while doing my bachelors and my masters defense, it seemed like everyone was making a big thing out of it and in the end both times I wrote 70% of the thesis in 1 night, got a good grade after the defense and that was it, don‚Äôt see what the big deal is.

Anyone else feels like this? Just felt like sharing this because sometimes I even feel bad about not being more stressed about my PhD. Sometimes I also see people here asking ‚Äúam I good enough for a PhD?‚Äù And I‚Äôm just thinking ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù like why do people even question that?

I‚Äôm so stressed out and despite organizing study groups with classmates I‚Äôm doing poorly.

TLDR: if I get a D I can retake the class and possibly get a B the next time with a different professor (The first grade will be dropped)


Update: commonly asked questions
* Can you drop the class? - No it's too late
* Will the grade be curved? - Not according to the syllabus
* Its just a C! get over it - I can't accept anything lower than a B or it will tank my gpa
* How would getting a D help? - If I get a D I will be allowed to retake the class for a better grade

1jianfv,Are you happy with your job and life as a TT R1 assistant professor,"I'm a TT assistant professor at an R1 private institution in STEM. Very smart and engaged students, my teaching load is low (1:1). I'm still feeling very overwhelmed with the amount of work and high pressure ever since I got a job as an assistant professor. There is so much to do, so little time, and a lot of high pressure to publish, get grants, and get my research program going. I do feel lucky the teaching load is low. I'm also in a midwestern city and my spouse doesn't love living here so I'm wondering if all of this stress is worth it for the cost.

For all of you in a similar position: Are you similarly stressed out or enjoying your jobs? Trying to understand whether my situation is shared.

1k7wn9x,My PI is a robot,"Yesterday, I did a 1-on-1 with my PI. I told him that I'm overwhelmed, and I need some advice just on navigating the PhD. Moreover, I need him to set aside a few minutes for me everyday, or every day he comes to the office; I framed it as a favour he'd do for me.   
  
He straight-up said he doesn't have such time! The only times I can go to him would be to ask a question he can help with; if I just want more ""face time"", he's not willing. The cherry on top was his finisher: if I really cannot deal with it, I should find someone else. 

I'm not really sure if, after 2 years, I can find someone else. I might as well apply to a different program. Yet I'm counting on my salary, and side quests I can run in the city (context: I'm a serious musician). Quitting means I should just go back to my sanctioned futureless country, where neither my past education nor music is going to help. 

I've decided to talk to a counsellor, so that I can persevere; yet I'm not sure if this person would give a solution other than that I should find a change. I also talked about this mess with the postdoc I work with, but my gut feeling says that getting the postdoc on the same track takes an impossible amount of effort.

1i89lc0,Why starting yoga was the best thing I‚Äôve done since starting med school,"TLDR - Try a hot yoga class

‚Äî

This post is gonna be a bit ramble-y but I just wanted to share this story because it has been completely transformative for me and I hope it helps someone else who is in a similar position that I was in

‚Äî

For context, I am a current M2 beginning to study for STEP while also finishing up my school‚Äôs pre-clinical curriculum. I really enjoyed M1. I developed some fantastic friendships, was running 4-5 times per week, and was feeling like I had a great ‚Äúwork-life‚Äù balance. As M2 began, I started to feel VERY overwhelmed with school/research and at the same time there was some tension developing in my friend group that weighed on me a lot. I was able to handle it, but just barely. Then, late fall I got injured and was no longer able to run which was the only form of exercise that I enjoyed. I absolutely despise going to the gym because I am unable to turn off my brain and I just find myself thinking about school.¬†

Fast forward to the holiday break and I had a slew of family health issues arise that took a massive toll on my mental health. Within 2 weeks I went from having a totally healthy family to multiple family members in the hospital and found out that someone very close to me got diagnosed with cancer. While I was still trying to focus on school, it was essentially impossible to have that balance that I used to. I stopped spending time with friends, ruined my sleep schedule by staying up way too late worrying, started severely abusing caffeine to get me through the day, and completely stopped exercising due to my injury. Needless to say, I think I met more than 5 of the SIGECAPS criteria in addition to a significant level of anxiety that I have developed over the past few months.¬†

A couple of weeks ago, a couple of my friends DRAGGED me to a hot yoga class. I was super resistant and feeling really negative about it until I got there. I am pretty out of shape and the idea of yoga was not appealing to me in the slightest, let alone hot yoga.¬†

During that first class, I felt more relaxed than I have been in months. I was actually able to turn off my brain and just focus on that moment. I had never done yoga before, so honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I didn‚Äôt know it would be such a workout. After that class, I had the best day of studying I think I have ever had.¬†

I spoke to the studio about a student discount, and they were more than happy to accommodate what I was able to afford. I have been going every day since. That hour of peace, quiet, and exercise has completely changed my day-to-day life in so many ways. I am now able to be far more efficient while studying. I am feeling less distracted, more awake, less anxious, much happier, and I am sleeping significantly better. Because I have been more efficient studying, I have also been able to spend more time with friends, which has also really improved my mental health.¬†

Moral of the story - let your friends bully you into going to yoga, even if you think you can‚Äôt do it. I cannot express how grateful I am to have found this outlet. Yeah, this might sound dramatic, but honestly, going to these classes every day has been the best decision I have made since starting school.¬†",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1i89lc0/why_starting_yoga_was_the_best_thing_ive_done/

1fzoqdx,I missed a recommendation letter deadline and I feel absolutely awful,"A student asked me for a letter of recommendation for Fulbright, and the deadline closed yesterday. I did write the letter but I was too late, as the system stopped accepting submissions at 5pm, and I tried to submit at 6pm.

For context, I have never missed a recommendation deadline before. I consider myself highly responsible and have a strong reputation as a supportive educator, and I do love my students. But I am also incredibly overwhelmed right now, where I am working 10-14 hour days. I did have the deadline on my radar, but it got buried underneath the crush of everything happening right now. I used to be proud of the fact that I operate at a zero inbox, in that I typically have been able to answer all emails within 48 hours of receiving them, and I am very efficient. But this last three months, I can‚Äôt keep up anymore, because the emails come in faster than I can respond.

I feel just so truly awful. I will do the right thing and tell the student and apologize. I have also already emailed Fulbright to ask if they can take my letter late, but I am doubtful because the website said ‚Äúno exceptions.‚Äù I just feel so upset and angry (at my situation) and I dont know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to fix this situation. I know I saw a post saying someone got into Fulbright even though one of their recommenders didn‚Äôt come through, but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling like I‚Äôve just ruined her future.

Any advice on how to think about this would be appreciated.

EDIT: It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the student in question also happens to work for me as an intern, and she‚Äôs been so good, and I frankly feel like telling her she doesn‚Äôt have to do any more work for me because I‚Äôve messed up, but I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm just so messed up about this.

EDIT 2: I sent the student a full and honest email about my mistake, offering to support in other ways if she needs it. I also offered that she could take a break from working with me for a little if she needs distance. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else I can do at this point, and maybe I just need to cry it out or something to be able to move forward with my day.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fzoqdx/i_missed_a_recommendation_letter_deadline_and_i/
1bifw2i,Partner of a PhD student here - how do/did you maintain work-life balance during your PhD?,"Edit: thank you all for your thoughtful comments & insights, they‚Äôve been valuable in helping me understand work-life balance during a PhD better. I didn‚Äôt expect so many people to share so much with me. I‚Äôll summarise the points made in a separate comment later on ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I (24F) am working a 8-6 corporate job, while my partner (27M) is a computer science PhD student. His advisor is quite harsh towards him - he reminds me of an emotionally unstable parent - and this treatment has worsened as my partner‚Äôs qualifying exam deadline gets closer. My partner barely sleeps from the long working hours and stress, and doesn‚Äôt eat properly or exercise anymore. I‚Äôm so worried. 

I‚Äôve heard that a PhD is incredibly stressful and makes work-life balance incredibly difficult, but I didn‚Äôt imagine it would be this disruptive. I try to support my partner by creating pockets of comfort & time away from work:

- having dinner together every day, whether it be him coming home for a few hours to cook/eat together or me visiting his lab to have take-out together
- encouraging him to sleep normal hours when possible, i.e., no urgent deadlines
- going out together on the weekends, usually grocery shopping or the gym
- listening to him and doing my best to understand his work & stressors. 

Is work-life balance possible, or even important, during your PhD? And if so, what are some things that you or your partner/family/friend did that helped? I want my partner to do his best in his PhD and feel proud of his work, but not at the expense of burnout or depression/anxiety.

Assessments are designed to assess your understanding of a topic. They can be rough around the edges, particularly if you are an undergrad The academic language can be wanting. But first and foremost, *I want your own words*. I want to see your understanding. Write it all down in chicken scratch if you must, and then spend time on refining it. Your own words, *demonstrating that you get it*, are  a pass! They're always a pass. Your own words that you have refined into professional language are getting you into a credit or a distinction.

the money in CS is good but if I only work or hate my job I don't think its worth it, so I've been looking into factory work. not pretty or fun, but its a job and when you go home you don't have to worry about at. the job market is better, not as cutthroat as the CS one.

1kaia0t,Feeling Stuck After Getting Kicked Out of CS Program,"Hey everyone,

I'm a junior Computer Science student who transferred after completing one year at a local community college. I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.

Last fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking‚Äîsomething that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.

As a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I‚Äôm back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can‚Äôt help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don‚Äôt know how to move forward.

I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be. How do I rebuild my confidence and get back on track ?

I received very positive feedback, except for one devastating comment that was among the most brutal I've gotten in 15 years of teaching higher ed. I am trying to acknowledge the positive feedback I received, but of course the negative comment is taking over and causing me to spiral (should I get out of this profession? how can I ever teach again? what can I do differently?). I recognize that the student was a lone voice of dissent, but I also recognize that a lot of what they said is true.

I honored the actual shelf exam with a score in the 90th percentile and I got really good evals on my rotation from the attendings and residents and even the course coordinator told me they were really really good comments.

I was invited to collaborate on a project by one of my university‚Äôs instructors. The project topic is something I‚Äôm very interested in, and I could work it into my dissertation. I‚Äôve been working on this project for roughly 6 weeks now, with weekly meetings between my school‚Äôs instructor and the person with the original concept and data (an adjunct prof from Duke). Now here‚Äôs my problem. They handed me a bunch of code and data and asked me to run a simulation based on several previous studies that used the same equations and model. All great and good. My problem is that these two professors seem to have no idea what is going into this system/model (where numbers originated, what equations were used for what, why certain things were done, etc.), and so when I have questions that arise, they can‚Äôt answer them. I have walked them through a ridiculous amount of information that originates from the documentation they sent me. My questions are what has dominated every single one of our meetings thus far - I email them a question days before a scheduled meeting, they ignore it until we meet face to face, I walk them through where my question is stemming from and why I‚Äôm confused with the next step, and they eventually decide on a solution that could have taken 5 minutes to establish if they had just looked at my question and opened the associated documentation. On top of that, one of these instructors continuously tells me to keep the data ‚Äúas is‚Äù from previous publications of different diseases, rather than putting in the accurate information for the relevant disease we‚Äôre looking at. Which is just bad science and gives research a bad name. I‚Äôve had to tell him ‚Äúno, I won‚Äôt do that, it needs to be updated in order to be valid‚Äù multiple times.

What would it take for you guys to walk away from a publication opportunity? Am I being rash in debating dropping out of the project?

143ebwq,Perspectives and advice from a graduating resident,"As graduation looms and we all move in lockstep to the next stages in our careers, I thought I would provide some perspective as I have been on this subreddit since I started medical school and seen just how much frustration and anguish this path can bring. To the incoming new MS1s - yes it will suck. To the incoming students starting clinical rotations - yes it will suck. And to the incoming interns, yes it will suck.

&nbsp;

But overall? Medical school and residency have been the most rewarding time for personal and professional growth. Sure there were shitty, sleepless, stressful nights where I binged Sketchy trying to cobble a passing grade but I also got to grow alongside the most talented, kind, and hardworking individuals who I may never have met otherwise. My close friends treat cancer, deliver babies, ease the passing of dying patients. The war stories we trade at weddings and graduations are incomprehensible to the average person. We as physicians need to do better in leveraging our collective voice because the community is there - I love all my colleagues and would never want to work with a different group of people.

&nbsp;

I don't feel like I missed out on anything at all - my friends in medical school have gotten married, bought houses, had children, and built their lives from the ground up. They made sacrifices with their time and energy and as a community we do need to prioritize wellness better, especially for starting families. Yes, the tech bro in SF has a nicer apartment - but how can you come home after seeing undocumented patients struggling to cobble together $5 for bus fare then complain about not owning a beautiful home in the suburbs yet? If you ever feel like you got the short end of the stick (maybe you have to take an extra day of call compared to a colleague) just look at the patient in front of you. 9 times out of 10 you would not trade your life for a single day in theirs, and I hope that provides you with some perspective moving forward.

&nbsp;

Coming from a heavily recruited top undergrad, I feel zero insecurity comparing the arc of my career to those who pursued other high income professions. Trust me, the people who question whether they should've done tech are the same ones who go into tech and wonder if they should've gone into medicine or business or law. Take a bunch of neurotic high-achievers and I promise you there will be second-guessers. Be confident and happy in your choice, and know there are avenues downstream to expand your career into other fields. Be proud but not arrogant, and remember that you did not accomplish this by yourself.

&nbsp;

For residency, I recommend prioritizing wellness, happiness, and fit above all else. I chose the program that felt like home. I had some of the most brutal call nights working 48+ hours, patching together the most disastrous eyes while explaining to families that their child would never see again, then showing up to a full day of clinic before passing out for 24 straight hours. It was soul-crushing and I wanted to quit, but it also pushed my limits and taught me that I can do anything I want. Those long nights holding patients' hands are the stories that go into your personal *House of God* that you write every day with your life's work. Those nights are the reason why when I feel overwhelmed, I can tell myself ""Everything will be okay"" and believe it. It's normal to feel stretched thin, but make sure you tell someone. Tell your program director or chief that you need to sleep in. Or just tell a co-resident or empathetic senior. I've sent junior residents home many, many times to catch up on sleep/notes, and that's ok. It's a marathon not a sprint, and we all need help getting to the finish line.

&nbsp; 

And before I make it sound like I had a toxic residency, I should say that I received the best, most supportive training I could've asked for. Don't pick a higher ranked program over one where you'll be happy. In our department of 20+ attendings, we have zero toxic personalities (ok there's one guy who can be snippy but he's also the one who you can call 24/7/365 and will bail you out of any emergency because that's how much he cares about residents). My program director feels like a member of my family. I probably shouldn't even say this but as a senior I had entire weeks working <20 hours. I do zero scutwork - most weeks I was either performing surgery, working in clinics where that I felt were most beneficial to my own education, or seeing my own post-ops. I had all weekends and holidays off unless I'm on call, which we split between our whole class. These programs are less rare than you think (well, outside of surg), you just have to search for them. My family medicine friends don't rush to tell Reddit ""My attending cancelled his clinic today so I'm going home!"" because he's too busy playing 14 straight hours of Diablo 4 (yeah buddy I see you online). Make sure you ask the residents lots of questions on interview day about fit, culture, and training. Speaking to previous graduates may even be more valuable because they'll provide a candid, discrete opinion that should figure heavily into your decision process.

&nbsp;

This is probably the most important piece of advice I will give you: do not, under ANY circumstance, develop a reputation for laziness or unreliability. Pick a healthy residency and work hard, and they will treat you well. If I don't show up for clinic because a junior resident needs me to help them with an emergency, NO ONE will check where I am. I could probably not show up to a single clinic until graduation and my attendings will just assume I'm working with someone else that day. This is because when an attending or resident or program director needs help and I'm able to fill in that gap, my default answer is always yes. If I didn't check an exam finding or review the imaging results myself, I don't lie and say that I did. This is not true for everyone in my department. We have people who have been dishonest in the past or gone missing from clinic one too many times, and they are still being watched like hawks. Your reputation precedes you. I would argue that your reputation is the most important thing to build your career on, whether it be for jobs or fellowships so make sure you protect it. And yes, do try to read a bit when you can to build your fund of knowledge.

&nbsp;

As far as the light at the end of the tunnel goes, I am now interviewing for positions with unbelievable compensation, unbeatable job security, and amazing lifestyle. Again, this is more common than you think. The average attending is VERY happy, they're just too busy golfing to answer surveys about burnout. Human nature is to complain so whenever we congregate we just bitch about how much our lives suck. But the reality is that most patients are endlessly grateful for your work. Remember that patients come to doctors, anxious and fearful, because they want to feel better - it's not necessarily to receive a new medication or undergo a surgery. The human compassion of handholding and counseling is simultaneously the most valuable but least prioritized aspect of what we do every day. This work is intellectually fascinating, rapidly evolving, and will change multiple times throughout our careers.

&nbsp;

So to everyone about to turn over a new leaf, congratulations! Medicine is one big community and we will watch your career with great interest. I would pick this life again every single day of the week. And when you're a 95-year-old GOMER lying in your lakeside villa surrounded by your loving family and the relics of a fulfilling career, I promise your last words won't be ""*I should've gone into business...*""",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/143ebwq/perspectives_and_advice_from_a_graduating_resident/

1miai95,"Good editorial on ""moral injury"" experienced by faculty","[https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/05/higher-ed-morally-injured-opinion](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/05/higher-ed-morally-injured-opinion)

Her language is too saturated in ""feelings-speak"" for me, but it's better than nothing.  Yes, better that we name the problems. Moral injury IS beyond ""just burnout.""   It IS a corrosive, existential injury.   The academy does not itself ""care"" though about our ""wounds"" or pain.  It does not see us as human, mostly, but increasingly, probably expendable with the onrush of AI.

I am planning my early retirement by the day because of different sources of moral injury or distress.  Higher ed  backing us faculty into grade inflation, backing us into smiling blinking and/or ""grey-rocking"" through student misbehavior, backing us into ignoring AI cheating and/OR endlessly playing cop about it is backing us into choosing from bad to worse.  All are against my ethics, professionalism, training, better judgement, morality,  the works.

The forced emotional labor, same.   I know these current shitty conditions of course do not just affect women, but for me as a woman faculty, this is the most anti-woman, anti-feminist era I have ever experienced in the academy.  The encroachment of role-expansion into more emotional labor is misogynist as HELL.    I experience it as a form of profession-wide  but also institutional betrayal. After a doctorate and over 20 years experience I am now to play not faculty, not expert in my field, but mommy, babysitter, customer-service rep, camp counselor, entertainer, trauma-dumping-ground.  It's bad for everyone: faculty, students, and ffs, even future employers of immature college graduates.

These are all roles women historically got STUCK with b/c of no opportunity.  Patriarchy tried to ""naturalize"" and normalize them, but they were/are a result of economic, educational and professional exclusion.    Now, after a world of opportunities opened up (b/c women fought for them) and we took advantage of them, and worked our asses off, we're being essentially stuck back in the kitchen, with the students as our infants and toddlers.

No thanks.   I am pro-choice, and that means forced mothering on the job is unacceptable.  There are women on faculty I know who are starry-eyed into that,  way into the compassion-speak.   If that's where they are genuinely, fine.  But they don't understand that it's a bit they're putting into their mouths that will be VERY hard to get out when they want to re-take the reins of their own teaching.

My mind, my talents, my knowledge, these are what I came into this for.   If I can't use them as much or as well b/c my profession wants me to be a mommy on the job, I'll take my talents and efforts to another set of endeavors.

These past few weeks she has been up practically all night on discord with her friends, which would be all well and fine, if she didn't laugh extremely loudly every 5 minutes. I've asked her to stop numerous times and she flat out ignores me every time. I've also had our RA talk to her to no avail.

I have severe insomnia, so I can't sleep with any sort of noise like that, and I don't have any earplugs or anything and she knows this. I also have bad ADHD, and can't do homework at night because I have absolutely 0 focus without my medication.

I haven't slept in 3 nights bc she has been being so loud and staying up all night. I could barely function today, and I had review for two exams that I fell asleep during bc I was so mentally and physically exhausted. Last week I got 3 hours max every night.

Not only that but l've lowkey been starving myself because I can't eat with her. I have SEVERE misophonia and can't deal with chewing sounds (another thing she knows) and she chews with her mouth open and SO LOUDLY every time.

The worst part of all of this is I've TALKED to her about this and she never understands. She doesn't leave me alone, except when I try to tell her about the problems I have.

I'm so miserable and don't know what to do. I really need to pass my exams to keep up my scholarship, but I have absolutely nothing I can do at night. Any advice is welcome, l'm truly desperate.

Edit: I appreciate everyone trying to help, but I thought I‚Äôd clarify more things.

1. My RA said there‚Äôs not much she can do until after the holidays, which is when the exams are over.
2. I would do homework in a common area, but my laptop only works on Ethernet (it‚Äôs not the best, and I can‚Äôt afford a new one at the moment)
3. It literally has been 3 days. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration. Last night was the first night she slept, and it was at 4am. She doesn‚Äôt have class til the afternoon, and doesn‚Äôt give a shit abt my schedule.
4. The school has been aware of my issues since the beginning, but since I don‚Äôt have severe anxiety, I couldn‚Äôt get a solo room. 
5. The food thing is confusing some people. When I tell you this girl gets so pissed at me if I‚Äôm eating with someone else, or at a different location, and it‚Äôs to the point that my therapist has said it‚Äôs bordering on emotional abuse.

Edit 2: I bought melatonin and earplugs. Melatonin usually doesn‚Äôt work for me, but I‚Äôm desperate. Thank you to everyone who suggested that!

Edit 3: she hasn‚Äôt left our room in a week except to eat (yes that includes her classes, she‚Äôs skipping all of them). I literally can‚Äôt avoid her when it comes to my room, and I‚Äôve had to get alone time in other places. I also did eat today! I went to the town outside of campus and ate more than I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life. I‚Äôm trying to avoid dining halls as much as I can. It truly is an issue, but I think that the finals stress is just making it so much worse.

I appreciate all the advice that you‚Äôre giving me!",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zdskr8/my_roommate_is_about_to_make_me_fail_my_exams/

1dwsq8y,I loathe the digitization of schoolwork,"Currently, all of my schoolwork has a major online component, and it drives me crazy. My textbooks are only available as ebooks (and the ones I can get in print cost upwards of $200). My assignment instructions are listed on an online course page, and the place to create and submit my assignments is on a different page. Then I need to pull up more websites of journal articles for research. So every time I do my schoolwork, I have at least 5 different pages open. Clicking between different pages to find the one I'm looking for is so tedious. Is this the browser with my instructions? No, that's the browser with my submission. Oh there are the instructions. Where is my ebook tab? No, that's the journal article I pulled up. Oh, there's the ebook! And then it's so ahrd for me to navigate through an ebook. Sometimes the next page button takes me to the next ""page"", and sometimes it takes me to a new section. I can't easily leaf through the book to find what I'm looking for. This is a nightmare for my ADHD. I always feel overwhelmed when doing this schoolwork. I feel like I am just not cut out for this. Thank you for reading my dumb rant.

EDIT: I really appreciate all y'all's replies. I feel so seen about this issue haha. And I'm sorry for contributing to the general negativity of this online space. I see a lot of people recommending a second monitor. Due to my ADHD, I need to move around when I do work. I'll spend an hour at the library, then move to my office for an hour, then home, etc. I don't have access to a second monitor, or the ability to set up a second monitor, in most places I do work. I'm glad that works for the folks who have it! Another complaint I just remembered about everything being digital is I can't work outside. I need to have access to an outlet to keep my computer charged. And then usually the sun is so bright that I can't see my screen. I can't even do work when riding in the passenger seat of a car because of how bright the sun is coming through the windshield. It wouldn't be so bad if ebook software would allow me to print sections, but none of the software my courses use allows this :/",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1dwsq8y/i_loathe_the_digitization_of_schoolwork/
f4tvvn,Are we tolerating the status quo too much? [Serious],"In today's medical culture, are we undervaluing physicians by tolerating the status quo?  The status quo of rising medical school costs, poor mental health, mistreatment in residency, broken technologies, inflated administrative costs, etc?...  We limit medical student postgraduate options to internship and residency, yet we graduate NPs and PAs to begin supervised practice with a starting average salary of $105,000.^([1,2](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/nnQn+Rhob))  Meanwhile, medical students graduate  unable to practice medicine without an internship (that pays an average starting salary of $56K.)^([3](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/DW0u)) I'm not arguing against physician extenders or residency. **I'm arguing against the status quo in medicine.** 

To be licensed as a physician in most states, you must complete a year-long internship.^([4](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/GKZv)) California is requiring multiple years of post-graduate training.^([5](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/KWbu))  Our status quo provides no in-between licensure options for medical students, while we are simultaneously graduating NPs and PAs into supervised practice. In 26 states, NPs can practice autonomously in their field immediately.^([6](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/g0nU))  Why are physicians that graduate from a US medical school and cannot match into a residency (for whatever reason) less able to practice medicine than NPs and PAs?  Is it just the status quo? 

Right now, of the medical student graduates who do not go to residency, some become scribes, MAs, and consultants. ^([7](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/1zpK)) Very few find research jobs, and even fewer gain a temporary license that allows them to practice at the level of a mid-level under the supervision of a physician like you can in Missouri.^([8](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/JJ9P))  So what are you, the physician, to do?  The Flexner report of 1910 gave us the gold standard of medical training for the time,^([9](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/qNBL)) yet we act like no future improvements are needed today.^([10](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/6v56)) 

If you're like me, you have some changes in mind.  I can list several improvements I'd like to see.  First, rising school costs are trapping students.^([11,12](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/zFeu+P40u)) Medical school graduates have, on average, $251,600 in debt these days.^([13](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/ggr7)) The debt doesn't disappear, either, for those who cannot match into a residency.  Medical schools are increasing tuition annually and federal loans accrue interest from the beginning.^([14](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/P50Q)) Why do we allow interest to begin accruing so many years before employment is possible, and why do we pay so little?      

Medical schools should aim to produce autonomous physicians, but not every graduate can achieve an internship.  What are they supposed to do? Physicians should create a ""supervision-required"" midlevel-style license for medical school graduates that haven't completed an intern year.  Otherwise, less painful routes to the top of medicine will continue to gain steam. Administrators need to fill gaps in their hospital systems with providers from somewhere, after all.  

We have a physician shortage, despite an increasing number of medical schools and residencies.^([15](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/fgme))^-([16](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/f8ym))  In fact, the total number of residencies available has increased at the same rate as medical school enrollment.^([17](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/FMlm)) However, in 2019 there were still 44,603 students competing for 35,185 PGY-1 spots.^([18](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/u0o7))  You have a huge discrepancy between PCPs and subspecialists, so applicants are unevenly applying to the higher-paying fields.  Also, IMGs are applying for US residency positions. 

Then there is the status quo of mental health crises among trainees and other physicians. Still, physicians and students commit a substantial number of suicides every year.^([19‚Äì23](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/MMMm+XOXG+2G4w+VDdC+9f6k)) That's not a fun fact. Perhaps you're like me and have known someone to take their own life.  Medical training and practice are toxic because of the high stakes.  There are board exams used as gatekeepers to certain competitive specialties.  You are often sleep-deprived and stressed. Not to mention, if you are careless then someone dies (no pressure). Also, healthcare costs are skyrocketing due largely to administrative expansion.^([24](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/bwu3))  Overall, there are fewer and fewer resources for physicians to utilize.^([25](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/HShL)) It's a tough environment right now.  We have to buck the status quo.

**You can** fix the illogical things we are doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing quality. Where to start?  Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses.  It just takes some common sense, optimism, and compromise. It takes all of us.

**Physicians need to get more active in politics.** Policymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement by you, the physicians. For example, we have 1,100+ EHR vendors, in 2020, that cannot communicate data between each other.  That is the status quo.  However, if forced to do it, I argue EHRs could share data.  How?  If policymakers mandated some standard changes to the requirements for all EHRs.  We would need to mandate the creation of a unique identifier that all healthcare providers use to find common patients, a mapping between coding languages, and a system to distribute stored data storage between systems.^([26‚Äì28](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/LV9u+oIpW+20oA))

**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to remember your leadership roles** in the hospital, the community, and beyond to seek progress.  Physicians need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen.  If we can do that, we don't have to worry about anything. The problem is, there are very few physicians with enough of a spine to stand up to the status quo.  Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked.   **You're not alone.**  We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  It's got to be the *physicians*.  


The status quo has got to go.  **How will you stand up to it?**

1g5yoey,Rejected a Master's Offer from Columbia,"In my most recent round of graduate applications, I was accepted to a master's in Ecology at Columbia University. However...they did not provide any funding nor scholarships, which would probably mean around $70-80k in student loans after it's all said and done. I ultimately decided to decline this amazing opportunity, because how could I possibly justify Ivy League-level student loans on top of the high COL in NYC? This field is just not lucrative enough to get those loans paid off in a timely manner, and all of the guidance from my peers had been to only go to graduate school if it is funded in some capacity. However, a year or so after making the decision, I'm stressed that I've missed out on something life-changing. I'm quite simply depressed in my current role in environmental consulting. I really regret the choices that led me here today.

##**Introduction:  About Me & My Journey**

Hello everyone,

I am a data engineer and quasi-software engineer with 4 YOE.  I say quasi-SWE because I'm not that experienced in traditional SWE roles like full-stack, web dev, mobile, etc., but I know enough to be dangerous and am trying to pick it up now.  My main experience is in data engineering using tech stacks like Python, Apache Spark, Data Warehouses like Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks, orchestration tools like Airflow/Dagster, and data modeling frameworks like dbt among other tools.

I've had a lot of career success these past 4 years and have experienced a lot of growth both technically and non-technically.  I spent my first year out of school at an F500 earning 70k/year in NYC, and then during the 2021/2022 hiring boom I made a switch to a fully-remote, boutique consulting firm for 140k/year.  I had other offers in hand, the highest being from a company one step below MANGA for 230k/year TC, fully remote.  I got that offer despite failing two-sum during the technical round as I refused to practice Leetcode on principle.  I am aware that the days of finding opportunities like that via ""spray & pray"" LinkedIn apps are gone, and there's a strong perception that things were ""easy"" back then, and in some ways that's true, but in many ways it's not.

I went to a public, non-target, commuter, liberal arts college.  Zero internships despite submitting hundreds if not thousands of applications each year.  The university career center was useless and had no idea about tech hiring processes.  I didn't even major in CS; I actually minored in it and my major was in linguistics with a focus on natural language processing.  Come graduation, I realized that basically any role in NLP that wasn't data entry requires a Masters at minimum, but much more likely a PhD.  My prospects were really poor, but I had some really good mentors who helped me land on my feet.  My CS skills at graduation were mainly Python scripting, Pandas, some light Java, some SQL, and that kind of stuff.  I was pretty dogshit looking back at it.  I did core CS and math classes like DS & Algos, databases, Calc I and Calc II, linear algebra, and discrete math among others.  I got really good grades, but my experiences showed me that grades are nothing without network, school prestige, soft skills, and company culture fit when trying to get your first role (or any role).

Since then, I've up-skilled a lot.  I got pretty good at building data pipelines, data modeling, devops, developer relations, technical writing, database management, working cross-functionally, and dealing with ambiguity & poor managers.

When I really think about it, my best skills are not my technical skills.  Where I really shine is with my non-technical (aka ""soft"") skills like communication, empathy, collaboration, strategic thinking, and general problem-solving or critical thinking.  When I job-hopped, that's what I indexed on instead of Leetcode, and that's what got me offers instead of being a DS & Algos god.  Many will say ""it was 2021, you were playing on easy mode"", and there's some truth to that, but my counter-evidence is that I've actually quit my consulting job a few months ago, and when I did so, I had a bunch of opportunities lined up in the 150k+ range.  And all of it came from my network.  I decided to chill for a bit and give a crack at independent consulting, and it's been going well so far.

I've also helped two people who graduated this past May optimize their job-hunting processes, and each of them landed a role after 3 months using this process and got way more interviews throughout than before.


##**What I am Offering**

I am offering free, personalized mentorship to 2-4 of individuals who are underemployed, unemployed, or still students but who are struggling to take that next step.  We'd start with one or two 30-minute sessions per week and depending on how things go, over time we can wind that down to once per week, once per month, or as needed.

We would focus on all the things that your campus career center and coursework doesn't teach you.  That is:

1.  Networking.  This is a big one that is a mystery to many (myself included when I was a student).  This will focus on the topic *how to get interviews outside of spamming LinkedIn*

2.  Side projects.  I may not have time to review your code, but I can help assess your skill level & learning style and then guide you towards a project that's realistic, achievable, and impactful for the hiring process.

3.  Identifying your strengths and how to lean into them.  Identifying your weaknesses and developing a plan to bring them up to par.  Identifying your learning style so you know how to get better faster.

4.  Interview Prep.  We will go beyond the basics of *""use the STAR format""* or *""Make sure you can do Leetcode mediums!""*.  I'm working on a framework that leverages all of the above (networking, side projects, knowing your own strengths & weaknesses) + targeted research strategies for the role, company, industry, interviewer to help you position yourself as the **best** candidate for the role.  In other words, we will be discussing **how to sell yourself** even if you do kind of shitty on the Leetcode assessment.

##**FAQ**

### **But if you're not that good of a coder, why are you qualified to give advice?**


I may have a little bit of imposter syndrome myself.  I'm a decent enough coder and I can figure out most things pretty quickly with Google, ChatGPT, documentation, and some reference books.  It's just that the toughest challenges which I've faced these past 4 years were primarily non-technical challenges but rather organizational and management related.  Hence, I got really, really good at solving those problems.

The challenges that I see many of you talking about on this sub in regard to landing a job don't seem inherently technical.  It's not that you're getting interviews and failing technical rounds (though we can talk about that, too), it's that many of you aren't even getting interviews.  Or if you *are* getting interviews and passing technicals, then you're just getting beat by someone else.  That's where I can provide value.

Furthermore, not everyone out there is going to be an elite, programming savant.  And that's okay.  You can still provide a lot of value and be an asset to a company if you complement it with other skills.  I sure as shit am not a savant, and if that's the only kind of person you admire and want advice from, then... well... we probably just won't be a good fit.

### **What's your coaching style?**

I work really well with people who like to push their comfort zone, think outside the box, have a learning mindset, and are adaptive & collaborative.

That is, I may suggest doing something that triggers some social anxiety (like messaging someone or meeting with someone that you don't know that well).  Or maybe we try something experimental or slightly risky, but even if it doesn't succeed, we try to learn something from it and build upon it.  It takes courage, but you gotta push through it.  If you only just want to stay home, talk to nobody, optimize your resume for the 200th time, and spam LinkedIn endlessly, then I won't be that helpful to you.

I focus more on process and outcome rather than output.  For example, you can send out 1,000+ LinkedIn apps (process + output) and get no responses (outcome).  Instead of thinking *""the market is fucked, and there's nothing I can do,""* I work best with people who are open to adopting a mentality more like, *""this clearly isn't working.  Let's keep pushing, but I need to try something different""* (process).  It's like the saying *""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again but expecting different results.""*

### **Why are you doing this?**

I remember how tough it was when I was getting started.  I went to a public, non-target, liberal arts, commuter school with zero sense of how to network or sell myself.  I had hella imposter syndrome and was shy as fuck.  While I enjoyed some aspects of my time at that university, it is basically at the very bottom end in terms of alumni network, career services support, and brand recognition.   I had to push myself and bust my ass to make contacts and figure it out (mostly) all by myself.  If I can help someone get even one step closer to their goal, then I'll feel satisfied.

### **But why for free?**

You guys are either active students shelling out tens of thousands per semester or unemployed/underemployed while struggling to pay back your loans.  I'm extremely blessed in that I don't have loans and have found moderate financial success, and therefore I don't need your money.  And I won't pull some bullshit like ask for a slice of your first paycheck or anything like that if we find success together.

###  **What's in it for you?**

Altruism.  Primarily helping others.  I've considered pivoting into career coaching, and if we work together and you find that my help is really valuable, then maybe that will be enough validation for me to try to monetize my coaching skills in the future.  But for now, that's not the goal.

### **What can you actually help me with in a concrete sense?**

I can't guarantee you a job nor can I guarantee you interviews.  At the end of the day, you are the master of your own future, and I believe that there's often an element of serendipity that cannot be forced.  What I can do is try to help you unblock yourself to put you in a better position to find success.

To put it more concretely, this may look like:

1.  Building up your confidence and helping you push down negative self-talk and imposter syndrome.  This is a big one.  We'd do some introspection and analyze your strengths and weaknesses beyond coding.  There's a lot more to being a productive team member than churning out pull requests.  If you're a weaker coder, then you need to leverage those non-coding skills.  Fortune favors the bold.  There's opportunities out there, but you just need to be more proactive and take some small risks.

2.  Discussing etiquette on how to reach out to cold contacts, request a warm introduction, or run a coffee chat.  Discussing further on how to turn these networking exercises into leads and then hopefully into job opportunities.  The idea is you'll do it with some heavy guidance/hand-holding the first 3-5 times, but you'll get better at it and ""networking"" will not be this abstract, confusing, nepotistic-sounding concept.

3.  Helping you systemize your job search that goes beyond the surface level.  That means doing more than just spam applying on LinkedIn or Indeed.  Spam applying has the lowest probability for success in the current market conditions, and therefore we will focus on higher-probability channels such as building out your network and getting warm intros as well as targeting roles that are *right* for you (fit your goals and you have a real, fighting chance).

4.  Interview prep.  There's a million resources out there on the topic, but the truth is that it really varies from company to company.  We would focus on a more generalized approach where you feel empowered to do all the prep yourself quickly, efficiently, and tailored to each company and interview round.

5.  Discuss side projects, their role in the hiring process, and how to execute something impactful without driving yourself insane or spending months on it.  There's many ways to skin a cat, but even if your skills are severely lacking, there are some side projects you can complete in a single weekend that can help you during an interview.

6.  Lastly, we'd discuss your goals as well as your like & dislikes.


The main idea is every day to get one step closer.  And every week be 7 steps closer.  And every month... you get the idea.  With a proper strategy, things are bound to turn in your favor eventually, despite the current market conditions.  And, frankly, there's no other option than to wait for the Fed to lower interest rates if you just want to spam LinkedIn; however, if you get really good at all that's mentioned above, then you'll be ready to **pounce** when those interest rates are lowered and interview invites are more abundant.

1m8rrfo,Any advice on struggling with focus and perfectionism during PhD,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently doing my PhD and have been struggling with focus and motivation. Whenever I find something useful for my work, my brain immediately thinks, ‚ÄúOkay, time to reward myself with some YouTube or phone scrolling,‚Äù even though I‚Äôve barely made any progress. The habit is frustrating because it disrupts my flow and creates a cycle of distraction.

Sometimes, I also hit a mental block where I just can't seem to move on to the next idea, though deep down I know I haven‚Äôt truly pushed myself yet. This never used to be a problem during my undergraduate studies as I could complete tasks efficiently and stay focused. Now, I feel like I‚Äôm stagnating.

I‚Äôve also noticed I avoid progressing because I feel overwhelmed and overly perfectionistic. I get stuck wanting things to be ‚Äújust right,‚Äù which leads to procrastination.

Is this a common experience among you guys here? If you‚Äôve gone through something similar, how did you manage to overcome it?

1fpge9w,How to start living my life?,"I'm (25f) sure a therapist could better handle this but who has time for that, right guys? haha üò¨
Anyways, I'm the poster child for the whole academic overachiever-to-burnout pipeline and now here I am, well into a PhD and I feel like I still haven't begun to live.

I sacrificed romance, debauchery and sadly, my body for academic achievement my entire life, and now that almost all of my friends and acquaintances are either working or studying in another country, I feel like I've wasted everything. I was too scared to apply to another country for a PhD because I'm very close to my parents, and being away from them just felt wrong when I realised they were getting older. But I'm so stagnant. I'm in my hometown, but mostly at home, because what's the point in exploring the place I've always lived in with my 2 school friends who are still in the city?

I have my various hobbies (if playing Hitman WoA and reading count as hobbies) but my brain keeps postponing things, saying ""you'll do this or that during your postdoc, etc"". It's always AFTER the next thing. I'll get healthy/exercise/live-in-the-moment/find love/experience things AFTER I achieve x/y/z. It's never now.

I AM that loser who peaked in school; who never grew up and now my brain is rotting (I don't even know how to use a semicolon correctly anymore). I'm losing myself to overconsumption because that's all I do now. I do the science in the lab or on the computer and then I feed my brain with movies and shows and books and dreams to escape my mundane reality. I feel like I haven't existed as a person for years. I'm alive and breathing but my mind is lost to the ether.

I just need to know if anyone out there has felt the same as me, and if it ever changed for you. How do I prevent myself from being a sad loser virgin all my life? I know I'm super interesting and fun deep inside but it's buried under a fat layer of ennui. Help pls.

18vwk8i,Struggling with accommodations,"Read my student evaluations, and one of them claimed that they and their peers felt that I didn't respect accommodations. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching as to whether or not that is true, and I think there are a few things I'm struggling with, so any advice could be helpful. 

1. I am teaching a new 4/4 (8 new preps) with ~150 students. About 25 or so have accommodations to different degrees, and I can't always remember who has what. I do have it written in my attendance sheet, but when I'm grading, I don't remember who has late accommodations etc. I am already so overwhelmed and behind that I struggle to keep things straight.


2. My students don't always follow their own accommodations. For example late work at my school requires asking me ahead of time whenever possible and cc'ing the disabilities office. My students almost never do this and just expect to be able to turn things in whenever they want. I don't want to put an undo burden but they also need to follow the procedure.

3. With #2, the accommodations are usually written to imply that students must ask me to use certain accommodations. Students seem to think that they should always get all of them all the time. I'm not sure what to do.

4. I'm seeing some more radical accommodations that I worry are hurting the students. For example, this is the first semester that I've seen students allowed to write fewer pages than required. While I of course allow students to do this, I do express my reservations to them that they will be able to fulfill the prompt in 3 pages instead of 5. I really don't understand this one at all because it's not like I'm assigning arbitrary page amounts. I hate grading writing, so the amount I assign is the amount they need to successfully complete the assignment. 

I've also had students ask to combine two wildly different assignments into one assignment and to not just do entire assignments. I'm willing to work with them to adapt the work, but imo they still need to complete the all of the work.

5. This is the biggest one: my students won't communicate with me. I ask every student with accommodations to meet with me at the beginning of the school year and again when they ask for one of these more radical accommodations. No one ever did. 

I want to help them so much but I also need them to meet the course objectives. I already plan on making an appointment with the disability office when the university reopens, but any other advice here would be greatly welcome.

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the advice and support here. I REALLY care about my students, but I have been insanely overworked this semester. It's really disheartening to get evaluations where students seem to think I don't want to help them, when in reality, I do, but I am so tired.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18vwk8i/struggling_with_accommodations/
um8fmv,Been mostly lurking in the ‚Äúcollege‚Äù subreddit lately and the term ‚Äúmental health‚Äù is used over and over as a reason for failure.,"I understand that people have mental health struggles. I‚Äôve had my own struggles with anxiety and depression throughout my life (and still today) but I keep seeing the same post from countless students that their ‚Äúmental health issues‚Äù are the reason why they failed a class or out of college entirely. 

While this may be related in some way, I feel like (at least some) students use mental health as a scapegoat for their lack of accountability and then are angry when professors don‚Äôt bend to an unethical point to get what they want. 

It‚Äôs so bothersome to me as a person who has never used my own struggles as an excuse ever in my academic career. 

I‚Äôm also growing increasingly concerned about this for two reasons. 

1. Those students with true mental health issues may fall through the cracks as instructors and support staff are overwhelmed with an increased number of students making these claims.
2. In knowing this, it makes me concerned for future conversations that I may have with my own students, where my ability to feel empathetic wanes with so many requests. 

I‚Äôm pretty structured, though I try to be reasonable. I also know I‚Äôm not a psychologist and the appropriate departments are always notified when I feel that a student is at risk. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just venting here, but I feel that this problem will only continue to grow. I should stay off that subreddit.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/um8fmv/been_mostly_lurking_in_the_college_subreddit/

But the fact is that I'm not OK. I made an international move during the pandemic with my family, and it was hard as heck. I'm still not settled a year later and still not OK.

I was not prepared to feel a loss or grief  from moving on from my past adjunct position.

I was not prepared to handle the emotional weight and struggles that our students are facing.

I was not prepared to raise young children during a pandemic in an unfamiliar school system.

I was unprepared to hear so many stories of injustices from students and in the world around us.

I was unprepared to have so many adjuncts facing burnout to the point where I have carried their workload in courses that we share.

I was unprepared to have my anxiety disorder spiral out of control. I've counted at least 14 panic attacks this year alone.

I was unprepared for all of the weight that I've gained during the pandemic and for a ""caring"" faculty member to constantly leave brochures for healthy eating on my desk. (BTW I'm on not skinny but still less under 160 lbs).

So that's my rant. I'm in therapy, I talk to my family about it. But I'm not OK. I thought that I'd share just in case anyone else also isn't ok.

1m9daoj,I successfully defended my PhD thesis and here is my experience,"I had my viva (thesis defence in the UK) yesterday and I passed with minor corrections. I wanted to share some advice on how to prepare for it:

1. I started preparing a week before because I was too stressed to start earlier. But if you can, start earlier. It takes time. The more you prepare, the more confident and relaxed you‚Äôll feel.

2. The most important thing is to know what you did, why you did it that way (theory, methods, everything), and how you did it. Make sure you have clear answers for all of these questions. Saying ‚Äúmy supervisor told me to do it like that‚Äù is not a good answer, you need to be able to explain the reasoning behind every decision you made.

3. When you‚Äôre preparing for the viva, you might feel like you don‚Äôt know anything. That‚Äôs absolutely normal and many people feel that way. I had the worst imposter syndrome in the last few days.

4. Read your thesis pretending you‚Äôre the examiner, and think about what you would ask yourself. Re-read the key papers and also catch up on any recent work in your area so you feel confident discussing both past and current research.

5. Finding mistakes in your thesis and having panic attacks about it is also completely normal. Honestly, my examiners didn‚Äôt even notice the ones I found. Maybe because they‚Äôre focused on understanding your work, not on every little detail.

6. There‚Äôs no way your examiners will know everything better than you. They might know certain areas better, but you know your research better than anyone else. Try to be confident, you did all the work!

7. It‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll ask broad questions and have a general discussion. I literally prepared answers for every possible question they might ask. It‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll all come up, but doing that helped me feel more confident.

8. I prepared lots of notes for my answers, just in case I panicked and forgot everything I knew. I didn‚Äôt use them during the viva, but having them made me feel more comfortable.

9. There are some general questions they‚Äôre likely to ask, like: ‚ÄúIf you were to do this research again, what would you change?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat are the implications of your work?‚Äù Prepare short, clear answers for those.

10. When answering, take your time. If you‚Äôre unsure what they‚Äôre asking, ask for clarification. You can say ‚ÄúI need a moment to think.‚Äù Don‚Äôt rush or ramble, take a second to collect your thoughts before speaking.

11. You might not be the only one feeling nervous. One of my examiners was doing their first viva and was nervous too. My supervisor told me even experienced academics get nervous, they want to understand your work and ask good questions.

12. Lastly, and this might sound mad, try to enjoy it. The viva is a discussion about your thesis. Be curious and open-minded when answering. You can even ask them questions about what they think.

The day before the viva, try to do something fun or relaxing, whatever helps you unwind. I went for a long walk and had a nice bath, and it really helped.

1g3okqk,Missed my mid term,"So the title says it all. I had my midterm on Saturday from 9-11 am but accidently I had written it down as 12-2. This is because all of my mids for this session were from 12-2. However this is no excuse. I realised I messed up when I reached campus and immediately got hit with a wave of panic. I ended up calling my instructor who told me to go to the admin office and get the head of examinations on the phone. Immediately after she told me she would be taking retests for another ill student and that she would do something for me.

Now I know that sounds comforting. Shes a very strict teacher but I sit right at the front and make sure to ask questions, usually ace quizzes and always show up on time. However I recently learned that in order to get approval for a mid term I actually need to submit a formal request through our university online system, and there is no option for being stupid. Only genuine reasons like illnesses, death etc, plus even if it gets accepted it comes with a hefty fine and a 85% grade scale. Im so stressed I cant sleep. This is 25% of my grade, I aim for being a deanlister and getting a shit grade will ruin my chances forever. Any advice? I already emailed her an hour or so ago regarding my queries.

1hda3np,Please help: Don¬¥t know how to communicate an authorship conflict with ex-supervisors,"Hi dear community,

I need your advice on a matter I¬¥m dealing with regarding authorship of a publication from my PhD - it¬¥s a long story but I¬¥ll try to keep it as short as possible. I feel like I¬¥ve been wronged and I¬¥m surprised at how difficult I¬¥m finding it to speak up for myself so I need your guidance to see if my perspective is too harsh, too soft, or in the goldilocks zone of conflict mediation. I graduated from my PhD (marine biology - country is Ireland) last year and had a pretty tough time during it, especially with imposter syndrome. I¬¥ve now moved onto a great job in a great institute in Portugal with a slightly different speciality but still marine science and am enjoying employed life in academia, however, this incident is throwing up a lot of old feelings and I don¬¥t have the colleagues to turn to for support.

Here¬¥s a breakdown of what happened:

\- The final chapter of my PhD is a paper based on two years of field trial experiments I conducted with the supervision of my three supervisors and co-authors. We submitted the paper to a journal when I was graduating and it came back with major revisions (some grammatical stuff, some statistical reanalysis). I was first author because I did all the work, analysis, and writing, there was never a question about authorship. We decided not to resubmit straight away as I was busy graduating and seeking employment.

\- A year later and my more immediate supervisor wrote to me to ask about resubmission to another journal. I agreed but was very busy so admitted I was happy to do the minor edits but didn¬¥t have the time to do a full re-analysis of the stats but suggested sharing the workload to which they agreed (two supervisors in the email, the one directly above me and the more ""auxillary"" guy, they excluded the PI from the conversation who is very high up in the university and heads the whole STEM dept.

\- I shared the manuscript with them, clearly stating that I was happy to continue working on it together and had made time to revise in the coming weeks after their revisions. Two months later I receive an email from her with the all authors in CC celebrating that it has been submitted to another journal and is now in pre-print. I view it to find out that I was removed as first author, the statistical revisions were never made, and only grammatical changes were done. I was never given the chance to approve before resubmission.

I am pissed about this but have been so conflict avoidant that I haven¬¥t said anything but now it is bothering me too much and I need to address it. Eventually I got around to drafting this email but would love some outside perspective on how this might come across?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear X,Y, and Z,

Greetings, I hope this email finds you well.

I was quite shocked to receive your email informing me that you had submitted the field trials paper and it has taken me some time to process this and figure out the appropriate response. I would like to give you the opportunity to share your perspective on the matter and I have a few questions to which I would appreciate your honesty. Hopefully we can find identify a cooperative and productive next step.

The primary questions I have at this time are:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† At the time of submission, did you indicate to the journal that all authors had reviewed the final draft and given permission for the manuscript to be submitted?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Was there a unanimous decision reached by all co-authors to not allow me the opportunity to review the paper before it was submitted?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Can you please outline the decision process behind removing me as primary author and how the changes to the manuscript are reflected in the updated CRediT statement submitted with the manuscript?¬†¬†

Below is my perspective on the conversation we shared over email in May of this year which I have spent time re-examining. If you have interpreted the conversation differently, please share your perspective on the same.

When we last spoke about re-submitting the paper, I made it clear that I was happy to continue working on it together, and would make the grammatical and bibliographic changes recommended by the original reviewers. I informed you that I did not have the time at that moment to re-do the statistical analyses suggested but was happy to consider alternative journals which we could submit to. When I shared with you my version of the manuscript, I said I was open to discussing the reviewer comments and indicated that I had scheduled time over the summer to revise after you had made your revisions. At no point did we discuss a change in authorship, and at no point did we discuss submitting the paper in the state it currently exists. I indicated I was looking forward to re-submitting and had been researching journal options. The next email I received from you was when you told me the it had been resubmitted to ""Journal B"" and is under pre-print.

As I see it, this paper reports on the experiments which I conducted over two years of my PhD. With your guidance and supervision, I conducted the field trials which entailed the following: researching and collating the literature, designing the structures used for applying different treatments, collecting specimens in various locations around ""the country"", liaising with the producers, relaying and securing them on the study site, selecting materials, testing, and building the  frames, carrying out the field- and lab-based sampling at every sampling period over the two summers, carried out the dissections, and the molecular analysis, histopathology, and other lab work. I curated and analysed the environmental data, carried out all of the formal analysis, produced all of the graphical elements and of course wrote the original draft and subsequent editions following your helpful revisions and comments. Clearly this was an effort worthy of primary author when we initially submitted the manuscript to ""Journal A"" as per the agreed upon author contributions copied below.

The changes to the manuscript submitted to ""Journal B"" include: grammatical adjustments in a number of sentences, five new sentences added to the methodology section, three new sentences to the discussion, some minor bibliographic changes, and the map pinpointing the study site was slightly adjusted. The statistical reanalyses were not completed and many of the issues highlighted by the original reviewers were not addressed. I hope you can understand my concerns around these changes and my confusion as to how they are reflected in the new author contributions.

I would like to make it very clear here that I do not in any form whatsoever undervalue or underappreciate your supervision, guidance, advice, and assistance throughout these experiments, and your expertise played a vital role in producing a worthy piece of research, in particular for the conceptualization, experiment design, reviewing and editing, and funding acquisition. I have always been and still am very grateful for the support and training I received while conducting my PhD research.

If it is the case that you all believed my contributions to this research are not worthy of primary author, this is a conversation you should have had with me. The problem arose when you made the decision not to discuss the change of authorship with me, not discuss the revisions to the manuscript, and not allow me an opportunity to review before submission or to resubmit. We are all members of the scientific community and abide by common codes of research ethics and academic integrity. Both ""University"" and the  ""Journal B"" have specific policies and guidelines around authorship handling and the types of practices which are considered misconduct.

It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this situation and I sincerely hope we can come to some resolution. I wanted to first express my concerns and share my questions above, and offer you the opportunity to share your side of the story before bringing it any further. It would be great if we can discuss our options and find an amicable way forward.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I¬¥m sorry for such a long post, and I don¬¥t expect you to read it all but just trying to give the full information.

What would you do in this situation? Is the drafted letter/email way too long and overthought? Am I within appropriate response territory or blowing it out of proportion?

FWIW, I would assume the PI and maybe even the auxillary co-author were not aware of the submitting supervisors actions, I feel like she may have ""believed"" or told them I was no longer interested in submitting and took it over. I know I may be lighting a fire by mentioning misconduct but it annoys me greatly that there is a paper in pre-print which I worked my ass off for two years on and did literally all of the groundwork (with their supervision and revisions etc) which now has her name as primary author, especially when it is already published as the final chapter of my phd with me as first author and there was no doubt about me being first author on the first submission.

Please help my overthinking, anxious, imposter-syndrome riddled mind!

But in this 2 months, I got burned out and hit existential crisis and even thought of dropping out of my Ph , (thanks to my PIü•≤).

1cwrbyq,Anyone leave their PhD late in the game?,"country: US 

I am at end of year 4 our of 5 in my STEM PhD program. I am deciding whether staying is worth it. This is my list below summarizing some key facts: 

1. I no longer want to be in academia. I went straight from undergrad to grad school. My only ""work"" experience is in my PhD

2. I don't want to regret the last 4 years, plus get no recognition for the sacrifice of the PhD (the program only allows you to receive a masters if you complete the PhD). The masters program that would not require defending a masters thesis requires classes that PhD students wouldn't commonly take. 

3. The relationship with my PhD is driving my to burnout. She doesnt have time to be involved with projects (typical of PhD) but wants to micromanage. This results in  responses in what could be categorized as abusive to issues she creates (eg refuses to read early stage documents but says she agrees etc.). The biggest issues is that with all people in my lab she has had this cyclical issue of exploding and crossing boundaries that we previously set up for better working relationships. Then she apologizes and comes up with new ""working policies"" that only last until she is stressed again. 

4. At this point I am having physiological responses to working on my project. Feeling nauseous when going to work. I get shaky when i get a Microsoft teams message in fear of what shes going to say. I feel I definitely am experiencing burnout - fatigue, feeling unable to do normal activities (eg social time, cooking, eating etc).

My concerns:

1. My PI is my only letter of rec. post undergrad and now I am 4 years our of undergrad. If I applied for jobs now in something like data analyst etc. - would this be risky if she is upset that I leave

2. Financially a leave of absence would be difficult. I am not living with a partner or someone who  could cover rent + expenses. Having only made a PhD salary my savings couldn't withstand a full leave of absence. I am uncertain whether taking a leave of absence just to work all the time doing something like instacart would allow me to recover. 

3. Losing 4 years of work - there would be no degree that I would obtain from this experience

4. Job opportunities - is there an increased difficulty to obtain a job with what looks like a 4 year work gap but was a pHD.

Any experiences or thoughts welcome - thanks!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1cwrbyq/anyone_leave_their_phd_late_in_the_game/

I certainly wasn't the best applicant in terms of Step 2, grades, and research, but my advisors thought I'd be okay, and I applied mostly to places where my stats were compatible, lots of community programs. 

I ended up doing 20 interviews and I genuinely thought my chances were good to match to a categorical position. On the interview trail, I was frequently complimented on my personal statement, LORs, and experiences. I prepped a lot for interviews and I think they went well, so I feel like the issue was my stats.

9c7ey4,I think I chose the wrong major and now I'm stuck in it,"Hey guys. I've just begun my third year in Nursing. I always liked the idea of Nursing because I always thought of it as something I could probably do and enjoy because I'd feel like it's a meaningful career. I was actually supposed to start my third year last year, but dropped because of depression. I'm feeling better now and thought I was ready to take school on again and managed to get accepted into the competitive program a second time. 

It's only been 2 week and I'm already extremely overwhelmed. I have to study every single day for hours and it just isn't humanly possible to 100% understand all the info and store it in the very very limited around of time they give us to do it. I feel like I have no life and 1000 worries. I'm sitting down most the day and by the 6th hour I'm burnt out and running on fumes. At that point I have to stop because then whatever I'm reading/writing isn't being absorbed at all so I just end up getting more tired for no reason. The professor's expectations are unrealistic and they all expect us to study hours every day for their classes, and the lab professors expect us to come often every week on our off time to practice skills. In what time is this possible? I take my time to study because I want to actually understand what I'm reading, but that doesn't work because it takes too much time I don't have for the rest of the assigned readings.

I am pretty good at time management, but this is insane and has already exhausted me. It occurred to me the perhaps somebody who truly wanted this career badly would be able to push through. I managed to do so the first 2 weeks but now as I eye the workload for the upcoming third week along with the 2 tests I have to somehow make time to study for the 4th week, I feel doubtful. I've realized that maybe I don't really want this. Maybe I liked the idea of it but not the actual practice.

I have no idea what else I would want to do, to be honest. The only thing that comes to mind is elementary school teacher, but I'm not even sure of that. It makes me sad to realize that I never really felt passionate about anything. But even if I knew what I wanted to do, I wouldn't be able to back out of these classes because it's too late to drop without financial liability. I can't afford to pay it. I've already made my poor parents pay too much just to get into this program and I'm not asking for more. 

I feel like I'm stuck in this intense program that I'm not sure I even like because of money. Then if I attempt to push through there's always the risk of me failing especially now that I've realized I might not want this, my motivation will be very low. Ugh I don't know what to do.

196m0xy,Does anyone else feel like this or am I just completely on my own?,"I don't know anything.

I spent 5 years in medical school, I spent nearly a year working. I am reading facts and I am learning facts. I don't know what I did 5 years of medical school.

I was never a terrible student, I was never the best one either. Never failed a major exam, but always just seemed to scrape by in the last few months. I never killed anyone, never gave someone a treatment that I didn't know for sure wouldn't work. I don't understand what concepts are, or what to do with them, what does my brain do with information it learns? 

Sometimes I don't think I have a brain that works, or if I am even here. People seem to be able to relate stuff to each other, and understand how something works. But to me everything just seems like facts floating in space. I can never relate things to anything else.

Am I broken? Is my brain broken? Did I make a mistake picking out a career when I can't seem to understand why something works, just that it does? Have I made a terrible mistake?

A teacher once in school said you had to fake it till you made it, and now med school is over and I'm in real life and I feel like i am still faking it. 

Someone recently asked me how acetaminophen works and I just didn't understand what to say. The facts float in front of me, and I don't know what to say for the fear of fucking up. How can you not know this? A first year med student would know this! 

Why do we give calcium as a supplement?

I am baffled at how little I understand anything at all. Did I have a learning disability that I never understood I had? I was always a normal student at school, did well up to middle school. I remember struggling in physics and some parts of o-chem. I suffer from anxiety and was recently diagnosed to be suffering from moderately severe depression brought on by work. 

But even if it isn't because of my current mental health crises, how do I explain that I struggled in high school concepts of physics as a student? I managed to rote my way thru school and med school? Did i really do that?

I've been clueless since day 1 of medical school and now I sit in the cold stunned fear that I am truly, truly stupid. I imposted my way to this point and when put on the spot and given the time to answer, i truly won't know what to say.

I am truly struggling. Am I the only one who managed to rote memorise their way out of med school?

xlmrrk,Student was in fact three different guys.,"This happened during the pandemic, I was too overwhelmed to even think about posting it here, but it came back to my mind recently and I think you‚Äôll enjoy that one...

We were half-online/ half in-person when it happened. I‚Äôm very good with names and faces, but at that time, it was all a blur mainly because I did not see them as often as prepandemic and also because of masks and turned-off webcams. 

There was this one student who would always ¬´ forget ¬ª his identity card for the exams. It‚Äôs suspicious because where I am, ~~it‚Äôs illegal to go out without one form of identification~~ (Someone pointed out this is not correct, but anyhow, students are expected to show proof of identity with their exam). He had no college card, no drivers license, nothing to confirm that his name and face were belonging to the same human. 

Then I realized that the person I saw the day of exam 1 did not look at all like the profile picture in my files. I thought: puberty hit extra
hard on this one...Still...something felt off.

Exam number 2 comes by and he does not have his card (again!). I explain that no grade will be issued until he is able to prove he is the one registered for the course.

Later that day, I remember that I have recorded video of him (it was for an assignment) and another audio file from another homework. Well, on both recordings, the voice is different, with speech patterns that are undeniably belonging to two different persons...that are clearly nothing alike the guy who shows up for the exams.

I contact the appropriate admins and send them what I got. One of them just replied 
¬´ What the fuck, are you sure? ¬ª

They tried to call, email and meet with the student but he ghosted everyone.

re7dsp,A Guide to Surgery: How to survive (and enjoy!) your most feared rotation,"I had my surgery shelf this week; naturally, I decided to write this post instead of actually studying the night before. This advice may not work for everyone, but it's based off of my experiences (and the experiences of others!), and I think it can serve others well. I also think much of it applies to all the rotations in general, not just surgery, and a lot of it is based off of advice I've gotten from other people, but I've also thrown in a good bit of new stuff as well. If people like this I may also write others for other rotations in the future as well. I will withhold shelf advice for now as I have no idea how I did yet.

**A little about me:** I attend a Top 25 medical school and did my surgery rotation at a large academic hospital that sees a very high daily volume of specialized surgical cases. I'm someone who's struggled with third year from a time-management perspective as a I have a lot of super random hobbies and having to kick those to the side for the year has been quite difficult for me.

There are four sections to this. I know this is super long, so read the pieces you feel will be most helpful.  
**Personality Hacks: how to win people over**  
**Pimping Hacks: how to survive the barrage of questions in the OR**  
**General Hacks: how to survive rounds, presenting**  
**OR Hacks: ""situational awareness"", foley placement, suturing, etc.**

# Personality Hacks

**1. Be confident and friendly.**

This seems obvious, right? Everybody told me this going in, but nobody told me how much it is easier said than done. When you show up and most people ignore you, or they're too busy to pay attention to you, it can be pretty daunting and it's much easier to stand in the corner and not talk. This is not always a bad thing; it's good to know when to keep your mouth shut, so obviously use your best judgement (i.e. if your team is running to a code, probably don't ask people if they've seen the newest Marvel movie). However, you will find that most medical students don't attempt to actually be-friend their residents or attendings, especially on surgery; you will find if you can get people to tell you about themselves, **even if they're not initially blatantly nice to you,** that they will eventually warm up to you. Many of the residents are over-worked and very stressed and/or may have had poor experiences with other medical students; don't take it personally if you can't win somebody over. In my experience, though, if you can get someone to tell you **why** they're stressed, they will often become much nicer to you as they no longer include you in the list of things that is adding stress to their lives. This is especially true if you can make them laugh/talk with you about their hobbies, etc. In my case, my intern was a subspecialty resident who had to be on general surgery for a few months and missed being with her fellow interns. Obviously, you still won't always win everyone over but just take it in stride and move on.

If the attending or the residents in the OR clearly likes to talk about movies, sports, the news, etc, **participate in the conversation** (again, as long as the patient isn't actively bleeding or something). Truthfully, your final evaluations will reflect how much people like you and how much **effort** you put into the rotation, **not** how much you know (more on this later). This seems **so** simple but again it can be very daunting especially if no one ever addresses you directly. Attending pimping you too much? Ask them about themselves. Where they trained, their favorite cases, if they have a family, etc; people love to talk about themselves. Use this to your advantage.

**2. Be nice. To EVERYONE.**

Another seemingly obvious one. **Introduce yourself to everyone, especially in the OR**. This was really difficult for me at first; people in the OR are constantly moving and doing their own thing and I was afraid to get yelled at

The truth is that people also talk about the medical students amongst themselves. Like, a lot. **But this can be a good thing**. I had a resident I didn't even work with text me to tell me that the other residents were talking about me because they were so impressed with how friendly and helpful I was. I promise, the residents don't care about how smart you are; 9/10 times they care more about if you help them and if you can be friendly enough to make their lives slightly less miserable.

**Pro-tip**: If you can befriend the scrub nurses, you win the game. Seriously. If residents and attendings notice that they're joking with / being nice to you, they will automatically do the same. We naturally like new people that those we trust are nice to / friendly with. **An easy way to do this:** Help tie up the gowns of the scrub nurses (though maybe wait until a week or so into the rotation when you are more comfortable with the sterile field). They will **love** you; it shows that you're friendly, that you're helpful, that you can anticipate what needs to be done without getting in the way, and they will immediately respect you going forward. There was only 1 scrub nurse throughout my combined 10 weeks on in-patient OB/surgery for whom I was not able to befriend this way. And remember and use their names, even if you're only with them for the day! They're people too and they'll appreciate it.

**3. Be as helpful and learn as much as you can, even if you have no interest in surgery.**

**If you have no interest in going into a surgical subspecialty**, at least feign interest so that people feel like you're invested. And you never know - something you learn might help you in the future; you'll have a better idea of when to consult surgery, what medical management you can help out with on surgical patients when you're consulted in the future, etc. Also - put in extra work the first week and people will usually push you to take breaks, go home, etc. during the following weeks after they see that you're committed.

**If you are interested in going into surgery, ask** to help out / do things. The worst people can do is say no. Pulling out drains, central lines, suturing, even using the electrocautery knife / blade; many times if you ask, people will let you do at least part of it. After a few days of cutting suture and retracting with the same attending, I had the chance to do a super small procedure almost entirely by myself - opening an infected wound, cutting out the abscess and washing it out. It was awesome and I don't think I would've gotten the opportunity to do it unless I'd asked.

**Good:**

*""Anything else I can help out with?""* This is good for showing you want to be involved but also good for the end of the day. Most of the time people are just busy and will forget to dismiss you so this is when they'll tell you to go home. And if they tell you to leave, **LEAVE**. The only exception to this is if you're mid-case and/or there's another case and you're actually interested in seeing/helping out with the case.

**Better:**

*""What else can I help you out with?""* This demonstrates that you're aware that there's always more you can help out with and doesn't make it sound like you're just asking to go home. Many times people will dismiss you anyway, but at least personally I found this got me better results.

**BEST:**

*""Just came out of case Z and noticed that it's been \~4 hours since case Y. I can go do the post-op check super quickly and let you know if there are any issues.""*  
*""I know we were planning to pull patient X's drain today - if somebody hasn't done it I have a minute between cases and I can go pull it out now.""*

This is by far the best way to impress people. Obviously, you will realize as you go what you're capable of doing / what needs to be done (most on this later when I talk about situational awareness), but in general offering specific ways to help people is what's going to make them write that you perform at the level of an M4 or PGY-1 rather than an M3, especially if you're doing your rotation towards the beginning of the year.

# Pimping Hacks

Before we get started with these: **your final evaluations will not be reflective of how much you know, unless you're some crazy genius.** Many of your preceptors and residents have worked with 10s-100s of medical students (literally), and in most cases, you will impress them by being helpful and kind, not by flexing your anatomy knowledge (though this can help). I had people write things in my evaluations things like ""smartest medical student I've ever worked with,"" ""more knowledgeable than most PGY-1s,"" and ""did not miss a single question in the OR,"" despite all of these clearly being false. They liked me, they wanted to help me out, so they gave me good evals. This is true on all rotations as well, not just surgery.

**Prepare for the cases you're assigned to the night before.**

I know this is not always possible; sometimes you're busy studying for shelves or sometimes you don't know what cases you're assigned to in advance. If the latter is the case, try to ask the senior resident if you can actually be assigned to the schedule of cases; you will seem invested in your learning \*and\* it will give you the opportunity to prepare.

**Ok, but how do I prepare?** Going into my surgery rotation, most people told me ""oh review the anatomy/find a textbook that walks you through the procedure/read Pestana's/Surgical Recall."" All of this is great, but what I found extremely helpful was simply finding a Youtube video of the procedure and watching it the night before. Most of the time the videos are pretty short, focus on the key parts of the procedure, **and** will label / talk through the pertinent anatomy. It makes it **much** easier when you're actually in the OR as you've literally seen it before and will have a sense for what you're actually supposed to be looking for. I've found that most people **do not** do this and you will really impress people and can make them think you are much smarter than you actually are. This is especially true if you've never been in the OR because you will almost certainly have no idea what you're looking at the first time you see inside a living person, **even** if you know the theoretical anatomy really well.

**Ask questions, but make sure you have a solid understanding of the basics surrounding that question.**

What do I mean by this? An example: for a specific type of abdominal wall repair, a certain ligament is typically cut. I asked a question about the implications of this as it relates to prolapse because I was curious. Some attendings will just answer it and move on, but some of them will also ask you related questions that they think are at your level of knowledge: in my case, I was asked to identify the ligament and if I knew what nerve typically ran alongside the ligament. I had worked with that attending before so I had to come realize he would often ask me these related questions and I was ready for it. Knowing the answers made me seem invested but also prepared. Work smarter, not harder!

Another thing to remember is that **people often start with the obvious and move to the obscure**. The first time somebody asked me a question in the OR they pointed to the diaphragm and I thought they were asking me to name an artery/nerve under it and I looked like a total idiot when all they expected me to say was literally ""diaphragm."" This may not always be true (some attendings like to ask really obscure questions, who knows why), but in most cases it will be.

Finally, recognize that the point of pimping is to push the boundaries of your knowledge. Yes, it's annoying when somebody asks you questions until you get it wrong, but this way of asking questions is literally designed to show you what you know and what you don't. Take it in stride, maintain a good attitude, and continue to be friendly. People will appreciate and remember it (especially the other people in the OR who are watching you).

# General Hacks

**What to expect: rounding**

You will likely be asked to pre-round and present 1-3 patients each morning. Yes, you will likely be the only one presenting in the morning. Yes, it can feel annoying / unfair but it will help you get used to what you need to know / think about it as you progress and get more used to the rotation. Surgery rounds are fast, much faster than medicine rounds, so also don't get offended if people rush you, cut you off, or vocalize that you're taking too long.

Most seniors will start you off with 1 patient and then push you to cover more as the rotation goes on. I think most people will do this anyway, but if not try and make sure that the people you round on are the people whose procedures you were actually a part of - it's neat to watch their recovery process and also makes pre-rounding a little easier because you'll already have some idea of their history and what they're in the hospital for.

Some people may make you write notes, some may not. Some may make you write them and still not use them. Again, just take it in stride - it's part of the learning process and if you get good enough they will likely begin to use your notes: this is especially true on the weekend or on nights when there are fewer people covering each service.

**How to present: rounding**

Some of the following might be institution-specific but most of it should still hold true across the board - I'd suggest using it as a framework and then tweaking as appropriate for the hospital you're at and the people you work with. This will also seem like a lot at first (especially if surgery is one of your earlier in-patient rotations), but you will eventually be able to convey all of the relevant information in 60-90 seconds.

**First**: Introduce yourself and check with the nurses in the morning if anything happened with the patient overnight. Look in the chart + see if anyone wrote any notes detailing subsequent events if so.  
**Second:** Gather all your data (see below for specifics).  
**Third:** Go see the patient.

For the presentation:

**- ID Statement:** *""This is a 35 y/o f with a past medical hx of hypertension and a-fib who is post-op day 2 from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.""*

**- Overnight events**: *""No acute overnight events.""*

**- Subjective:** *""Patient is doing well, no nausea/vomiting/shortness of breath, pain well tolerated on analgesics, tolerating sips of clear liquids, not yet passing gas or having BMs.""*  
These are the main things you want to ask the patients about post-operatively (not comprehensive): fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, tolerating fluids, passing gas / having bowel movements, etc.

**- Vitals:** *""Patient is a febrile, they had one episode of tachycardia to the mid-100s overnight, normotensive, oxygen saturation is 95-100% on room air.""*  
Some people are okay with ""vitals were stable overnight."" Some people will tell you that that means nothing to them (especially if you're an M3, since our clinical judgement is still somewhat questionable), and they need numbers for everything. In general, a good rule of thumb is to write down ranges in the last 24h for everything (temperature, bpm, BP, O2 sat / if they're on oxygen at all) - as people grow to trust you they may be okay with you saying ""vitals normal/stable.""

**- Ins/Outs (I/O):** *""In the last 24h patient had 250cc of oral intake, 1000cc normal saline IV. They put out 800cc of clear yellow urine from the foley and the right upper quadrant JP drain put out 20cc of serosanguinous fluid.""*  
On surgery especially, I/Os are very important as they give you a good sense for how quickly the patient is recovering (and you want to make sure they don't have an AKI or acute urinary retention, etc!). If something isn't recorded, ask the nurse **before** you round so you have the most up-to-date info before everyone else.

**- Labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, Ph):** *""Hemoglobin is stable at 10 this morning, patient has a mild leukocytosis which is down-trending, sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphate all within reference ranges. Kidney function (BUN, creatinine) at baseline for the patient.""*  
As an M3, the hardest thing for me initially to remember was that **people care more about trends than the actual numbers**. For example, a Hgb of 8 is technically outside the normal range, but if somebody's hemoglobin is consistently 8 during prior hospital admissions, that's probably their baseline and is not worth bringing up to troubleshoot. Or, for example - someone's Cr might be 2.5, and this is out of the normal range as well. However, if you look back into the past few days, you'll notice that their Cr immediately post-op was 4.0 because they had an AKI, and a 2.5 is actually a good thing as their kidney function is improving. There are a lot of different example I can give, and this is something you pick up over time, but something to keep in mind as much as you can.

**- Imaging:** *""CXRAY last night shows mild bilateral atelectasis at the base of the lungs.""*  
For the most part, look at the radiologist's reading for the XRAY if you're short on time. You should always try to look at the image yourself as well, though, so you know what you're talking about and can read images in the future if you need to if radiology is busy and it takes them some time to get to reading the image.

**- Physical Exam:**   
*""Heart: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.*  
 *Lungs: some crackling at the base of the lungs bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation.*  
 *Abdomen: Abdomen mildly distended, appropriately tender to palpation, incision clean/dry/intact,*   
 *JP drains x2 with serosanguinous drainage""*  
Obviously, focus most on the system related to the surgery the patient had (if you're on general surgery this will typically be the abdomen). For the most part I would just say H/L exams normal/unchanged and then quickly mention the abdominal exam and that was enough for most people.

**- Assessment / Plan:**  
Always, always, ALWAYS come up with some sort of plan, even if you have no idea and it's completely wrong. Sometimes people will also interrupt you here but again, just go with it. As a general rule of thumb, at least at my institution:  
*-- Day 1: make sure pain is well controlled. Encourage sips of clear liquids and make sure this is tolerated without nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain. If the patient begins to pass gas or have BMs, switch them to a GI soft diet. Make sure the patient breathes into the incentive spirometer 10x/hr to prevent atelectasis. Encourage ambulation if the patient can tolerate it.*  
*-- Day 2: Definitely begin to encourage ambulation. If the patient has had good, clear urine output, remove the foley and see if they pee (trial of void). If their pain is well-controlled, remove the PCA (patient controlled analgesia). Same deal, if they passed gas / had a BM you can up them to a GI soft diet.*  
*-- General: JP drains can be removed once their output drops to < 40-50ccs over a 24h period. If people go multiple days and they still don't pass gas / they vomit or are nauseous etc, suspect ileus vs. bowel obstruction and get an abdominal XRAY. Consider putting in an NG-tube, etc.*  
*-- Electrolytes: For electrolyte abnormalities, there's a lot that can be said but I personally encountered issues with potassium the most so I'll just mention something brief about that: if the patient is hypokalemic, given them 10mEq of KCl for every 0.1 K that they're low. Hypokalemia/magnesia can contribute to bowel ileus. If they're hyperkalemic but asymptomatic, given them kayexalate or some other potassium binder. If they're hyperkalemic and they have EKG changes, you can give them IV calcium gluconate / insulin / glucose.*  
Really, for discharge, you need three things:   
**Off IV meds / pain controlled on oral meds**  
**the patient should be passing gas/having BMs + tolerating a diet**  
**they need to be able to ambulate.**

# OR Hacks

I initially disliked this phrase because at the beginning of my rotation I didn't really get what it meant and I constantly felt that the issue was that I didn't know what to do next / help out with it because I had just never encountered that environment / situation before, **not** because I wasn't ""situationally aware."" This was super frustrating at first, but I eventually came to realize what people meant.

In the OR, **most medical students are in the way**. It's a fast-paced environment, and especially at first, you will always be in the way and it will feel like you are always in the way. If you can stay out of the way, you will impress a few people. If you can stay out of the way **and be helpful**, you will impress a lot of people. A lot of this would be obvious in other settings but the stress of being in the OR for the first time can make your common sense go out the window. Some examples:

1. Get your own gown and gloves before you enter the room.
2. Like I mentioned earlier, tying the gowns of scrub nurses to let the other nurses in the room continue gathering supplies, etc.
3. Get the bed with the patient from outside the room, help position the patient, put on their compression stockings, get blankets/pillows, etc.
4. The attending/residents **and** scrub nurse get first priority when it comes to positioning around the table. Let them figure out where they're going to stand first and then ask where the best spot for you to stand is.
5. During the procedure - if the bed is moved, **move the lights**. Surgery is all about visibility/exposure.
6. If somebody asks for suture, ask for the suture scissors. You'll probably get asked to cut the suture. If somebody asks you to hold a retractor multiple times in a row, you can just grab it from them the following time it's directed your way.

**Foleys:** Watch a few videos of setting up and placing a foley. Somebody will walk you through doing it but it's considerably easier if you have some prior idea of what to do the first time you do it.

**Suturing:** You will suck at suturing the first time you do it. You know it, the residents know it, and the scrub nurses and anesthesia knows it. It's okay. People will teach you and you will get better with time - don't get phased if people seem grumpy or annoyed that the case takes an extra 10-15 minutes because it's taking you awhile to close an incision or port site. That being said, if you're interested in surgery, definitely practice on your own. I used [this kit to practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Training-Include-Non-Absorbent-Surgical/dp/B07HQD6WRX/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=suture+kit&qid=1639251849&sr=8-3) and it seemed to serve me well.

# Concluding Thoughts

This ended up being WAY longer than I thought it would. I don't even know if anybody will actually read through all of it. That being said, the main take-aways are to be nice to everyone, be \*intentionally\* helpful, be aware of your surroundings, be interested without being annoying and get to know the people on your team even if they initially seem cold or distant. I went into my surgery rotation terrified of being miserable and screwing up and while I did screw up many times I still came out having had a terrific experience and with some new friends to boot.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/re7dsp/a_guide_to_surgery_how_to_survive_and_enjoy_your/
asszna,Grad students have to listen to our bodies during times of stress because our minds are too busy to realize we're stressed out,"Hey everyone,

So, I don't know if others can relate, but I find that because 1) PhD program's demand that you constantly be producing and working and 2) it is often the case that very ""go-go-go"" people are attracted to/ excel within academia, it is easy to not register when you are stressed out.

Within academia, I think the line between enjoying your work and over-working yourself is thin and that, as a result, it is hard to identify when you start pushing yourself too far, which is only magnified by the fact that, because we are constantly spending so much of our emotional and intellectual energy on our work, we tend to forget to check in with ourselves.

Something I have realized (I am currently in my 3rd year of my PhD program after doing a 2 year Masters) is that my body will tell me that I am stressed out long before my mind will start to register it, and that paying attention to your body and the signs it gives you in regards to being stressed is key to promoting your mental health within academia.

I feel like these ‚Äúsigns‚Äù vary from person to person, but for me, they are often:

1. Troubles sleeping - either insomnia, particularly even after taking sleeping pills, or waking up throughout the night. 

2. Having achy and sore muscles ‚Äì this is typically more than the usual back/trap pain and elbow/wrist pain associated with extensive laptop use. For example, my legs get very lethargic when I am stressed, even after a good night sleep. 

3. Feeling abnormally warm ‚Äì my body temperature is consistently higher. 

4. Feeling exhausted and lethargic during the day even after a good sleep

5. Heart palpitations that do not seem to be linked to anything 

6. Craving sugar or alcohol ‚Äì not just liking or desiring these things, but legit craving them

7. Increased anxiety that typically is not socially motivated: for example, during high times of stress I am more likely to check to see if my oven is on before leaving the house even if I know it‚Äôs off, but personally, I do not feel more anxious around other people (I am also more of an extravert).

8. Increased irritability 

9. Changes in appetite ‚Äì a few years ago, my appetite went up when I was stressed, but now it decreases. However, in general, I will engage in more ‚Äúemotional‚Äù eating when stressed.

Edit. 10. Sometimes my left eye will twitch. 

Can you all relate? Are there any physical signs that you experience that signal to you that you may be stressed even when your mind doesn‚Äôt register it?

1lfe8oh,I've become disillusioned from my Ph.D. and need advice on how to move forward,"I (M 27) am a third year Ph.D. student at a modestly ranked university in France (QS 400-500) in computer science.

I pursued my bachelors and master's at this same university, and hence my feeling is that I lacked the right exposure to other universities and campuses, that could have helped me determine the real value of pursuing a Ph.D.

In my country it takes roughly 5 years to complete a Ph.D. in this field, I currently have 3 conference publications, 1 of which is ranked CORE A, and 2 CORE B (with one of them having won best paper award). All of these publications are 2 authors with me being the first in all of them. This is because there is only one additional student that lacks motivation to do actual work.

The moment when I realized that the Ph.D. may not be for me, is that I've found myself coding and engineering during 99% of my Ph.D. studies. My writing is generally horrible, and without heavy assistance from my advisor I would have never been able to publish something. Of course I don't regret spending time in coding, as at this point I think this may be the only thing that I may be able to do after my Ph.D. studies. This is not just my speculation but also a conclusion that I've reached looking at the 2 previous students from my group that graduated and all ended up doing jobs that they could have done straight out of their masters.

At this point all I'm wondering is how should I move forward. One one hand I've spent a long time on this Ph.D., but on the other hand I don't want to fall into the sunken-cost fallacy. Given the fact that my university is ranked lowly, and that students with a similar background to mine all ended up finding jobs that are not particularly related to what they have researched, I'm currently pondering whether I should just look for a normal job now without wasting more time.

If you have also faced a similar situation how did you move forward? Did you regret your choice of staying/dropping out?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1lfe8oh/ive_become_disillusioned_from_my_phd_and_need/

18eatdg,Choosing to do a PhD has been one of the worst mistakes of my life,"I love my research (mass comm, focus on social media and health) but I have never felt more alone and broken in my entire life. These have been the worst three years of my life as I have had to navigate a program that is extremely toxic, competitive, full of gaslighting, and where if you don‚Äôt constantly beg or apologize you will be punished in some way. I have been demeaned in group settings. I get snarky comments if I ask for help or clarification, if I get help at all. 

I got pregnant my first semester of the PhD. I thought I was going to have a beautiful family and career. Wrong. My ex husband abandoned me, pregnant, a thousand miles away from all of my friends and family. I have a beautiful little boy. I had him in the summer and went back to the PhD when he was six weeks old. Imagine taking care of a newborn and pumping in a PhD program BY YOURSELF. I‚Äôm fucking exhausted mentally and physically every single day. I got sexually assaulted on campus, the individual still works there with no repercussions that I know of. I have an eating disorder and while I was healthy during pregnancy and postpartum, it got MUCH WORSE this past year. I have had to go to the hospital multiple times. I worked on coursework and attended research meetings in the hospital. I had a feeding tube on my face and I still came to campus for all of my TA duties and most of my classes. ‚ÄúPut your health first‚Äù but every email or conversation makes it clear the expectation is that the PhD has to come before my health or even my child. 

While in this program I have published and presented at multiple conferences and workshops, one even being an international conference while I was breastfeeding and took my son with me. Despite my difficult pregnancy and anorexia almost killing me twice this year, I have met basically all goals and expectations of the program. I am only one semester behind compared to peers. I have more publications coming out. But I feel like they don‚Äôt see any value in me as a scholar or colleague. I‚Äôm just seen as the whiny anorexic woman with a baby. 

How do I get through this? I‚Äôm intelligent enough and have the work ethic to earn a PhD, but I literally cry on my drive to campus because its such a negative place and idk how to emotionally get through this. I need to get through this for my little boy. For our futures. I have an amazing therapist at least, but it feels far too late to transfer.

1) Thank so many of you for the kind words. I am supposed to enter treatment for my eating disorder on Monday, praying my LOA request gets approved.

It‚Äôs become clear I‚Äôm not naturally inclined toward this kind of work. I hate reading and writing papers, and I find myself savoring any break from my desk: meals, random chores, even the daily commute. Returning to the work fills me with dread. In my most recent graduate-level class, I got the lowest score on a research project.

If I continue down this path, I doubt I‚Äôll become a superstar researcher. At best, I‚Äôd be average/mediocre‚Äîcontributing papers that likely make no real impact on the field.

I sometimes daydream‚Äîseriously‚Äîabout returning to the outdoor manual labor job I had in high school. Back then, life felt simpler, and my mental health was better. The idea of giving up research for something more grounded and physically engaging is more than a fantasy; I seriously consider it, despite the inevitable drop in income.

I‚Äôve pretty much reached All-But-Dissertation (ABD) status. It will take only about 4 papers and a dissertation made from them to graduate. 1 to 2 more years would be enough time to finish.

With potentially as little as 1 year left, could dropping out and saving the 1 year of opportunity cost be rational, especially if I likely wouldn't even pursue a research job/career after graduating?

1n3avor,"Scrub techs, whats the deal?","I dont understand. Almost every scrub tech I met on my surgery rotation were complete and utter jackasses who sadistically thrived off of the minutia of power they held over med students.

Many of them would literally SCREAM at students (for the most minor of things) and did cruel things to students. I understand maintaining sterility and a student should be corrected if there is concern for that, but what I experienced and saw was just bullying the med students.

One scrub tech made one student scrub his nails for 5 MINUTES straight - until his nails/nail bed literally started bleeding. One made a student put on 3 layers of scrub booties over his shoes, and he was walking around in the OR trying not to slip. One grabbed a students arm so hard it left a bruise. One refuses to gown med students, demanding students self gown because she is too lazy. I once overheard a few scrub techs sitting at the OR nurses station, laughing, imitating, and making fun of a nervous classmate of mine in the OR, and saying how embarrassing it was for her.

These are just a few stories from just my rotation cohort group.

They know students cannot do shit about it. These scrub techs have worked at the hospital for 30+ years, they are best friends with the attendings we scrub in with. So the attendings dont give a shit. The residents dont give a shit. Nobody gives a shit when the med students are treated like subhumans.

Nobody sticks up for the med student being literally bullied by expendable people who are insecure that in literally 2 years, this med student will be giving them orders. So they take advantage of these students while they can.

Genuinely made my surgery rotation utter hell working with 90% of scrub techs. 10% were really amazing, just great people. But the overwhelming majority were insufferable, insecure, egotistical, sadistic maniacs. There are serious issues with the scrub tech culture where they think this is okay. I slept 5 hours every night, waking up at 4am and sleeping at 10/11pm. I worked like a dog from 4:45am-7pm. I studied as much as i could from 7-10pm. I was chronically exhausted, mentally drained. So with all of that, you also have to deal with some low life scrub tech who is so insecure about their job, that they have to flex some temporary power they have over their future boss.

1jfx94x,Multiple Absences But Don't Want Consequences,"So here is my rant for today because I am angry and fed up. There is attendance policy for the entire school and we are able to craft our own in our individual departments. The rate of excessive absentism has gotten so bad over the years that even the Deans and Dept Chairs are tired of ""grandma or grandpa"" dying once a semester or twice. Without documentation within a certain time frame you cannot be officially excused. Now that we have gone past Midterm, all failing students are overwhelmed and more concerned about their excessive absences.

What I am angry about is how you can cover the Absence policy in detail, explain the damn consequences and have students to sign a contract, and yet they do not want the policy applied to them or they want you to tell them before they hit the ""magic number"" that they have messed up. I am nobody's personal assistant or secretary. 

The LMS is open and transparent. But hell they don't even read the comments you leave as feedback or announcements.  Or I did not see that announcement and my favorite is, "" I don't think I should be penalized because I have a good excuse. Or I put in for an excuse from Student Affairs but then it never comes.

I am truly upset because students are lying more than ever on professors in attempts to play ignorant to make you look like the ""bad guy"" when they are withdrawn or dropped a letter grade after being gone 2 months, 7 or 6 days and you have documented it, until your fingers bleed blue. Then it's ""you can't do this to me and ""I am going to the Dean, not realizing that Dean approved the Attendance/ Absent policies before they entered the school.

1kiibcl,What's your grad school hot take?,"current almost graduating BS student, got one more semester for grad prereqs to save time later ironically lol. Mine's a more non trad path, worked 2ish years relevantly, mostly to productively reduce burnout. my lab buddies say I should go for it rn straight outta undergrad. I will not do this.

Here's my hot take, no one should be going straight BS -> MS -> PhD. the BS to MS I can see, but anything more than that is asking for a lot of commitment when you haven't (usually) had a real chance to gain work experience >1 year. There needs to be space between you and school for X time. I just see so much regret along that path.

I greatly respect grad school and research, and one day do plan on hopping back in, but I feel like in fields that are applied, you should think about this more and gain a network and industry work experience. ""Those who can't do, teach"" is so so wrong, but I think undergrads value it more if you can connect to the real world instead of heavily theoretical calcs if you're wanting to teach.

Hows it going for you and your non-medical student significant others?

(MS3 in Arizona here) It‚Äôs been progressing over the past two years. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs been all bad, there‚Äôs plenty of amazing times but maybe because I learned. How to avoid triggering my wife? I do my best to make time and I study from home when I know she‚Äôs home. I try to make small trips and go out for dinner here and there. Even after 15+ hour days I come home tired but never moody. She works too but for her it‚Äôs like all hands in deck and if she works too long she gets super moody and takes her anger out on anything I do wrong that normally isn‚Äôt a problem. I tell her many times to take care of her sleep and eat and take breaks just so I can avoid the fallout when she‚Äôs at that end of the week burnout BS. 

Besides that idk if it‚Äôs my profession but she gets super insecure and it becomes toxic to the relationship. Sometimes I avoid collaborating with any women with research or presentations just to avoid a problem. And if she gets mad about anything, she always wants to leave for the day or give me the silent treatment and that really hurts my mental peace because I spend my days at the hospital if she doesn‚Äôt block me trying to reason with her. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and what‚Äôs been creeping in my mind is a divorce because I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who if feel sometimes I have to walk on egg-shells around and so such a flight risk it makes me insecure about the future and to be frank, I rather divorce now with no children and in student debt than if it‚Äôs expected later.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm really nervous to share this, but I could use some advice and support. I‚Äôm in a PhD program in the UK that follows a 3+1 structure (one year of research methods courses, then three years for the PhD). I had health issues in my first year and considered dropping out, but in my second year, I changed supervisors and have been working on finding a solid research topic.

The problem is, I feel completely lost. My field is new to me, and I struggle with ADHD (was unmedicated from Sept to Sept last year and part of this year). I‚Äôve been working long hours‚Äîsometimes 12-hour days‚Äîbut without structure, and I end up feeling like a jack of all trades, master of none. I get overwhelmed, burn out, and then fall into a cycle of depression.

I recently found out from my landlord that my housing contract is fixed until next year, so I‚Äôll be paying rent regardless. That realization pushed me to commit to finishing, and I asked my supervisor for clearer milestones and guidance. His response was that I should determine my own milestones, which I understand is part of independent research, but I‚Äôm struggling to structure my work effectively.

I want to finish, I really do. I don‚Äôt care about having a social life right now‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt want to hate myself for failing. I‚Äôve been sober from self-medicating with weed and trying to get my ADHD under control, but I feel like I‚Äôm constantly running in circles.

I guess I‚Äôm reaching out to ask:
	‚Ä¢	How do you create structure in such an independent research environment?
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way through?
	‚Ä¢	Any tips for breaking out of this cycle of feeling overwhelmed and stuck?

I appreciate any support or advice. Thanks for reading.

This is my 3rd job and I‚Äôve been promoted as a team lead of the Data Science Unit. To be fair, I‚Äôve gained all of my knowledge in the field through mentors, personal projects and work expirience.

Other than the personal health and mental health issues which played a part in my decision, I felt that my program was a disappointment. Due to the pandemic everything was online last minute and the adjustment was a struggle for my peers and professors. It seemed that education became a second thought to some of my professors. 

I was doing very well in my classes, but I also realized that I quickly started to lose interest. I was excited about grad school but I believe a big reason I applied was because I felt that I ‚Äúshould‚Äù go to grad school and I wanted the title, rather than truly wanting the further education. 

I decided that it was not worth continuing with something that was negatively affecting my health, something I was no longer interested in, and receiving a poor education during a pandemic that would also put me into debt to continue.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pfw7vl/i_did_it_i_dropped_out/
1m5bulk,Type B+ Educators,"I've heard ""Type B+"" floating around to describe some K-12 educators, but I definitely think there's a lot in higher Ed who fit this personality type as well. First, I think the whole binary ""Type A/Type B, Introvert/Extrovert"" way of organizing people is dumb. I think often people identify with a typology, then pursue behaviors related to it.*

""Type B+"" educators have interesting qualities divorced from Type A/B typologies. It gets its name because it supposedly describes teachers who aren't as high strung or organized as ""Type A"" people, but are more reliable and consistent then ""Type B"" people. However, I don't think it's so much a Goldilocks situation as a different thing entirely. 

I think Type B+ educators are actually just really good at prioritization. Or, at the very least, are very intentional. They don't commit to everything, but what they do commit to they put in at least a baseline amount of effort. Their classes have structure, but also have breathing room. They're willing to hear out students on a case by case basis, but have consistent principles (is the request creating more work for me/unfair to other students). They know that Good Enough is Good Enough when it really is Good Enough. They won't probably go as high as the ""Type A"" people, but also won't burn out nearly as fast and didn't really have the ambition anyway. They aren't as burnt out as their Type B peers, either, because they aren't always playing catch up. 

I'm in my fifth year of teaching and a lot of what I've tried to emulate I realize is from my Type B+ professors. If I don't have ADHD, I do have a lot of the tendencies, particularly around how my brain and body respond to task management. I'm constantly managing how much attention and brain power I'm using to make sure I don't overstimulate and breakdown. Again, it's not about being organized. I know a lot of people, especially in academia, who have beautiful planners and calendars with everything neatly written down who are still wildly overwhelmed because they've taken on too much** or over-value certain tasks; 10 minutes tasks become 30 minute tasks. 

It's tough to articulate. I have two sports analogies if that helps:

The baseball player that is good at hitting not because of power or placement but because they're really good at seeing balls and strikes and putting themselves into good situations so they over perform their ability to actually swing the bat

The ""3-and-D"" basketball player, players who are mostly just really good 3-point shooters and passers who are good enough defensively. Not the best player on the team but very consistent and can sometimes over-perform. 

Type B+ faculty are the ones I've had as mentors and the ones who I most enjoy working with. Curious if others have come across this and can relate?

*Except sibling order. Anecdotally, I think tropes associated to first-born, middle, youngest, or only children play out very consistently.

1jyhh1l,New Adjunct Instructions,"Hello Everyone,

I recently accepted an adjunct teaching role after hearing positive things about the opportunity, hoping it would be financially worthwhile. Unfortunately, the reality of the situation has been quite different, and I‚Äôm feeling incredibly overwhelmed. In just the past month leading up to the start date, the stress has been affecting me physically and emotionally.

The position is a 10-week course, and the compensation is $1,650 total. Now that I‚Äôve had time to really think about it, I can‚Äôt help but ask myself why did I agree to this in the first place? I‚Äôm feeling frustrated and regretful. I tend to follow through with things once I‚Äôve started, but I also worry constantly, which makes it difficult to walk away, even when I know it‚Äôs not right for me.

The interview didn‚Äôt give me the impression that there would be room for growth; it felt more like, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the job is, take it or leave it.‚Äù That has stuck with me. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I keep jumping from one unfulfilling job to another. I really need some advice. Is it too late to step away from this adjunct position? Is there a professional way to exit without burning bridges?

Thank you all in advance for your insight and support.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1jyhh1l/new_adjunct_instructions/
1lcl2y8,Words of advice for those starting or thinking about earning a PhD.,"Hey folks. I see a lot of questions about earning PhDs, poorly informed assumptions, and so on. It's early summer and the Fall session will start in a few months. I thought I would offer a perspective of someone who finished their PhD and had their own struggles. Here are 10 things to consider as you start this journey:

1. Treat your PhD as a salaried job and accept that you have the worst salary ever. It sucks. Everything else follows this. If you think you're going to have some glorious side hustle, you're probably wrong. If you think you can work full time and finish a PhD, you'll have challenges doing this. It's a commitment. You need to be in the lab, in the field, running experiments, etc.  You need to get your life sorted out before embarking on this journey.
2. Your PI is not your friend. They are your supervisor first and foremost. They are not there to babysit you. They are going to give you feedback and you may not like it. It might hurt your feelings, make you feel insecure, give you imposter syndrome, and whatever else. It doesn't mean you're stupid. You need to develop strategies to deal with this. You need to have some sort of a support group.
3. Your PI's behavior is influenced by what made them successful. Unfortunately, this can include them being assholes to people, including you. They're probably in tenured positions, experts in their fields, and so on. It's not that they're untouchable, but they are hard to replace due to their expertise. You need to figure out how to work in their orbits. This isn't the same as dealing with misconduct. That's not acceptable and should be dealt with accordingly.
4. Know that your PI and faculty are investing in you and they do care. You're taking space and scarce resources in their programs and labs. They chose you and want you to succeed. The lack of your success reflects badly on them and the programs.
5. Do not fuck your lab mates, literally or figuratively. You are not on Grey's Anatomy. These are people you need to work with, need to rely on, and that you're stuck with for multiple years. Drama is fucking annoying.
6. Your labmates are looking out for their own success before your success. Your investments in them may or may not be reciprocated. It's a job at the end of the day for them too. This isn't to say that you won't make friends in your lab. On the contrary, you'll make friends for life unless you're the asshole.
7. If you think you need daily supervision, perhaps a PhD isn't for you yet. Your independence is expected in a PhD program. This isn't the same as mentorship and receiving guidance though. That's to be expected.
8. You're going to have low moments and at some point,  it may break you. Some of these moments include prepping and finishing your qualification exams (or equivalent), proposals and defenses, department presentations, journal submissions and the utter joys of peer review, some fuckup with data collection, figuring out what is your unique contribution to your field, some class you're taking, an undergrad in the class you're TA'ing that's being a pain in your ass, etc. You need to have a support system and be able to channel your stress, anxiety, and whatever else productively. Figure this out early in your program.
9. Your success depends on one or a combination of these: Hard work, working smarter, or having a professional network that you can leverage. Figure out which one you are. Figure out who/what compliments you.
10. Your time spent in your program will strain your existing relationships. You're around a bunch of very smart people for long periods of time. You'll see these people probably more so than your spouse, partner, etc. In stressful situations, people bond over the stress. If you are married, in a long-term relationship, etc., the chance of those persisting through grad school and surviving isn't very high. It'll take effort to maintain these. Most people I knew that were in relationships finished their programs being single or with someone they met in their program.

1i8e3cf,My mom just got diagnosed with cancer. What do I do?,"My mom had a surgery a few weeks ago in which they found and removed a mass from one of her lymph nodes. She got the biopsy results back today, it‚Äôs late-stage ovarian cancer. 

I‚Äôm a sophomore preparing to be admitted into (ironically) the radiation therapy program at my school. Due to my financial situation, I cannot take a gap year or drop out (I will lose my main scholarship). 

I‚Äôve already emailed all of my professors, my boss, and I‚Äôve made an appointment to meet with my advisor on Monday. I don‚Äôt know what things will look like yet, how this will impact my performance, so I just let my professors know what‚Äôs going on and that I might need some flexibility throughout the semester. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve already done everything that I can do right now, but they don‚Äôt really prepare you for this stuff. I‚Äôm still in shock and everything is a blur, I want to get everything taken care of now so that any issues can be anticipated. Is there anything else I should do? Or, if anyone has gone through something similar, do you have any advice for handling this situation? Like I said, dropping out/taking time off will be a last resort - I am planning on doing my best to keep up with my work.

Edit: I should add that I only have two in-person classes on T/Th, so I work on MWF. The rest of my classes are online. They are all pretty manageable this semester, so I think I will be able to balance my schoolwork with being at home with my mom.

1fpteju,"I can see the end of it, maybe?","**Third-year PhD student in Europe here, and I‚Äôve been through a lot.**

My supervisors (a husband-and-wife duo) bullied me, isolated me from the research group, publicly humiliated me, and constantly reminded me how ""stupid and unprofessional"" I was. It was emotionally draining, and at one point, I told them I was quitting my PhD and walking away from research entirely.

The next day, the university notified us that my supervisor had been fired. That was one of the happiest days of my life. There was a court case, but thankfully, she couldn‚Äôt return to her position.

However, things took another turn. They tried blackmailing me, saying I wouldn‚Äôt graduate unless I somehow got her reinstated as my supervisor. They used ""ethics"" as their excuse, claiming my research topic was hers, so I couldn‚Äôt proceed without her.

Now, though, I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel although I am not done yet. I just need to understand these ethical parts where my topic, my papers and my samples are involved but It looks like I‚Äôll be able to move on, break free from them, and continue my research the way I want. I‚Äôm so relieved and happy.

1iy6jld,To dropout or not?,"I am a 28M PhD student from Southeast Asia, in a top US university doing ML and Computational Mechanics, and I am currently thinking of possibly dropping out of the program. I will be doing my preliminary exam soon, and after that if I decide to drop out, I can leave with a Masters.

I still do like the work that I am doing, however my values have shifted after 1.5 years in now. Throughout these 1.5 years, I have been traveling back to my homecountry during each break (winter and summer), to see my family and my girlfriend who we have decided to happily get married this year. I stayed for 2 months during the summer, and worked towards my research, and got a paper out last year from my remote summer research.

This year, I have been told by my PI that it will not be great for the group, and it will be too much to leave for more than a month, and I can now only do one month once a year moving forward (even with remote research). We have talked about this, and since I am attached to my life at my homecountry, my PI decided that I could work towards early graduation in less than 2 years. However, I now value the frequency and length of stay of traveling back home throughout the program. I realized I am basically tied in the grad school loop now, which have no certainty of how much travel I can do in the coming future, and that is important to me. 

I understand that operating a Lab is just like a small business, and its not great seeing your employees go off on remote work for months. Unfortunately, its just that I (we) have differing values now, and I value the people and connections around me. 

I started the PhD aiming for a chance to work in the intersection of Science and AI, after some industry experience as a ML engineer, as I noticed some downsides of (past) algorithms during my time as an engineer. Now, most of my research (the technical details, formulation and the ideation) has been driven by me, with my advisor giving minimal inputs as he is busy. 

I believe that I am capable enough of standing on my own with my experience in industry, and even with a Masters, I will land somewhere, where someone will value my worth. I also want to start my own startup one day, to work on AI4Science.

1m91xp7,Does anyone else admit academia is just a job and not their lofty ‚Äùcalling‚Äù?,"I think work/life balance is important. My family and friends, they are my calling. Those are the people I live for, not this job and not these increasingly lazy and entitled kids. 

I don‚Äôt understand people who wax poetically that this profession is their lofty calling, that they were called to do this job. Part of me is certain they‚Äôre just virtue signaling because that‚Äôs what people/admins/students want to hear and these same people are also painfully vain with unnecessary superiority complexes.

I want to be clear: I enjoy my job as a university professor and I work incredibly hard at it; getting a PhD is never easy. We all know that. But this job is not my ‚Äúcalling‚Äù. 

Especially in this current day of Gen Z, we‚Äôre expected to bend over backwards 10x even more so than ever before dealing with all the AI headaches, overbearing admin, and everything else. We are not customer service reps.

I love my job and I‚Äôve worked very hard to get my doctorate and be the veteran professor I am today, but it‚Äôs important to me personally that I remember: at the end of the day it‚Äôs still just a job. It‚Äôs just a job, people. Nothing else. Don‚Äôt let it eat you alive.

And I don‚Äôt hear a lot of people say that, at least not in my little ecosystem. It‚Äôs all lofty self-congratulatory praise for our profession, and it‚Äôs navel-gazing bullshit like this that makes those not in academia think we are all elitists when I know so many of us are not.

Edit: the vast majority of people in the comments get what I‚Äôm saying, and I am truly grateful for your support but for the small percent that don‚Äôt they clearly didn‚Äôt read my post in full and they‚Äôre just projecting their own insecurities.

behfte,"Today, my fellow (PGY6) made me cry... [Well-being]","I have the tendency to get long-winded, but I'll try to keep this brief... I am currently on a Peds ID rotation. The fellow that I am working with has a reputation for being tough on students. I was determined not to let this change my expectations going into the rotation. 

Backstory: Throughout the entirety of medical school, I have been well below average. My preclinical class rank was bottom 10, my step score was unremarkable, and I killed a simulated patient on an OSCE during a prior clerkship leading to me tanking the clerkship (long, painful story). So needless to say, heading into this pediatrics clerkship, I was not very confident in my abilities.

My first patient on my peds ID rotation is a pyomyositis. I run through my presentation to the team and get hit with the standard pimp questions (staph aureus, staph aureus, staph aureus). My fellow digs in a little bit and hits me with some tougher pimp questions; somehow, by a twist of fate, I know the answers to these questions. The day goes on with your typical win-some-lose-some.

Day two of the rotation, I was asked to present on a neonatal HSV patient, but due to mandatory rotation lectures (yay), I didn't even get to see this patient. So I had to go off of my memory of the chart and my limited knowledge of neonatal HSV. So at this point, I know I am tanking, especially in front of a tough fellow.

Day three of the rotation (today), no new patients, so just your typical follow-up. Towards the end of the day, I nervously ask the fellow for feedback. She looks at me, takes a deep breath, says ""well,"" pauses, and then proceeds to tell me that I have blown her away with my knowledge base and organization style during patient presentations and succinct assessments/plans on my notes. She tells me that I should be incredibly proud and called me the smartest medical student that she's ever worked with.

Now, again, to reiterate... I am an idiot... I have been consistently at the bottom throughout the entirety of medical school. And any praise that I've gotten from attendings has always been focused on my personality and patient rapport. But hearing this fellow refer to me as intelligent - which was the first time I've heard that throughout all of medical school - brought tears to my eyes. I weakly said thank you, quickly dismissed myself to the bathroom, and cried my eyes out. Now it's likely a rare sight to see a big black guy bawling like a baby... but today was the day.

I share my experience with you because I know that I am not the only student out there who has been fighting off imposter syndrome since day zero. I know that I am not the only student who has STRUGGLED and FAILED to stay within one standard deviation of the mean on tests. I know that I am not the only student who thinks (s)he is an idiot. I know that I am not the only student who has wondered out loud if (s)he was simply an affirmative action admission or ""good for optics.""

Whoever is believing some or all of these same self-destructive thoughts circulating through you mind, just know that you are not defined by your past failures. As long as you continue to give it your all, you will make the right impression on the right person.

1mpji38,"Advice Needed: Committee member has not given feedback until the last possible moment, potentially breaching professional ethics","I will keep this as brief as possible. Thank you in advance for clicking on my post. Any advice or recommendations are highly appreciated.

My PhD has been a living hell, and when I thought I was done, things could not get any worse; they got worse. My PhD is in a STEM field, and I have been working on it for three years now. For context, I have my advisor from my university, and one of my committee members, whom I will call ""Jim"", was essentially my boss and in charge of my research. Jim is the worst possible kind of academic in every conceivable way. He has no interest in pushing science forward and only likes safe, reliable research that can guarantee the results match his hypothesis and previous findings, as Jim only cares about the accolades and status. Every other scientist and researcher at the lab refused to work with Jim because everyone knew he was toxic. Jim has even encouraged me to fabricate results to make them better fit his expectations. When I refused, I was forced to redo the experiment until the results matched, which they never did. I've brought up these issues with my advisor multiple times. Still, nothing has changed, likely because my advisor previously worked with Jim.

My research focus has changed multiple times against my will. Due to government layoffs, my research was cut short, and I had to move back to my university. My defense date and all associated deadlines were moved up by six months (not my idea). This required me to compile all of my research and write the remaining 75% of my dissertation, plus conduct research and write an additional chapter/article in less than three months. Still, I met every deadline and successfully defended over a month ago. I received some pretty scathing but valid comments on my writing and figures. I followed all the edits and sent out updated drafts with details about the edits made nearly every other day until my committee requested I stop until I provide the final version. I sent out my ""final"" draft two weeks ago and finally got some feedback today. According to my advisor, four out of the five committee members are ready to sign and submit to the school; however, one member, Jim, has finally given his feedback. The edits he is requiring are substantial revisions to my entire document, including rewriting my entire introduction/literature review. The edits required can be done in a week if I work non-stop for 12+ hours a day and work through the weekend. However, even if I pull that off, the absolute last possible day that we can submit this to the university is next week. After reading the comments and puking up my breakfast, I spoke with my advisor, and he essentially told me to get started and that he'll talk with Jim, because that has helped so much in the past. My advisor has already had to request multiple extensions. If we don't submit by next week, I will have to enroll for another semester.

I can't do this anymore on every single level. The funding I receive from my university doesn't even cover the rent for my apartment, and I've exhausted my savings account, leaving me flat broke in likely a month. I've already started doing job interviews, and I doubt they will keep a position open for me. I need a backup plan in the event that my advisor can't change Jim's mind and my committee agrees the edits are necessary. At what point is Jim guilty of academic misconduct or breaching professional ethics? I can only assume that Jim has not read my writing until his ass is on the line, he's trying to screw me over, or both. Jim and the rest of my committee had to sign multiple forms saying they had read through my writing, had comments prepared, and that I was ready to defend. I've read through previous posts with similar topics, and I'm afraid to contact the grad office or speak with the dean of my department because I have no idea what can of worms that will open up. I'd like to believe that things will turn out for the best, but if doing a PhD has taught me anything, it's that it never happens.

Thank you for any guidance in advance. And to any other PhD students out there, your feelings are always valid; we'll all get through this together.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mpji38/advice_needed_committee_member_has_not_given/

113asvp,Is my PhD getting nowhere ?,"Hello guys, been lurking the sub for some time, first time posting. I'm in my third year of my PhD in Italy, Nanotechnology course, and for the last few weeks i've been felling quite down with the state of my PhD, feeling like i'm getting nowhere and i often can't even understand the basics of my field, expecially in data revision and analysis and sometimes in operating with the lab equipment.   
I feel more often than not completely drained of motivation to get stuff done and i find myself drowning in an inch of water, utterly overwhelmed by the task that looms in front of me. I think that played a great part on making me develop a severe procrastination issue; if i don't have any experiment to run, i find myself sitting at the desk in my office for hours, doing anything but work. I feel there is almost nothing that i enjoy about my topic anymore, i simply show up at the lab and do what they tell me to do. I should start to work on my thesis, but i haven't even started to write a paper (i'm not the only one in my year facing this last issue. but still).

My supervisor (actually, my-co supervisor, the one that really works with me) is not happy with that, a couple months ago he we had a long conversation, and he told me that he feels like ""You are only a little more capable to use the instrumentation than you were when you started, you should be autonomous at this point, but i don't feel comfortable leaving alone you and one of the master students with the machine"" and that ""I don't know how i can recommend you to anyone looking for post-docs next year, i don't feel you would be able to handle yourself"". 

  
My PhD school does a mid of the year workshop, where each student presents its result to the rest of the (frankly very heterogeneous, in terms of fields of study) course, that this year comes next week, and with my co-supervisor and others of the group we looked at my presentation today. There were a lot of errors, and they told me that it looks like i'm unable to present and expose my result in an understandable way, and he (the co-sup.) thinks that its because i have still some theorethical doubts. We were planning to do a reversal on Friday, but now i'm not sure if they want to give me some more time or not. In any case, the workshop is due next Wensday,    


I don't know what i can do, i'm very tired, i've also considered taking a break from the project, a couple months just to see if my mental health improves, but here in Italy is not easy to obtain, there are no breaks periods provided by the university, apart from maternity leave, if i'm not mistaken. Maybe is better if i just leave,   


Before you said it, I've tried to have a work-life balance, like i've discovered DnD in the mid of my first year, and now i have two campaigns with friends that i'm Dming weekly, but this hasn't helped with the work, quite the opposite actually it just gave me another excuse to procrastinate, to do other things apart from work. At the same time, this hobby is maybe the most important thing that keeps me going, the thing that gives me joy, so i don't want to abandon it, i feel it would not help me.

1lis21z,PhD Burnout from Racial Bullying,"Does anyone have any advice on how to handle burnout/depression during the graduate program after facing prolonged racial bullying? I desperately need to meet deadlines but am having a hard time focusing on my work.

For some context, I am a third year PhD student and am currently working on my research proposal. Due to factors outside of my control, I ended up having to step up as president of a cultural organization a couple of years ago as no other undergrad was in the position to take on leadership. A larger geopolitical event more than doubled my responsibilities as president even though I tried my best to keep my organization out of the limelight. It was terrible trying to balance all of my professional responsibilities and medical issues with these, but was able to survive the first year.

Starting the second year, a more senior PhD student in a different program on campus began bullying me and some of my friends and enabled outside actors to harass us, too. The school refused to do anything no matter how many times I reported incidents ‚Äì I just got bounced between our Title IX office and the student life office. These incidents happened almost once every two weeks for 8 months straight, so my productivity plummeted and I began avoid campus in case anything turned physical. Thankfully, this PhD student has moved on and now I get to pick up the pieces.

I‚Äôm so burnt out that it‚Äôs hard to even cook food in the microwave, much less actually do my work. I love my research and my advisors are great, so quitting is not an option.

1n698mo,The workload is insane.,"I'm doing an online masters program and the amount of work that is expected of me is insane. I genuinely do not think that I am built for this while I'm working full-time (in an unrelated field also). I've never been the best reader and I'm expected to read like 200 pages per week, and watch videos, and podcasts, and THEN I can start my work. But all my work is due while I'm at my job so I will have to get it done the night before, which adds even more pressure. I do not want to sacrifice sleep because that will affect my performance at work (I work in fast-food currently, and my restaurant actually has standards). I'm taking two 8-week courses currently. 

 It's only been a week, and last week I was out from work with covid, and I just don't see myself being able to keep up. It doesn't help that I'm the only person in my program without relevant work experience (I'm mid 20s and most of the people are mid 30s and up). This is just a lot of added stress to my life and I've already been extremely burnt out recently. 

I don't feel like I'll be able to get the work done without using AI, but that of course defeats the purpose of doing the work at all.

1ilta08,Massive mistake in old MS research,"I just found a massive error in the data collection methodology from my Master's research from 2019. To preface, this research was my first ever real research experience and was definitely a learning curve for me. The methods were super shaky as this was work only me and a postdoc were doing. It was being funded by a pilot grant in collaboration with another lab. Basically we had to build a barrier model that the collaborator lab would use to test toxins, and I had to take specific measurements using electrodes to ensure that the cell layers inside the model were intact. Honestly maybe there are more advanced methods to take these measurements now (not sure as I have since moved on to another research area) but back then I remember really struggling and the whole thing feeling kinda sketchy, like the layers of cells in the model would be disrupted constantly or electrodes would break. Looking back I also think the base conditions of my measurements besides the controls were a little off (potentially incorrect flow rates and cell conditions). I did not publish this anywhere - the conclusion was a poster presentation (not a thesis) at a university symposium for master's students. 

Anyway, I was looking at my old data and I realized as I was looking that I have used the same blank value for every measurement batch across different batches of devices, which obviously doesn't make sense...I looked at my protocols and apparently I had the same 'control' device across every new batch I made, which doesn't make sense at all. So the control number was just the same. 

Basically, I do not trust this data lol. And that would be fine by itself as I know I'm a MUCH more competent scientist now. It doesn't seem like the project has continued in the lab  after the pilot money ran out. Me and the postdoc left the same year so we've been gone 6 years now. However, I am nervous that this data will be used by somebody else someday, either for a future grant application or just to replicate.  This error isn't obvious at first glance, as it's a methodological error. I found out by looking at the data analysis.

Now, my old advisor obviously has all this data. I'm not sure if I should contact him after 6 years and tell him I made this error, or if I should just let it go if it hasn't been picked up by anybody else since then (that I can see through his ongoing grants and the lab website). I'm also assuming he would look through the data analysis before using the data, and come to the same conclusion that the control is the same value for every batch. I don't want him to think I fudged it, I honestly just didn't know any better at the time...

Any advice would be appreciated. I am a 3rd year PhD student now and very stressed üò•",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ilta08/massive_mistake_in_old_ms_research/

*TLDR: For some overachieving may be something positive in their lives, but for me its not. Im fine when anybody else fails and I understand grades are just a small part of life and that it doesnt speak about the person rather than their performance that day, their mood, etc. , but cant for the life of me manage to hold myself to that same standard and Im falling appart.*

Im a college student somewhere in Latin America, Im not sure if your exam systems are the same as mine because for some stuff its quite different, but for my career most subjects you can pass without a final exam if on both previous exams you have a 7 or more for semestral subjects, and on the three previous exams for anual ones. For a mixture of reasons, very strict parents and familly that led to being very strict with myself etc., I never failed a single subject in my entire academic life (exams I have failed, I can count them with one hand), and being in my third year of college I have never gone to a final exam, nor had failed any exam since I got here.

Well that is going to change because today I got a 5 on an exam, since its the last day of class for that subject. This caught me really off guard, Im freaking out, Ive been crying all day and feeling like crap. Now, before someone comes to insult me for this, *I* ***KNOW*** *I have a problem.* I have plenty of friends, even my own SO, who go to finals or get bad grades every once in a while or even all the time and I legitimately dont think less of them because of it, they are great people and smart people and I admire them for many things, but for whatever reason when Im the one who didnt do well I cant cope with that. I feel like a stupid person, which doesnt mean I think that another person in my situation would be stupid because of this.

When you're deep in it, a PhD can feel like everything‚Äîyour identity, your future, the measure of your worth. But it‚Äôs not.

Your work is valuable, but it‚Äôs not as important as it feels right now. The long hours, the stress, the pressure to publish‚Äîit all makes it seem like your entire existence hinges on this one degree. But the truth is, you are so much more than your PhD. You have relationships, interests, skills, and a whole life beyond your research.

And when you finish? A PhD isn‚Äôt a golden ticket to instant success. It‚Äôs a stepping stone, not a finish line. Some doors open, some don‚Äôt, and sometimes the best opportunities come from places you never expected. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to save some of yourself for what comes after‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a career in academia, industry, or something entirely different.

So if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, just remember: your PhD is something you do, not something you are. Keep going, but don‚Äôt lose yourself in the process. There‚Äôs a whole world waiting for you beyond your thesis.

I spend hours preparing.. crafting slides, planning discussions, revising readings, thinking through how to make things clear, relevant, and even engaging.

And yet... I walk into class and half the seats are empty. No emails. No messages. No context. They are not just there.

At first, I brushed it off. ""It's early in the term, they'll warm up."" But now, it's weeks in, and the pattern is setting in. The same names missing. And it's starting to wear me down.

No one really prepares you for this part of the job. The blank stares. The unread announcements. The empty chairs. You go in with energy and intention.. and start to feel like you're delivering a monologue to a room that's only half-listening... if it's even there at all.

zupqyk,Just graduated. You can do it!,"Just finished my last semester with a 3.7 GPA with my bachelor's degree. I had my fair share of coming an inch within dropping out because of my mental health, struggling to pull a passing grade once or twice. Just last semester, I met with a professor in a required class, crying because I was failing, asking for a second chance on ONE assignment. He let me, and I ended up pulling an A when I started with a D. 

Your mental health matters. Take a break if you need to- take a semester off if you can afford it. Take care of yourself. Even if you're just starting, or halfway there- you're almost done. Just get to the end of this semester. Then get through the next. You're almost done, you can do it. Failing is okay. Picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and trying again is what matters. Even if you feel like it isn't worth it, or you aren't good enough: it is. You are.

1e333jz,Transitioning From Tenure Track to Lecturer?,"Hello fellow professors, I‚Äôm curious to know if any of you had positive (or negative) experiences transitioning from a tenure track position to a lecturer position?

To give some context, I finished my 4th year as a tenure track assistant professor in the arts at a regional comprehensive teaching institution. This school has been having major enrollment declines, budget cuts, VERY unclear tenure & promotion guidelines, unclear department evaluation models, and frequent turnover of leadership. I had 3 different department chairs during my 4 years and my Dean just resigned.

In all honesty, I‚Äôm going above and beyond to publish, exhibit, and present at regional, national and international levels. I have to ‚Äòchange the lives of my students‚Äô while demonstrating excellence in my teaching. On top of that, I have to serve on 9 departmental/college/university committees while maintaining my facilities and advising students. I‚Äôm exhausted and I have no work-life balance.

I just got offered a full-time renewable lecturerer position at an R1 school. The thought of becoming a lecturer seems like the right move. The school has growing enrollments and the service requirements are resonable. They can still provide me with professional development funds each year and I don't have the pressure to produce. I can solely focus my attention on teaching and doing service that I enjoy.

Has anyone had any experience transitioning from a tenure track to lecturer position? What has your experience been like? Thanks for sharing!",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1e333jz/transitioning_from_tenure_track_to_lecturer/

1kh7ihj,Took a Research Year for Ortho - Here‚Äôs My Quick Thoughts On The Topic,"**TL;DR**

* Took a research year due to ""meh"" 3rd year grades
* Despite strong clinical evaluations, the Shelf exams were my weakness
* Took **Step 2 before** research year ‚Üí scored **>260** after grinding Divine Intervention ([AMA: Step 2 Score 211 --> 262 real deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1dl9za6/ama_step_2_score_211_262_real_deal/) by[u/LipidLikeaBilayer](https://www.reddit.com/user/LipidLikeaBilayer/) in[Step2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/))
* Did research at my home program (paid), 100% in-person, worked directly with my PI
* Learned stats (SPSS or R), IRBs, writing ‚Äî critical skills if you want to be productive
* Strong advice: **take Step 2 before starting** and **work directly with a surgeon**
* It‚Äôs a grind, but this year gave me real skills and helped reshape my application

  
I‚Äôm writing this because I was advised to take a research year to strengthen my application for orthopedic surgery, primarily due to average third-year clinical grades. I want to help remove the stigma of a research year (it's not the end of the world) and help future students be successful in the Match. I attend a top-40 NIH-funded medical school with a strong orthopedic department, but only average clerkship grades. I had decent ortho mentorship starting early in med school, but my PI already was already mentoring students/residents to their capacity, which limited my ability to get involved in meaningful projects. In hindsight, it was clear that if you‚Äôre not the go-to student for a surgeon, it‚Äôs hard to get on their radar.

Others I know took research years for various reasons‚Äîsome didn‚Äôt have a home ortho program, others had low Step 2 scores or were looking for better mentorship or stronger letters. Personally, I don‚Äôt think a research year is necessary for everyone, but the stigma is definitely fading. That said, from what I‚Äôve seen, those who take a research year to try to compensate for low Step 2 scores tend to struggle more in the match than those who combine strong scores *with* research. I acknowledge my grades weren‚Äôt stellar, but I‚Äôm all-in on ortho and decided this was the best way to invest in my application.

I didn‚Äôt commit to the research year until late into third year. My PI approached me, and after talking it through with mentors, classmates, and matched applicants, I decided to stay at my home institution‚Äîmainly because of my significant other (also in medicine). This allowed me to really focus in on Step 2 and I feel that it is a large reason for why I actually performed well on Step 2. Many of my colleagues relocated for research years and embedded themselves at new institutions where they plan to do sub-internships during fourth year. Everyone I know is working in person, which I believe is crucial if you are going to a different instutition. Some work for a group of surgeons, while others report to just one attending. If possible, I strongly recommend working directly with a single surgeon. Without face time, it‚Äôs very hard to build the kind of personal relationship that leads to meaningful letters and long-term mentorship.

I was fortunate to be in a paid position. That‚Äôs a big deal‚Äîespecially in expensive cities‚Äîbecause many research positions are unpaid, which adds a significant financial burden if you don‚Äôt have outside support. If you're considering a year like this, plan ahead financially. Some of the hardest parts for people I know were not academic, but financial and logistical.

One of the most important decisions I made was taking Step 2 before starting my research year. I highly recommend this approach‚Äîeven if it means starting research a few weeks late. A few of my peers delayed Step 2 until after their research year, and most underperformed or just did okay. Being away from clinical material and trying to study during a full-time research job is a recipe for burnout. **Your #1 priority during a research year should be research.** These jobs don‚Äôt pay enough to justify slacking, and your productivity - measured by manuscripts, presentations, and publications - is ultimately how programs will judge the success of your year.

My daily routine was focused entirely on research. I had the option to spend some days in clinic or the OR, but I opted to go all-in on research (albeit, I did spend a couple days in the OR near the end to brush up on my skills). During the day, I felt an obligation to maximize output since I was getting paid, and I knew that my publication record would be the only objective measure of the work I put in. I also made it a priority to go to all (appropriate) resident learning sessions to just get may face out there. I treated the year like a full-time job‚Äîoften working late, checking email after hours and on weekends, and occasionally going to the office for a few hours on weekends. Though I tried to keep weekends light, the work definitely spilled over. I reported directly to my PI, but I was expected to work independently, manage my own projects, and be self-motivated.

Before the research year, I had around 2‚Äì4 publications either submitted or published and \~10 presentations or posters. At the end of my year, I‚Äôll have over 30 publications submitted or published, with more than 10 as first author. That number may be higher than average‚ÄîI had preexisting relationships with my team and some projects in progress‚Äîbut the key point is that you can achieve a high level of output if you‚Äôre organized, proactive, and focused. Many people that I know were not for various reasons (Step2 studying, going to OR/clinic too much, golfing or rec activities took priority). In the beginning, for most people, it takes at least a few months to get traction. Databases need to be built, IRBs need approval, and it takes time to collect and clean data before you can even start writing.

The most important skill I gained was the ability to perform my own statistical analyses. **This is a non-negotiable if you want to maximize productivity**. It is worth noting, but this is coming from someone with a computer programming degree with 3+ years in industry prior to medical school. You don‚Äôt want to be stuck waiting for a statistician or another student to run numbers for you. Whether you learn SPSS, R, or another program, mastering statistics will make you incredibly valuable. You‚Äôll get asked to help with other projects. You‚Äôll be invited to collaborate with new attendings. If you can bring clean data, run the analysis, and present a draft manuscript, you become a research engine. That‚Äôs when things start to snowball.

I also became proficient with IRB submissions, retrospective study design, data management, and manuscript writing. Retrospective databases, in particular, were the secret weapon. With a solid database, you can ask a huge number of research questions and crank out projects efficiently. Prospective studies are great in theory but are slow, take time to enroll patients, and usually won‚Äôt produce results within a 12-month research year. Retrospective studies are your best chance to build a productive CV.

Reflecting on the year, I feel like I‚Äôve learned how to go from idea to IRB to publication completely independently. Whether or not it helps me match remains to be seen, but the skills I‚Äôve gained are invaluable. Coming from a blue-collar family and background with zero academic exposure or research experience before med school, this year changed the way I view academic medicine. I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy research, but this year helped me realize that I actually love it.

If you're considering a research year, my advice is this: make sure you‚Äôre doing it for the right reasons, take Step 2 beforehand, work directly with a surgeon in person, and learn how to manage data and run your own statistics. This isn‚Äôt an easy year‚Äîit‚Äôs a grind‚Äîbut if you do it right, it can completely change the trajectory of your career. I‚Äôm happy to answer questions below.

  
ETA: the 30+ publications will come from multiple groups across multiple institutions that I have worked with and earned authorship by ICJME standards for authorship. Not all will be accepted at any given time, but rather constitute a distribution across many statuses: published, accepted pending publication, accepted pending revisions, and submitted in review. 

Furthermore, I would like to provide more context. I am a computer programmer with 3+ years in the biotech industry. This also had a lot to do with contributing to my success of my year. Financially, I had a lot saved up from my prior career. - the point of this write up was to highlight the importance of gaining research skills to be successful.

1jdsp9y,HELP picking a specialty,"Okay hello! Sorry in advance for the long post, but I am freaking out. I am from a T5 school with a good step score and really feel all over the place in terms of specialty. I even took a research year to figure it out but I'm just not sure what to do. I keep thinking about what my 40 year old self would want (derm?) but I just don't feel like I had the ""AHA"" moment that I keep hoping for. I am an extrovert who likes interesting things and maybe some chaos and enjoys having fun, but also doesn't want to work too hard and appreciates routine as well. I also want to have a family and not feel like I am always RUNNING or stressed about going to work, as I have went straight through to a top school and have always felt like my life was a big rush. I appreciate any help or guidance, truly :) I am forcing myself to decide by the end of this week. The specialties in med school I liked in alphabetical order:

\- Derm: been to AAD (those free samples) and presented there a few times. I am currently on my research year in dermatology with wonderful and kind mentors but I also have family members who applied into it and I think that's a big factor into my interest. Additionally, everyone and their mother says if I have the scores for it and could see myself doing it, do it bc my 40 year old self would thank me and I see the endless reddit posts that ""derm is a unicorn."" That being said, I really do enjoy the tiny procedures of biopsies, steroid injections, cryotherapy etc. I am not a procedure kind of person in the sense that >15 minute procedures and fine tuning stuff really bore me (no ophthalmology); however, I enjoy working minimally with my hands. I feel like the time I spent in derm outpatient clinic always goes by wonderfully fast. Also I LOVED derm consults and was pretty invested. I think that's also because it's **easy** in the sense that I don't feel overwhelmed often the way I do about the endless bounds of IM, because there's a finite amount of treatments. So I'm not sure if I really adore it, or it's just easy and then very likely in a few years will be **boring**. I am the person who gets bored kind of easily, and I'm not a serious person, so I don't really want to be bored. But I also really don't know about IM and all because I am not a workhorse and didn't like rounding for hours and hours (my program does all standing rounds on olds and news and im not sure if that's standard for other programs, considering my program is a top workhouse program). I have my letters all lined up and applied for aways, but not feeling certain and don't want to apply into something just because it has the best lifestyle. But I do have the scores and research and mentors for it, so I'm not sure if I'm just being an idiot by not going for it. I also have a partner in a tough residency right now and I don't want to feel like less of a doctor/inferior to them/always home by myself lol. Could also use some advice on dual applying derm and IM and how to do that if people think that's the move.

\- Emergency med: pediatric emergency was probably my favorite rotation tied with psych. I only did it for a few weeks but it was super fun and awesome. I am worried about the burnout rate, lower salary, and nights. I also would want relationships with my patients. I appreciate though how if you don't know something, you can consult. With that being said, I know they have the highest burnout rate and I really don't want to miss out on weekends and stuff as an attending. But I like the procedures and the ""little bit of everything"" and I love the chaos sometimes lol. it's just hard because I'm not sure ill still love that as an attending the way I loved it as a med student because if I didnt know something the resident would help, but as an attending the job can seem very stressful of course and maybe my 40 year old self would want something more predictable. Also this sounds bad but if I have great scores, not sure if I should do something more competitive. Could also do anesthesia but missing long term follow-up, and I am an extrovert as well so I enjoy talking with patients.

\- Internal medicine: could see myself doing GI. Enjoyed rotating at an outside hospital in IM, but didn't like my workhorse program that made me do a bunch of nights in a row. Kind of a bucket because I feel like I have a lot of interests and can do procedures like GI or do skin stuff in rheum. But I'm not sure how bad life will be in residency because again my program is a workhorse program where residents come in on gen medicine at 4:45 AM. I just really don't want to work so hard that I feel stressed about going to work even on days I am off. But I really enjoy the team aspect and working in the team room, bonding with co-residents and having a mix of inpatient and outpatient time, derm is missing this in terms of inpatient time and team rooms of co-residents.

\- Peds: Old people sometimes make me sad and are smelly. My FAVORITE age group is truly like 15-35. Which is why I could do adolescent medicine and enjoy the psych and peds part of it. I could see myself doing like peds cards too or something fun like that to work with perinatal moms. But peds is also like a bucket option. I really liked my peds rotation and felt like for the most part it was super pleasant (we even had 2 deaths while I was there and went to one of the my patient's celebration of life, and found that that was also super meaningful to help the parents through some of the worst times of their life, it was very touching and very moving). I came into medical school thinking peds and have always gravitated towards working with children. I prefer them a bit older, but babies are also so cute. Again, I really enjoy the team aspect and working in the team room, bonding with co-residents and having a mix of inpatient and outpatient time, derm is missing this in terms of inpatient time and team rooms of co-residents. However, the low salary has me wondering if 40 year old me will kick myself when I had the resources to apply derm.

\- PM&R: I had an injury for years that was helped only by PM&R and ortho and years of PT. I shadowed PM&R for sports medicine and also general PM&R and really enjoyed my time. I am very interested in sports and mobility (and alllllll of my hobbies are sports and running and working out) so I like the work of it. Additionally, I like the tiny procedures like injections and needling and the patient follow-up. But again with higher scores and coming from a top school, I don't know if I should aim somewhere else. I just go to clinic and im like oh this is cool I could do this, the same way I feel about derm kinda.

\- Psych: so this was my first clinical rotation coming from pre-clinical years and it was on eating disorders. I really liked it it was tied for my favorite rotation. I loved the age range of younger adults and talking with patients and counseling them. I LOVED eating disorders. But since I spent my entire time there, I am worried that I did not get a full inpatient psych experience. However, my rotation in the psych ED was strange of course and a bit scary, and I found that psych outpatient also went by a little slower than derm clinic (because I would look at the clock wondering when the appointment time was over). I am also worried about the safety aspect and the same thing about derm as not feeling like a real doc to others (even though I know mental health is important, but also life circumstances determine like 90% of someone's mental wellbeing, so I don't know if I'llalways feel job satisfaction if my patients don't respond to treatments. And I feel sad about losing other clinical knowledge I had and never using my stethoscope. But the lifestyle is wonderful and all my friends had an intervention with me telling me to do psych because they always say that im the easiest person to talk to and always ask the right questions. my psych evals were also wonderful and everyone was saying I was so good at it. I genuinely enjoy talking with others so much, I am a huge extrovert, and I loved my psych rotation. It felt light and easy (not sure if it;s just eating disorders though) and I enjoyed going everyday. But, again I'm not sure if like derm this was just a med-student-friendly rotation. It also seems like the lifestyle and not working crazy hard also suits me.

I would really appreciate any insights or thoughts you all have. Thank you SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME!!!!! and let me know if you think dual applying is the answer.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1jdsp9y/help_picking_a_specialty/

1f5ll4z,This is what you are fighting for,"Working as a programmer these days is so stressful and stubborn, especially on low positions, and you guys can't even get breadcrumbs, which are interviews for internships. The market is oversaturated with candidates, and companies are expecting more and more for less pay. It feels like no matter how hard you work or how much you learn, you're just another cog in the machine, easily replaceable and undervalued.

And let's not even talk about the constant pressure to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. It's like you're on a never-ending treadmill, running to keep up, but never really getting anywhere. The burnout rate is through the roof, and it's no wonder so many talented developers are leaving the field altogether.

qww03i,"Calculus Professor just assigned 8 hours of lecture, and 32 quizzes over Thanksgiving break‚Ä¶ Please help.","I wish I was making this up‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm a Freshman in Calc 2 and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his ‚Äúincredible math skills‚Äù he‚Äôs super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning 4 chapters over break, each chapter containing 4 30-minute lecture videos, accompanied by a 30 minute timed quiz for each video. He‚Äôs just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. 

We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November 29th (the day we get back) So he‚Äôs basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these 4 chapters is also the day we get back from break.

So I‚Äôm wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I‚Äôm so stressed out and now I won‚Äôt even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!


Update: 

Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. 

I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only 16 20-minute quizzes, not 32 as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of 4 chapters, each with 4 videos and a quiz after each video.

It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it‚Äôs still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. 

If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus 2 in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his ‚Äúteaching strategy.‚Äù

1l841sz,It's Okay To Take A Break and It's Okay To Not Be Perfect,"The other day, I posted on here where I received replies that made me realize that perhaps I am experiencing burnout, and how being a perfectionist is really hurting me. Today at the library, walking towards the coffee shop, I coincidentally turned my  head and, *voila!*, I saw this book on the shelf, ""Embrace Your Almost"" by Jordan Lee Dooley. I have only read a few pages and her words resonated with me. I feel like the universe called out to me and said ""Woman! Read this!"" Lol... I hold myself to ridiculously high standards, typically setting myself up for failure, simply because the expectations are just unattainable. I had this crazy idea.
I set out to get a 100% in grad school. This is ridiculous because I'm admittedly  nowhere near the smartest person, and some projects and assignments are graded subjectively.

Anyway... This is a reminder to be content and appreciate your wins and accomplishments. 

""It's about finding clarity and contentment- even in the middle of those almost-but-not-quite-achieved dreams and making the most of the unknowns and in-betweens. 

Why? 

Because if we live only for the mountaintop moments-the huge, obvious wins, we'll miss out on the refining that happens in the valleys and on the journey. When we're hidden, when nobody sees our efforts, when we work for what seems like forever only to almost achieve our goal? That's the tension we'll spend a lot of our lives in.""

1mbof4x,Is doing an internship at the same time as my first semester a stupid thing to do?,"So, I'm starting college as a freshman this fall. Thinking about starting college has made me think even more about the career I hope to have and how much I want it. So I've been impatient to get ahead in work experience, and with some searching I found a remote internship for 10 hours a week. The length of the internship would be this September through December. I've decided to apply even though I doubt I'll get it, because, why not? But on the off chance that I do get accepted - would it be absolutely stupid to be doing an internship at the same time that I'm settling in/getting used to college? I'm not worried about the respective time commitments per se, since it's the same as if I got a part time job, which I already hoped to do... more so the potential for overwhelm and burnout. It'd be a lot of writing, thinking, and computer work, more so than I'd already have. Plus I've never moved before, so just being in a new place will be a big adjustment. And yet I'd really love to do the internship if possible, it's exactly the kind of thing I want to pursue.

1k39kit,CMU SCS vs Harvard,"Hey everyone,  
I've seen a few post related to choosing between CMU SCS and Harvard but I wanted to ask about my specific case since I'm stuck.

I was pretty dead set on choosing CMU SCS, specifically its intensity and being filled with insanely smart peers who would push me to do better and excel in CS.

But recently, I landed an FAANG internship. Knowing this, my parents and everyone around me have been pushing me to go to Harvard because

1. I already have a big internship under my belt, so ""I don‚Äôt need CMU's rigor to land jobs""
2. Harvard‚Äôs prestige would open more long-term doors since they're convinced I'll be replaced by AI  or lose my future job
3. I could still take tough technical courses at MIT through cross-registration
4. I would be less stressed (?)

I'm not a big fan of Harvard's CS classes and prefer CMU's. However, I feel that if I choose CMU, everyone around me would be really disappointed. 

I visited both campuses and I liked both, which didn't really help me in deciding. Money isn't a problem for either school.

Any advice from anyone? Super conflicted. Thank you so much!",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1k39kit/cmu_scs_vs_harvard/
1ki2dq2,Not feeling supported in my counseling program,"I just wrapped up my first year in grad school as a clinical counseling major. Im struggling with imposter syndrome and feeling unsupported by professors and advisors In my program. Last semester I had a professor make fun of me in front of class during a roleplay because I was leaning forward. My professor told me that leaning forward could make someone uncomfortable. As well as then telling the class that she would never personally see a male therapist. In my other class I had to write a paper on a journal article that discussed a specific mental health condition. My professor misinterpreted what I had wrote in my paper and became upset with me. He accused me of saying people with a specific mental health condition never experienced trauma. Which is not what I wrote. When I told him that wasn't what I wrote she said I was still wrong and I should have wrote it better then. He also told me that having a full time job on top of grad school is almost impossible to manage and succeed in. 
This past semester I had another professor who doesn't communicate at all about what he wants in papers and is very strict on APA and grammar. He also gives incorrect information about APA and refuses to acknowledge when he is wrong. I had another professor who was teaching one my online classes but she never and never taught the class. She uploaded PowerPoints from the book publisher. Told us what our assignments were and that was it. She never gave feedback on discussion boards and papers. When I tell my advisor who is also a professor in the program, he told me that their is nothing he can do. He told me to complain to fill out the course evaluation form and put the issues I had with each class In them. I don't feel like I am being set up for success In this program. I feel like I'm being bullied by my professors. Those who are in a clinical mental health grad program, is this normal? Do you feel supported in your program? What does the support look like in your program?",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ki2dq2/not_feeling_supported_in_my_counseling_program/
1grco9v,"I quit PhD today, and give up scholarship","Until now I still do not know if this is the right thing to do, but I listened to the voice in my mind and made the decision.

My background is a bit complicated. I am a phd student in the humanities in the 2nd year. I am from Asia and was admitted to a European university last year. For financial reasons, my PI and I agreed that I can defer one year before officially starting my studies. So I used the time to apply for funding and scholarship. Unfortunately, for the largest funding I was rejected in the final round; however, I was able to secure a scholarship from another source. But somehow this was not enough for me (not precisely financially but more psychologically).

During this one-year period, I kept doubting myself, about the studies and the future after that. I found out that I cannot bear the fact that I need to severely twist my topic to fit the academic ""fad"" (in my home country) so that a funding can become possible. The doctoral project I am looking at right now does not click as it did a year ago. And I cannot help thinking this ""twisting and fitting"" will definitely still be the case if I could graduate and work in academia. So I have been experiencing something I cannot quite describe (burnout? depression? imposter syndrome? maybe pride? or a mixture of all).

I totally understand that MA and PhD are completely different things. But in my MA years, I can spend more than 12 hours, everyday, in library, for 3 years, just to read and learn and write. I eventually generated a 250-page dissertation, reviewed by committee as almost ""PhD-level,"" and won a state-level diss. award. But now, I just feel disgusted and ashamed of my doctoral project. I do not even want to start it and feel that it will be a failure anyway. It is just amazing that how much I have changed. Maybe it is just that I cannot bear the fact that I can be so against the subject I loved once. And that thought kept developing into an action‚Äî""it's time to leave PhD.""

Anyway, I quitted today, informed my PI of the news, gave up scholarship, canceled housing booking and visa, everything. Maybe it is time for me to realize that I am not cut out for PhD and academia, professionally and psychologically. Sorry for the venting. But the lesson I learned from this experience is that we have to cherish our passion (I assume after graduation it will become even more important). It used to be one of my greatest strength to push forward, but I somehow lost it on the way. Just be grateful that we are able to love the things we love.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1grco9v/i_quit_phd_today_and_give_up_scholarship/
m0894c,Going through med school poor was hard,"Not just med school, but all of life up to and including med school.

I have been financially independent since as long as I can remember, maybe middle school. My parents have never given me more than $20 total in my lifetime. I'm a woman and the bullying from having to wear my male cousins hand me down clothes was rough.

I've taken out loans for both tuition and living for undergrad and med school. Before med school, I paid for my grad degree by working full-time (was salaried and ended up being more like 70 hours per week).

I acquired a lot of chronic health issues from working so much and then doing grad school part-time.

Living loans barely cover the ""true"" cost of living, except I don't have anyone I can turn to in an emergency. I cannot ask my parents or siblings for financial help. I feel the stress of this daily.

For example, unexpected health bills. I have a ton of health bills currently in collections and my dad sends me a text message photo of the collections bills coming in. There's not anything that either of us can do about these bills though.

I worked full time for years just to be able to save up for MCAT and application fees, however my full-time research job paid peanuts and I was never able to save up any money.

So I took out a 10k loan to cover app costs (applied broadly MD and DO, including travel costs).

I don't quality for any URM or merit scholarships. I am proud of my grades, but they are quite average because I have a lot of paid side jobs which cut into my studying and overall stress level/quality of life.

I was excited to come across the #medgradwishlist trend on Twitter, I was hoping to find what I needed for residency free on local buy nothing groups but realized this could help supplement. But I then realized it's geared towards URM's, and I am white.

I absolutely realize the privilege I have with my skin color but I've just felt so lost in med school. I have a lot of friends but it's difficult to connect on more than a surface level with all of my wealthy classmates that come from double doctor families. People see my skin color and assume I am part of this group of students and I feel like we are from different planets.

And then the med school friends I do have end up dropping me when they realize that 1.) I'm too poor to have a car so I can't meet them at X place to hang out or 2.) I can't have our social events be weekly expensive takeout food, I just can't afford it.

I'll probably delete this later because it feels too vulnerable and I'd get stressed if there's any mean comments.

Idk, I'm graduating med school soon and there's no one I've been able to speak with about this before because there's no one at my school that has had a similar experience.

&#x200B;

*Edit: Thank you for seeing me. If your life experience has been similar, I see you too. I appreciate each and every comment and message.*

*Edit 2 (because someone said that Twitter screenshotted my post to double down on #medgradwishlist being for URM only): Okay, cool. All I said in my post was that I simply wasn't ""eligible"" to post a wishlist under this hashtag. I didn't say nor imply that I didn't agree with this, etc. The students are deserving and I support this initiative.* ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/m0894c/going_through_med_school_poor_was_hard/
1f96jqc,I made a massive mistake. ,"Okay, so I think I made a HUGE mistake in my first week of college. On my first day, everything went well, but i got terrified at the amount of homework we had to do, not knowing that it was that much work I would have to complete and the second day I went to my first class and got assigned even more homework and started spiraling. I thought I couldn‚Äôt do it, that I wasn‚Äôt smart enough, or didn‚Äôt have the motivation, so I went to the advisor and decided to try and drop out but basically no one was available to talk to me about enrolling all day, and since I was so set on unrolling all day, I missed my other two classes. I know, VERY stupid. I thought about it more and more, realizing if I care a lot about my work, I won‚Äôt loose that motivation, I just don‚Äôt have the study skills necessary to properly study for my classes. So, I talked with my mom more, and realized maybe dropping out isn‚Äôt a good idea when I haven‚Äôt even seen any of the other classes yet, and knowing I was spiraling into thinking I wasn‚Äôt smart enough for this program when there are so many supports that will help me become a better student and a better studier. How do I explain to my teachers that I freaked out on the second day and to let me apologize for missing the first day of classes?? I‚Äôm freaking out right now and I think I might have to drop out, especially if I already missed those classes and I‚Äôm terrified that the teachers already hate me and think i‚Äôm a bad student for already skipping the first day.

1iwwxm7,Make Sure You Are Going to School for the Right Reasons,"I just want to start off by saying, I am very grateful that I have had the opportunity to work at a master‚Äôs degree and am proud to be graduating in the spring with it. I also recognize that I am very lucky in the fact that I was able to get it majorly funded through becoming a TA and recognize that I am very lucky to have gotten the ability to not only go to grad school but go for what will be a little under $3000 for the entirety of my master‚Äôs program, especially when looking at how things are going with the current administration and so much being up in the air when it comes to funding and such here in the United States.

With all that being said, I just want to caution you if you are thinking about attending and why you want to attend. I will fully admit, I do not think I did start my MA for the correct reasons. I will fully admit, I started because I felt it could allow for me to get paid more adequately in the job market, and I was at a job that I was not particularly passionate about. And now I feel like I am the same place as I was two years ago. I often regret my choice to go to school, but I am in no way not going to complete it, I am here for essentially three more months, it would be stupid not to. I joke about how I will never actually use my master‚Äôs (which I know rationally isn‚Äôt true). I am working on not being upset with my past self and moving forward, and ultimately, while I may not think I have gone for the correct reasons, I am proud of the fact that I currently have a 4.0 GPA in a program and field that I personally hate, again, not the program or field‚Äôs fault, just not something I particularly care about in the slightest. Maybe it‚Äôs burnout, maybe it‚Äôs just self frustration because I am going in a different direction in my life. I am unsure.

What I will say, really do yourself a favor and look into why you want to go to grad school. Do you feel like you are unsure where you are going in life? Maybe avoid going until you are confident in what you are thinking about in that regard. It is a commitment, and I really only recommend going if this is something you absolutely love and are passionate about. Grad school can be an extremely rewarding experience and one that can really advance you in life- but only if it is something you really want to pursue. And also look into if you really want to engage in academia. It is definitely different than undergrad, there is tons of research involved, much more reading, and can be extremely time consuming.¬†

This isn‚Äôt meant to ward anyone away from joining a grad program! I have met some wonderful friends in my program who absolutely love everything we do within the program. Even though I have some regrets, I have ultimately leaned more on the side that I am glad I went. I just wanted to give my experience and thoughts, and sort of maybe lay everything out there. Good luck to everyone!

1caum99,The unexpected disappointments of 4th Year. ,"Fourth year is one of the more bittersweet experiences of my life. Maybe that‚Äôs a blessing that I haven‚Äôt had worse, but it was truly an unexpected disappointment. I‚Äôve officially finished my final rotation, the evaluation is submitted and all that‚Äôs required is graduation. You‚Äôd think this accomplishment would induce a feeling of freedom - relief, joy, awe, even. Instead it feels like imposter syndrome, as the last 4 months have felt like I‚Äôve been crawling through quicksand to this finish line. It wasn‚Äôt pretty. I didn‚Äôt show up as my best self to every rotation, even got my first ‚ÄúBelow Expectations‚Äù in a category and that was an absolute blow to the ego. 

Things I expected to bring joy but brought an overwhelming sense of inadequacy: 

- Spending thousands at audition rotations across the country at programs and cities that excited me, to find out the residency program and fellow trainers weren‚Äôt your people and the experience felt off

- Getting my second choice residency in a ‚Äúeasy‚Äù speciality, feeling confused that my first choice led me to believe I was ranked to match and then never hearing from them again. Feeling guilty that my first reaction was disappointment in not getting my first choice. 

- Reading my last evaluation on my final day of medical school to see they wrote that I ‚Äúdefinitely had senioritis‚Äù and had more areas to improve on than praises

An incomplete list of the many experiences that I expected to bring joy, but just made me feel even less motivated. 4th year isn‚Äôt a walk in the park and looking back on all my time, I feel like I‚Äôve been trying to run through water that turned to quicksand with the occasional wave that knocks you over, while everyone is watching around you on solid ground expecting you to be so proud of yourself but really you just feel like you‚Äôre not moving fast enough.
