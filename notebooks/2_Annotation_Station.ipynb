      "---------------------------------\n",
      "BODY:\\nAlthough this is my 4th semester, I am still new to all this. Over the past couple years, my class size has increased. This semester I have about 165 students in my largest class. One thing that I have learned is that students love to wait til the end of the semester to share life’s circumstances. I understand trying to push through it, but I have asked them to let me know when things happen instead waiting til the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their semester paper was posted in the syllabus with the due date. I told them over a month ago that they should be working on it. This is a huge assignment and requires me and my teaching assistants to devote a lot of time to it on top of catching up on grading other things. The long emails about “can we meet to discuss this?” From folks with multiple missing assignments or no assignments turned in at all are rolling in and I am already exhausted. \n",
      "\n",
      "One student even accused me of something that I didn’t do in order to get an extension. Of course I defended myself but I just gave in for the extension. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I was not feeling well the day it was due. Oh I was out of town the day it was due. Sigh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like most of us, I have in my syllabus that doctors notes are a valid excuse. But the, “I have been sick all semester”, or “My grandpa has been sick since January and it’s taken a toll on me all semester” or “I have been sick several times this semester, here’s my collection of doctors notes now allow me to make up everything even though grades are due next week”. All of these things are very valid BUT why didn’t you tell me this early on? The big issue for me is timing. I’m grateful for the students who send me an email several days before the assignment is due to tell me it’s a bad mental health week, I need more time. Sure! No problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I handle this with care and boundaries for myself? How do YOU handle this time of the semester when the excuses start rolling in? I don’t care about being “liked” but I do want to be careful and considerate. The longer I’m in this profession the harder it’s getting to brave this time of the semester 😩\n",

      "---------------------------------\n",
      "BODY:\\n’m not against becoming a doctor, but I want to make sure I keep all my options open. I’ve just entered my clinical years, and I’m already feeling somewhat burned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, I’m on a neurology inpatient rotation, and I really enjoy it. We’re typically done around 2 PM and get close to an hour for lunch. My resident gives me the chance to see a patient on my own and then I present to the attending. It honestly reminds me of the show *Suits*—that back-and-forth professional dynamic—and I really like that aspect of medicine. Can't wait to do that with a different rotation. It like trying a different flavor in an ice cream shop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I recognize I’m seeing a “highlight reel” of the profession. I don’t fully know what my attending is doing behind closed doors—charting, admin work, insurance battles, or other responsibilities that aren't visible to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before this, I was on a neurosurgery rotation, and it was a completely different experience. I was waking up at 4 AM and working until 3 PM with no actual lunch breaks—just a granola bar to get me through. On the plus side, I lost some weight, but I knew almost immediately that neurosurgery wasn’t for me. The lifestyle was too extreme and not aligned with what I want long-term. And they were being generous to me because they worked until 7 pm daily. And they had on call for 2 weekends in a roll. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I do know is that I value balance**.** I want a career where I can have time for hobbies like rock climbing and working out. I also want to be present for my future family—to attend my kids' basketball games, not just provide financially but be *there*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before choosing medicine, I considered engineering, but that also comes with challenges—long hours, fear of layoffs, and navigating corporate politics. I actually worked at a science research company before med school. It was a standard 9–5 job, paid around $60K, and the work was simple. But there was zero upward mobility—most people quit after six months because the job involved nothing more than spinning blood samples. That lack of growth and stimulation pushed me toward medicine.\n",

      "So here’s where I’m at:\n",

      "I'm in third year, enjoying aspects of clinical rotations, but also already feeling the weight of the path ahead. I’m aware that medicine can be rewarding, but I also don’t want to blindly follow a path that could lead to burnout or resentment. I want to stay open-minded.\n",
      "\n",
      "**My questions are:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* What career paths can someone take with an MD besides traditional clinical practice?\n",
      "* Does my reasoning for keeping my options open make sense, or am I just overwhelmed by the transition into clinical training?\n",
