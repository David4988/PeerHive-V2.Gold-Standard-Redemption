1k8udoi,End of the semester: How much empathy can one give?,"Although this is my 4th semester, I am still new to all this. Over the past couple years, my class size has increased. This semester I have about 165 students in my largest class. One thing that I have learned is that students love to wait til the end of the semester to share life‚Äôs circumstances. I understand trying to push through it, but I have asked them to let me know when things happen instead waiting til the end.

Their semester paper was posted in the syllabus with the due date. I told them over a month ago that they should be working on it. This is a huge assignment and requires me and my teaching assistants to devote a lot of time to it on top of catching up on grading other things. The long emails about ‚Äúcan we meet to discuss this?‚Äù From folks with multiple missing assignments or no assignments turned in at all are rolling in and I am already exhausted. 

One student even accused me of something that I didn‚Äôt do in order to get an extension. Of course I defended myself but I just gave in for the extension. 

Oh I was not feeling well the day it was due. Oh I was out of town the day it was due. Sigh. 

Like most of us, I have in my syllabus that doctors notes are a valid excuse. But the, ‚ÄúI have been sick all semester‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMy grandpa has been sick since January and it‚Äôs taken a toll on me all semester‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have been sick several times this semester, here‚Äôs my collection of doctors notes now allow me to make up everything even though grades are due next week‚Äù. All of these things are very valid BUT why didn‚Äôt you tell me this early on? The big issue for me is timing. I‚Äôm grateful for the students who send me an email several days before the assignment is due to tell me it‚Äôs a bad mental health week, I need more time. Sure! No problem. 

How do I handle this with care and boundaries for myself? How do YOU handle this time of the semester when the excuses start rolling in? I don‚Äôt care about being ‚Äúliked‚Äù but I do want to be careful and considerate. The longer I‚Äôm in this profession the harder it‚Äôs getting to brave this time of the semester üò©",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1k8udoi/end_of_the_semester_how_much_empathy_can_one_give/,1
1lhwct6,What are other careers for medicine that you can do other than being a traditional doctor?,"‚Äôm not against becoming a doctor, but I want to make sure I keep all my options open. I‚Äôve just entered my clinical years, and I‚Äôm already feeling somewhat burned out.

Currently, I‚Äôm on a neurology inpatient rotation, and I really enjoy it. We‚Äôre typically done around 2 PM and get close to an hour for lunch. My resident gives me the chance to see a patient on my own and then I present to the attending. It honestly reminds me of the show *Suits*‚Äîthat back-and-forth professional dynamic‚Äîand I really like that aspect of medicine. Can't wait to do that with a different rotation. It like trying a different flavor in an ice cream shop. 

Still, I recognize I‚Äôm seeing a ‚Äúhighlight reel‚Äù of the profession. I don‚Äôt fully know what my attending is doing behind closed doors‚Äîcharting, admin work, insurance battles, or other responsibilities that aren't visible to me.

Before this, I was on a neurosurgery rotation, and it was a completely different experience. I was waking up at 4 AM and working until 3 PM with no actual lunch breaks‚Äîjust a granola bar to get me through. On the plus side, I lost some weight, but I knew almost immediately that neurosurgery wasn‚Äôt for me. The lifestyle was too extreme and not aligned with what I want long-term. And they were being generous to me because they worked until 7 pm daily. And they had on call for 2 weekends in a roll. 

What I do know is that I value balance**.** I want a career where I can have time for hobbies like rock climbing and working out. I also want to be present for my future family‚Äîto attend my kids' basketball games, not just provide financially but be *there*.

Before choosing medicine, I considered engineering, but that also comes with challenges‚Äîlong hours, fear of layoffs, and navigating corporate politics. I actually worked at a science research company before med school. It was a standard 9‚Äì5 job, paid around $60K, and the work was simple. But there was zero upward mobility‚Äîmost people quit after six months because the job involved nothing more than spinning blood samples. That lack of growth and stimulation pushed me toward medicine.

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at:

I'm in third year, enjoying aspects of clinical rotations, but also already feeling the weight of the path ahead. I‚Äôm aware that medicine can be rewarding, but I also don‚Äôt want to blindly follow a path that could lead to burnout or resentment. I want to stay open-minded.

**My questions are:**

* What career paths can someone take with an MD besides traditional clinical practice?
* Does my reasoning for keeping my options open make sense, or am I just overwhelmed by the transition into clinical training?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lhwct6/what_are_other_careers_for_medicine_that_you_can/,0

jj62q6,"Pro tip for those 11th hour ""student has a 13%, has done nothing all semester, and asks if they can do makeup work"" emails","I used to get these emails and I would spend countless hours jumping through hoops to help students by creating alternative assignments (since the answers were often already out there by this point) and most of the time they don't do it anyway. Or at least not enough to make a real dent in anything. Or I know the student won't actually do it and have said no and then wind up having to go meet with my Chair after the student complains and gives some type of sob story (some which may actually be valid but that doesn't mean the student is going to actually do the work). I'm always happy to go above and beyond to help a student who is actually willing to do the work but 99 times out of 100, if they haven't done the work all semester, they aren't going to start now. So I have started doing the following and I swear by this... I have had so much less drama. So here's my go-to...

I say yes **but** under the following conditions:

1. Student must have a meeting (virtually now) with an academic support coach to address the issues regarding why they are having trouble keeping up with their academic work. I then need 2 paragraphs sharing a specific plan for what they plan to do differently going forward and how they are going to implement that. 
2. I need a written plan for specific due dates of when they plan to turn in each item that I need to agree to before moving forward. (I wouldn't say no to anything other than ""turn everything in the last day of class"" ... I don't have time for that kind of grading at that point). 

If they meet the above criteria, student may get 70% credit for any item that they turn in on the dates that we agreed to (speeches and exams are an exception... they can't get back credit for those). 

Best case: they have a chance to reevaluate why they are struggling and make a plan for themselves going forward and can get back on track  
Worst case: they do nothing and I didn't waste a ton of time 

Do you know how many students have actually taken me up on this? One. In my entire teaching career. And I was actually really glad she did... she was a fall athlete in her first semester of college who was just drowning. She had been an honors student in high school but was taking far too many classes, in a major that was a horrible fit for her (her parents were pushing her to do it), and just overall overwhelmed trying to balance school and a crazy schedule. She had a 'come to Jesus' moment at the end of that semester and even sat out a few games to catch up. I just wrote her recommendation for grad school (without a single reservation... she really turned it around). 

I have a standard email that I copy and paste every time I get one of these with the above stipulations and it's saved me hours and hours and hours of headaches.

1jdvr2z,Kinda thinking of ditching trucking to get a bachelor‚Äôs degree,"For some context, I didn‚Äôt really try in high school lol. I ended up with a 2.47 GPA and got a 19 on the ACT. I‚Äôm also currently 23, so I graduated HS in 2020. Never once brought work home from school from middle school and beyond lol. I think I could‚Äôve done much better, I never necessarily struggled with my work, it was more so of a not paying attention, not taking notes, sleeping in class, being stoned out of my found issue. 

As an adult my life has changed a lot, I won‚Äôt go to far into it but I had some pretty severe mental health issues as a teenager which led to me do self destructive things. For some reason entering adulthood my outlook on life took a complete 180, especially after moving out of my parent‚Äôs house, moving from Wisconsin to Southern California, finding some actual success in life and realizing how good it can feel. 

At the moment I‚Äôm a class A truck driver, I actually enjoy doing it too but I think I‚Äôm capable of more. I also think that driving all day long and not really working aside people takes a major toll on me, I feel like I never have time for anything and I‚Äôm constantly exhausted. I make $28 an hour with just shy of 2 years of experience and my job isn‚Äôt over the road, it‚Äôs a local gig out of Irwindale, CA making residential building material deliveries around the greater Los Angeles area. On the other hand I have a friend who I went to CDL school with that has an MBA and absolutely hated his job as a project manager and got into trucking.

18m596i,Considering to quit PhD after 4years,"As the title says, I'm considering to quit my PhD after around 4 years and would be happy to hear your thoughts on my situation. And apologies in advance, I have written for hours on this post and it has already become quite long, even though I have tried to shorten it again. I hope it's still somewhat coherent. If anybody of you takes the time to read it, thank you very much, you are awesome! :)  


**TLDR:** I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University (i.e. I have already earned my Masters degree 4 years ago) with 2 more years until the final deadline. I have worked for 2-3 years on a project, which I abandoned 10months ago without proper results as it didn't work out. Afterwards, I have started a new project, but again find myself in a bad place and worried about my mental health. My supervisor has been and is completely unsupportive. Now, I'm torn between trying to push on and quitting. I am worried that in the first case I'll further ruin my mental health, in the second case I'm worried about regretting the decision later and experiencing it as failure possibly also making me unhappy.  


**Some basic information about me and my PhD program**  
I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University. As it is typical in Germany, I have already earned my Masters degree before the PhD. I am 29 years old. I have a position that, with around 48k, is an uncommonly well payed position. Funding is available for 2 more years. I am also accepted as a PhD student at the University for 2 more years, a significant extension beyond this is unlikely. In the first year I (and my supervisor) didn't have any idea for a research topic and at the same time I was TA for one of the big Mathematics lectures. Nevertheless, I gradually managed to work out a project and start working on it. For the following 2-2.5 years I have worked on this project. About 10 months ago I quit the previous project as it didn't work out and switched to a new project, which is only vaguely connected to the old one. Since then, I have no teaching obligations anymore.  


**The problems/reasons why I consider to quit**  
The problems basically fall into three categories.  
*i) Related to my well being/mental health:* This is the most important aspect for me. For most of the previous project I have felt continuously unhappy at work. The topic change has given me a motivation boost, but this has worn off again by now. Instead, I now find myself in a situation, where I am unable to even properly focus on my work anymore (even though it's actually not that complicated right now), have repeatedly sleep problems, frequently feel completely drained and/or sad after being at work and occasionally am even unable to motivate myself for activities outside of work. Fortunately, the issues mostly pass once I have a few days off from work, but still I have the fear that they might become persistent if I push through it even longer. Moreover, my self-confidence has completely vanished over the years in my PhD. Even though I try to not attach it to the progress in my PhD, my self-esteem has suffered significantly, too.  Finally, I don't feel like I have the energy to do all the things I still need to do if I want to finish my PhD.   
*ii) Related to my progress:* I have worked for between 2 and 3 years on the previous project. However, the only outcome of this project is a ""proof"" which relies on an assumption whose validity cannot be established by the current state of the research in the field and which we therefore never tried to publish. My supervisor has never given me a proper Yes or No whether he would be fine if I include it in my dissertation, even though I have asked/discussed it multiple times. In the new project, I have made some progress that, however, is only of interest for our industrial partner in the project, but does not involve any Mathematical progress and that I cannot include in my dissertation due to the NDA with the industrial partner. I have started working on some minor Mathematical contributions but are stuck, see also i). As a consequence, I have no results at all so far that I can include in my dissertation. Obviously, I have not submitted any papers or given any talks anywhere as a consequence.  
*iii) Related to my supervisor:* My supervisor has been and continues to be completely unsupportive. To be precise, he does not reply to mails, is absent most of the time, is unable to provide both strategical and mathematical advice and does not provide feedback even if explicitly asked to do so. So far it has especially been almost impossible to discuss the problems I had in my PhD so far with him. The perfect example for our relationship is the situation where I wanted to discuss the option of taking a break from my PhD for an internship outside of academia. As he was again absent for a while, I have sent him an email in which I roughly outlined the topic and asked for a meeting. He then ignored my email (and a follow-up one) for several weeks, and when I accidentally stumbled upon him at work, he told me, in (without exaggeration) just about 30 seconds, that he is against it and that he now has to attend a meeting. Afterwards, there haven't been any further discussion about it.  


**Why I have started and so far continued the PhD**  
Originally, I have started my PhD probably for some of the worst reasons possible. Up until my PhD, I have been a rather good student even finishing my Masters with the best possible grade. And, I'm not gonna lie, at that point I had based a lot of my self esteem on this fact/on seeing me as an intelligent person which is able to handle most intellectual challenges. In that sense, doing a PhD seemed as the next logical step to prove this view of myself to myself. Moreover, it was convenient as my supervisor offered me the position at the University I was already at with an uncommonly good salary of around 48000‚Ç¨. A former professor who just retired when I started my PhD and who was very renowned in the field that I am working now additionally promised me that he will help me to organize research stays at other interesting Universities. Of course, I was also somewhat excited about the research area, even though it now feels like I have never had a really deep interest in it.   
What then kept me in my PhD at all the multiple times where I thought about quitting, is that I really enjoy teaching and would like to increase my chances of doing University/College level teaching later on, that I can't help but see quitting as a failure of myself and an increasingly strong sunk cost fallacy. Recently, also the fear that quitting a PhD after such a long time might give possible future employees the impression that I am not a competent Mathematician, that I am not perseverant and that I am not able to make the right decision at the right time has added to that. 

**My options and how I look at them**

*i) Continue to push through my PhD for 2 more years:* If I find a way to focus again at work and possibly make progress on some of the topics I am stuck at, I could imagine that this scenario works out. However, I am seriously worried that nevertheless the mental health issues I am already encountering become even more severe and constant along the way and that the joy/pride of pushing through is not even remotely compensating this anymore.  
*ii) Apply for a new job:* If my current job was a ""normal"" job, i.e. not possibly rewarded with a PhD, I am almost certain that I would have changed jobs already. And I can imagine that I might be happier in another job (after a while). However, I can also very well imagine that the feeling of failure together with the thoughts about ""what if I had finished it"" might be so powerful that I also end up really unhappy in this scenario. And I have noticed that, whenever I seriously picture me leaving the PhD behind, I get a very strong and dreadful feeling of actually deserving a PhD and having being cheated out of the possibility that keeps me from accepting this scenario. Of course, I am well aware that this is a weird, bad and unjustified sense of entitlement - Mark Manson sens his regards. I think this comes from the fact that friends of mine that are probably not significantly better researchers are about to finish.

1mkaph7,85% of writing done,"68k words of around 80k completed. Humanities thesis in Australia.

State of play
- Have submitted 4 of 6 substantive chapters (2x analytical chapters, methodology, and periodisation chapters) to supervisors. Only minor revisions suggested to each.
- Only probably 2-3k words left each in the last analytical chapter and theoretical framework chapters.
- Then have to write intro and conclusion.
- Also need to format all of my references which is going to be a right nightmare as I just dumped in links to articles or books, or random notes (referencing as I go breaks up my writing workflow).

1jr3dk9,Dropping out of college,"
26F, CS major. 

Basically I come from an immigrant family who expected far too much from me. I had no ‚Äúdream career‚Äù and no interest in doing anything. All these years I‚Äôve literally been bullshiting my way to this point, it somehow worked out through high school and through my first few years in community college but this is as far as I‚Äôm getting. It all came at the cost of my mental health. Looking back I never really had a healthy mental state but with college I can certainly say it‚Äôs brought it down to rock bottom. I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed but I‚Äôm fairly certainly I have undiagnosed ADHD, bipolar disorder or depression.  Everyday was a fight. It‚Äôs fucked me up so much. Ive taken so many gap years, gone through a few major changes and got dismissed twice already and I‚Äôm about to be dismissed for the third. 

Apparently appeals after the third dismissal are typically denied and that‚Äôs understandable. Though there is one last option I have which is a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù program that I believe all colleges offer(?) but I‚Äôd have to wait for 3 years to reapply (and it‚Äôs only a small selected number of students) but quite honestly I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll even want to by then. I legitimately believe I‚Äôve been traumatized, everything related to school just makes me miserable and scared. I can‚Äôt even look at a classroom without a chill running down my spine. And anyways, by that time I‚Äôll be nearing 30 and the thought of that alone makes me want to end it all. My whole life wasted on nothing. Straight up a failure. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. I feel pathetic, guilty, lost and i don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm stupid but I definitely FEEL stupid. Point is I don‚Äôt have much of a choice now than to drop out. I could try to appeal again but if, and that‚Äôs a big IF I got readmitted, honestly I still don‚Äôt have the motivation. I have around 13-15 more classes to take to graduate but I just don‚Äôt have it in me to thug it out and try to finish them anymore. It‚Äôd be a stupid waste of money and time. 
Thinking about dropping out sounds freeing though. Almost makes me feel happy. I don‚Äôt mind it. As corny as this might sound i feel like I‚Äôve been shackled my whole damn life and this is the one time I feel good about doing something but at the same time it‚Äôs terrifying. I keep having second thoughts‚Ä¶. Like what happens next ? What direction will I be going in life ? What options do i have ? Not to mention the biggest issue is that I can‚Äôt handle everyone‚Äôs disappointment. It‚Äôs too heavy for me.

1ldyr13,"I Don‚Äôt Want to Reward Students for Pestering, Just Me?","Student emails me at 9pm last night with a question (about an assignment students almost never have questions about because I‚Äôve been teaching it this way for years). 

Student sends a follow up at noon today (with the rationale that they feel overwhelmed if they don‚Äôt have all the details).

I now feel caught between two meh options. I don‚Äôt want to respond right away because I feel like this rewards bad behavior, but I also don‚Äôt want to wait too long because it is my job to reply, etc. and I do actually want to help.

So now I‚Äôm trying to figure out when I would have replied if the student had not sent this follow up. 

Anyone else get this? Anyone else tempted to sit on emails for a minute to help students learn reasonable expectations for response times and to develop some skills for handling their feelings around short delays? 

Edit update:
Thanks all! I replied. I also let the student know that per the syllabus, they shouldn‚Äôt follow up on emails for at least 2 business days‚Äî and that in their future job, they should allow a full 3-5 BDs. 

I heard some great suggestions‚Äî

1. Replying right away but scheduling the send for a more appropriate time. I love the idea. 

2. Having students wait until office hours to ask questions about assignments. Very interesting. I don‚Äôt hold routine office hours, so it wouldn‚Äôt work for me, but I can see it as a good way to teach students to plan ahead for those who do host regular office hours.

3. Having specific hours of the day when they reply to student emails. I like this one too. I might try this for future students with an early course announcement like: ‚ÄúI reply to student emails each day from 3-4 pm. Consider this our virtual, asynchronous office hour. Make sure to plan ahead and work on your assignments in advance so that you have enough time to ask any questions that may arise for you.‚Äù I like this. 

They really do need help adjusting to professional norms. Their future bosses will not thank us if we encourage them to expect immediate responses to requests.

1mpz6kq,"Advice for designing short ""video response"" assignments to be used with in-person classes?","I'm thinking of trying some form of video response/reflection assignments in a class this fall.  Have never attempted it before.  Here's some additional context and some tentative parameters I'm envisioning:

**Class Modality:**  in-person

**Discipline:**  a humanities field

**Class level:** introductory/gen-ed (mainly freshmen and sophomores)

**Class size:** \~25

**Assignment frequency:** weekly (or maybe bi-weekly would be better to avoid student and instructor burnout?)

**What students will be responding to:**  in-class discussions  
(which may include small group discussions, whole class discussions, or some combination)

**Timeframe:**  If a discussion takes place in class on a Monday, students would need to post their video response before the next class meeting on Wednesday

**Assignment Type and Weighting:** formative and fairly low-stakes; assignment category as a whole (for all video responses combined) would be about 10-15% of the total grade

**Assignment Objective:** students should demonstrate that they paid attention and have given some further thought to a few specific points from the discussion

Ex: making a connection from the day's discussion to other assigned materials or discussions from the course; raising further questions; connecting a point from discussion to some aspect of their personal or educational experience; etc..  I have a list of open-ended reflective questions I already ask them to use with assigned readings and other materials that I would modify it to apply for discussion-based reflection so they would have something to use as a guide.

**Time limit for each response:**  3 minutes (is that long enough/too long?)

Would love any advice (including any suggested modifications to my tentative parameters above) from those who have tried this type of assignment, whether the advice is based on a sucess story or a flaming fiasco!

1l1bw8e,Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting a PhD Abroad,"Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôm putting together a few insights that I wish I had known before starting my PhD abroad. Whether you're applying to programs in Europe, the US, or elsewhere, these might help someone out there navigating similar challenges:

1. **Understand the Funding Model Early:** Not all PhD programs abroad are fully funded. Some include stipends and tuition waivers, others don't. Always ask about what's covered especially living expenses.
2. **Know Your Rights as a PhD Student:** In some countries, PhD students are considered employees. In others, you‚Äôre more like a student. This impacts things like contracts, working hours, and supervision expectations.
3. **Build a Support Network from Day 1:** Isolation hits harder abroad. Try to join writing groups, attend workshops, or find accountability buddies online or locally. It makes a huge difference.
4. **Supervisor Fit Matters More Than Prestige:** A famous university won‚Äôt save you from a toxic supervisor. Choose someone who supports your research goals and communication style.
5. **Document Everything:** From emails with your supervisor to lab notes, keeping records can save you from confusion or disputes later.
6. **It's Okay to Take Time Off:** Burnout is real. Don‚Äôt fall into the ‚ÄúI have to work 80 hours a week‚Äù trap. Quality matters more than hours logged.

Fellow PhDs or applicants what‚Äôs something you wish you knew before you started your program abroad? Would love to hear your perspectives too.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1l1bw8e/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_starting_a_phd_abroad/,0
1n1mvl0,Advice on LORs and Electives to a 3rd yr (EM/IM),"I'll try to keep this direct and to the point bc I know we don't all have time for essays.

OMS-III, interested in EM or IM. Older, non-trad career changer. My main target for residency is to be back in a mid sized city - pre-clinicals were also in a rural town.

Current rotation site: community hospital, level 3 trauma center, no IM residency.

Research: None right now, but at least will have one by the end (school required).

EM: I'm trying to do my spring elective in EM at a different site bc I'd like some more exposure. My mandatory EM is 1st block 4th yr. Running into lots of roadblocks as a 3rd yr, with those slots going to 4th yrs (to be expected). My main knock against this specialty is the burnout tales and that others have said there are no ""old"" ED docs. I'm already old and don't plan to retire just as I'm starting. Also, there's no plan B for this specialty (no OP work that I know of other than admin which I don't want to do).

IM + LORs: Pro for IM is more subspecialty options and IP/OP options for most specialties. However, residency quality will matter when it comes to matching fellowships.

My main concern is I won't have an IM PD letter (no home program). Our site dean is pretty involved and usually writes LORs (assuming we don't do something stupid) but he's not IM. I didn't ask for a LOR from my very first rotation with a outpatient PCP (IM trained) bc I was getting my bearings and only spent a week with him. I'm considering spending a 4th yr elective with him because he's sharp as a tack and could write me a good letter (he gave a good eval but comments were generic). Problem is I only have 1 elective slot in 4th year before ERAS apps need to be submitted so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to ""get it right"". Should I spend that 4th yr instead at another hospital in IM?

w94k76,Why don't more CS students take reduced course loads instead of burning out and dropping out of CS?," It seems that one of the biggest reasons students in CS suffer from burn-out and drop out is because of the heavy course-load of 5 or so classes per semester. Doesn't it make more sense to just reduce your course load so that you can potentially avoid burn out which probably leads to dropping out? It seems people have this ""all or nothing - do or die mindset"". I never understood this because I have friends who never even attempted part time course loads, they just went from full time to dropping out completely. Why?

EDIT: Did not realize the financial cost of school in the US. It‚Äôs like 8-10K here in Canada. It also seems like your scholarships, etc only cover 4 years.

1loxtzz,Thinking of leaving my Oxford PhD ‚Äî how do I know I‚Äôve really tried?,"Hi all ‚Äî I‚Äôm 28 and currently doing a PhD at Oxford, UK, in Engineeing. I applied mostly because it was Oxford and in a field related to my previous job ‚Äî I always wanted to do a PhD and thought it would give me structure, credibility, maybe even pride. But nearly two years in, I‚Äôm starting to question whether I‚Äôve truly given this a fair shot, or whether it‚Äôs just not right for me.

I completed my first-year modules, but then intermitted for 9 months due to burnout and several family bereavements. During that time, I was also diagnosed as autistic and with ADHD ‚Äî which explained a lot about why I‚Äôd been struggling to stay afloat, masking constantly, and running on fumes.

When I came back, things initially felt better. I had some strategies, more clarity, and genuine motivation. But over the last few months, I‚Äôve felt myself slipping again ‚Äî back into procrastination, disconnection, and exhaustion. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gained any skills or momentum. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve just‚Ä¶ existed through this, rather than grown.

I‚Äôm funded via a standard stipend, but was supposed to receive an uplift from my external sponsor. Despite chasing it over and over, it‚Äôs never come through ‚Äî and after two years, that uncertainty has really worn me down. The admin and comms have been messy and demoralising.

I haven‚Äôt made friends here. I‚Äôm not sure how well I tried, and I still feel isolated. Most days I work alone, or avoid working altogether because I‚Äôm too overwhelmed. And to be honest, I don‚Äôt even know if I care about my research topic anymore ‚Äî but I also don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs burnout talking, or if I just chose a project for the institution, not the subject.

I keep asking myself: have I tried hard enough to know this isn‚Äôt right for me? Or am I quitting something I haven‚Äôt really let myself engage with?
I‚Äôm scared that leaving would be a mistake ‚Äî but I‚Äôm also scared that staying would be one too. I don‚Äôt want to spend years trying to force myself into an environment I‚Äôm not built for.

If you‚Äôve left your PhD (especially after intermission, burnout), did you regret it? What helped you make that call?

134oo6k,Are mornings really that hard?,"This is partly a vent but I also very much want to know what others' experiences are.

I taught two sections of the same class this past semester.  One met at 9:30, the other met at 3:30.  I used the exact same slides, same material, same activities; everything was identical.  I use a flipped classroom so everything revolves around active learning and is super hands-on.  

The 9:30 class was like talking to zombies.  They were reluctant to speak, struggled to follow, and almost every single student was tangibly exhausted during every class.  Many routinely arrived late as well.

The 3:30 section was the complete opposite - every student was sharp, engaged, talkative, and very quick with the material.  They even seemed happy to be there - they genuinely seemed to enjoy the experience.

I've never experienced anything like this before.  I've seen different classroom ""cultures"" emerge based on the personalities of the students, etc., but this seemed different.  My best guess is that the time of day made the difference.

1h4zjle,Am I really cut out for a PhD?,"
Hey!

I‚Äôm a new PhD student in ECE. It‚Äôs been two months since I started, and honestly, I feel completely out of my depth. I can‚Äôt shake this overwhelming sense of inadequacy, like I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. It‚Äôs exhausting and makes me feel stupid, like I‚Äôm bound to fail, quit halfway, and let everyone down, including myself.

These feelings didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. They‚Äôve been haunting me since my undergrad days. I was a C student, rarely ever got A‚Äôs. My academic advisor even suggested I quit my major because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt cut out for it.‚Äù I seriously considered it but somehow managed to scrape through to graduation. My CGPA was the lowest in my batch, and when I graduated, I still had no idea what I had learned. My degree feels like a source of shame, something I‚Äôd bury and forget about if I could.

When I go to my department and see the students and lecturers, I feel like a stranger, like I don‚Äôt belong there. It feels like a place for geniuses, not for someone dumb like me.

When I got into my Master‚Äôs program, I swore I‚Äôd turn things around. It was coursework based, no research involved (just a project paper in the final semester), and there wasn‚Äôt even a viva voce to stress over. To my surprise, it went really well. I aced my courses, earning 99% A‚Äôs, and my supervisor was incredibly kind. She encouraged me to turn my project paper into a thesis, helped me present at conferences, and even co-authored two papers with me. I finished with no corrections on my paper, which felt surreal.

But even with all that, I couldn‚Äôt shake the imposter syndrome. It all felt like a fluke, like sheer dumb luck, not my effort or abilities. Deep down, I still see myself as the same pathetic, clueless C student I was in undergrad.

Now I‚Äôm here in a PhD program, where the stakes are higher, the journey tougher, and there‚Äôs no smooth path or lucky breaks to rely on. Part of me is excited by the challenge, but the doubt weighs so heavily. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll give up when it gets too hard, and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint myself again. I don‚Äôt want to choose comfort over a long-term challenge that could change my life.

I fear the comprehensive examination next year. I‚Äôm terrified I won‚Äôt pass it. But even before that, I‚Äôm struggling with the literature review. Reading papers feels like an impossible task. I procrastinate because I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt understand them. And when I do read, I often get stuck on certain information, unable to make sense of it, which leaves me frustrated and feeling even more inadequate. Literature review feels like hell.

I want to break out of this mindset and become someone I can be proud of, someone who can look back in a few years and say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I did it.‚Äù I want to feel like I belong in this journey.

Will I succeed? Will I ever truly feel like I‚Äôm fit to be a PhD student?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1h4zjle/am_i_really_cut_out_for_a_phd/,1

I know he's been depressed, but I'm not sure how to help when he won't talk to me and has refused to see a psychiatrist or a therapist. This is the same dude that didn't talk to me the 2 weeks leading up to both Step 1 and Step 2 (I asked for support and he said that I'm always stressed so it wasn't his problem). Same one that will say I don't make time for him, but when I ask to hang out he's usually been busy. Same one that I've been quick to forgive and tried to be there for since I know that sharing a life with a medical student is difficult. Same guy that was at one time my very best friend.

I know I've asked a lot of him with med school dictating my (and therefore his) life. I wonder how things may have been different if I wasn't in medicine. This makes the decisions I make for residency seem all the more important so this doesn't happen again.

q8qbqg,I Got 7 New Grad Offers: The Sequel (and tips that worked for me!),"Hello again r/csMajors! Some of you may remember me from my [incorrectly titled post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jgt7ce/i_got_7_internship_offers_a_long_summary_of_my/) where I received ""7"" (eventually 9) internship offers. After that whirlwind of a recruiting season, I was expecting to have a more laid-back time this year, especially with a return offer from my internship under my belt.

I submitted 41 applications (most of them as a joke) vs my 120+ from last year, sat back, and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of responses I got, so I decided to make another Reddit post.

**About Me:**

* Senior @ large state school (can tell which one by my post history, again)
* Double majoring in CS & Business Analytics
* 3.3 GPA (higher than last year thanks to open notes exams...)
* Two internships, a part time tech support job, 2 leadership positions (VP of one club, director of another) at school, 2 projects
* US Citizen

I tried to do a Sankey, but that quickly got confusing because this time around, a few of my interview processes were through the CodePath career fair & my prior recruiting contacts (I attended Grace Hopper but it only barely helped this time around, mostly because I was being selective with the number of interviews I was doing). So here's some quick facts instead.

**Quick Stats From This Year:**

* **Applications Submitted: 41**
* **Offers Received: 7 (JPMorgan return offer, IBM, VMWare, Asana, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, NBCUniversal)**
* **# of Resume Rejects: only one** (thanks Duolingo)
* **# of Total Rejections: 15** (mostly after OAs & interviews)
* **Interviews Done: 20** (including first rounds & finals)

**Notable Moments:**

* **Rejected from Hubspot after final** because it was my first ever System Design interview and I hadn't studied, oops...
* **Rejected from Microsoft after final** because one of my interviewers insisted my answer was wrong... when it was right... and the code ran with the correct output... whatever. No hard feelings!
* **Visa did 4 technical interviews, and then asked for a FIFTH one** so I finally turned them down.
* **Rejected from Facebook after first phone** because it was my first interview of the season and I hadn't interviewed anywhere in a year.
* **During my VMWare final interviews, one round was entirely systems/OS/networking questions. I'd never taken a systems class in my entire college career.** Even though I answered ""I don't know"" to every question, and had to explain why I didn't take Systems/OS to the interviewer, I still got the offer somehow?
* **Got sent the Google snapshot. I didn't do it. Recruiter reached out to me asking me to do it. I ghosted the recruiter.** I was absolutely exhausted after interviewing so much & Google's process is known to take FOREVER. Freshman me would probably slap current me if she knew though.
* **Asana's final round was the longest I'd ever done, at 5 hours & 15 minutes, and because of time zones it ended at 9 PM my time** but it was also the most enjoyable interview process I've ever done, even when it was so long & ended relatively late.

If anyone's interested I can add a list of every single company I interviewed with this fall in an edit, but since I only applied to 40 places the list would be kind of short. I also don't want to ramble on like I did in my post last year!

**Tips for recruiting?**

* For full time (or even 2nd/3rd internships), **""warm"" email any recruiters you talked to in the past.** Especially if you got far in their process last time, they'll probably be willing to take a chance on you again (make sure to re-introduce yourself if it's been a while). With Facebook I failed the first phone for their internship last year, but I emailed my recruiter this year and his response was ""I was meaning to reach out to you again, just apply and I'll send you the first phone scheduling right after"" so you literally never know.
* **Programs like CodePath and Facebook's ABCS really helped me.** Why? Because I study better with concrete goals/homework and other people, in a class-like setting. Facebook's ABCS is very well suited for sophomores & juniors seeking internships. CodePath's advanced technical interview prep class is suited towards full time since they cover a bit of system design. CodePath is especially great because their homework is directly assigned from Leetcode, and if you don't do it you get kicked from the program. Finish it all, and you get access to their invite-only career fair with 50+ companies. Pretty good incentive to Leetcode if you ask me.
* **Get your application in front of human eyes as quickly as possible.** Even if its not your actual application, visit the company at a career fair or something, and if you get the chance to talk with a recruiter, tell them you applied and are interested in their opportunities -- they're more likely to go and check at your application after. This is how I got ""un-ghosted"" -- talking to recruiters at GHC and the CodePath career fair.
* **SOFT SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT.** If you know how to solve a problem but can't explain your reasoning clearly to the interviewer, they WILL be confused. I think that's what cost me the Microsoft interview this year -- see above, I probably didn't explain my correct solution well enough. On the other hand, though, I can't count how many times I was absolutely clueless during an interview, but my communication & honesty saved me -- see VMWare above.
* **If you're job searching for the first time, get your resume reviewed & PUT IT THROUGH A PARSER.** Human feedback is definitely the first step, but after you quantify your descriptions and find a good layout, put your resume through a site like [jobscan.co](https://jobscan.co), VMock (offered by some schools' career centers), or even the few student-made parsers I've seen on this subreddit to see if it accurately determines your major/experience etc from your resume.
* **Studying for System Design? Use the** [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)**.** I didn't pay for Grokking, the primer had everything I needed to pass Asana's system design portion. If only I'd studied it for Hubspot...
* **Remember, you only need one offer.** It was definitely discouraging to me as an underclassman when I saw people picking between every FAANG and Citadel, but remember if you're starting out, all you need is that first company to give you a chance. Having choices is great (and sometimes scary) but even a single offer & nothing else can open a LOT of doors moving forward, so once you get that first offer letter, pat yourself on the back! You made it through a bunch of filtering to get there, and now the only direction you can go is even higher :)

If you've made it this far, you may be wondering **which offer I accepted** \-- I'm not gonna take up any more space on this post, so **check out my flair on this subreddit for your answer ;)**

Besides that, if anyone has questions about anything related to internship or full time recruiting/handling offers/my experiences/etc, **feel free to ask in the comments and I'll be answering as many as I can!** Since I've gotten 17 offers total in my time at college, I've pretty much done it all at this point so I want to give back and help all of you out too :D thanks for reading!

\--

Brief Edit: After signing my offer this morning I accidentally walked straight into a trash can on the way to class; the comments about trash cans are all my friends hahah

1e7jsa6,My former grad advisor is a reminder of why I decided not to pursue science.,"Half way through my PhD I took a leave of absence. My graduate advisor, an attractive white woman, was incessantly on my case about how many hours I was in lab. It didn‚Äôt matter that I had two first author papers and my name on other publications, she wanted my ass in the seat for 12 hours a day. She was terrible to women and minorities in her lab and constantly asked us to toe the ethical line to make our data pretty. She ‚Äòunintentionally‚Äô spread rumors that I had a drug addiction even though I tried endlessly to communicate I was burned out, which was unacceptable to her. The final straw was her inability to pursue the next step in my project, beyond the low hanging fruit. 

During my leave I decided I was going to quit but I needed a job. I began working in another lab while I figured things out. This professor was unlike anything I had experienced. Always engaged with the null hypothesis, never removed the outlying data because the natural world is fucking messy and not a pretty graph and, as a white man, was the most inclusive and caring boss I have ever had. I ended up finishing my PhD in his lab and my proudest career moments are the work and publications I did with him. His research was solid, flawless yet still humble. He has continued to struggle to get funding because his research suggests an entire field has gotten it wrong.

Meanwhile, my former advisor has received accolade after accolade, grant after grant while regularly flirting with the old white grant gate keepers, at least during my time in her lab. I just found out she got a fellowship for aiding women and minorities in science. 

I still struggle with leaving but times like these make me realize I can‚Äôt be successful and happy in a world I ethically reject.

Edit: I forgot the best part. One of her senior grad students verbally (almost physically) assaulted me in her lab because of my ethnicity. She did everything she could to get me to not file a complaint because he had such a promising future and he wasn‚Äôt really racist, just really stressed out over graduating.

my last semester i stayed clean the whole time and ended up getting a 3.5 gpa in like the hardest classes i've ever taken, but that gave me zero time to grind leetcode or read the crack book. i look at all these 20yr olds that have internships at FAANG companies and feel like i can't compete at all.

tl;dr the imposter syndrome is kicking my ass and i'm starting to worry it's not imposter syndrome and i just suck. i cried after that hackerrank. sorry for rambling, looking for advice or encouragement",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kjkd71/i_am_the_imposter/,1
1m96b58,Hit the wall at work,"A cry for help and advise.

I am a university professor from Russia . After I graduated with honors from my undergraduate program,  i immediately started working full-time as a lecturer, while simultaneously persuing my master's and actively engaging in  top-tier research.


I used to be able to teach five classes in a row from 9 am to 6pm , without a break for food or even the bathroom, then go to my own evening courses until 9 pm, come home, eat, and start doing homework... and, honestly, I felt... fine...

But now I feel like I‚Äôve hit a wall... In 2023, during my third year of teaching, after a series of unpleasant events, I fell into a completely miserable state: I kept working on two major research projects, teaching a huge number of courses‚Äîbasically plugging every hole I could‚Äîand studying in a PhD program. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt sleep for 48 hours straight and just work-work-work. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt even have the energy to shower (yes, I didn‚Äôt care that I stinked), I became easily irritable, flinching at every noise, and more... In December the whole month I worked with a 39¬∞C fever because I was afraid of letting the students down‚Äîafter all I get at least some kind of life energy  when I‚Äôm with them, and I feel like my life has some kind of meaning (since, no matter how hard I worked, I was constantly being told by my higher-up that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough‚Äîsomething I later realized was partly because I didn‚Äôt complain and never told them I was pulling all-nighters to meet their deadlines‚Äîbut that‚Äôs a whole other story). And I think that was the final strow that broke my back: even though most of my teaching load ended by the end of 2023, and I finally had some time to take care of myself, I still felt like I was drowning in some kind of deep swamp... it was incredibly disheartening.

The summer of 2024 I spent basically without a vacation, dealing with some family issues and wrapping up research projects (I didn't visit my hometown even once during summerto see my parents‚Äîthere just wasn‚Äôt time). And now, in 2025, my entire legally allotted vacation, my whole summer, is being eaten up by writing this pointless brick of a dissertation.

Why is it taking me so long to write? Because No matter how hard I try, it feels like I‚Äôm slogging through some very dark wasteland‚ÄîIam writing actively, using up energy I have left into it, but it takes me three times longer than it should... which means no rest this year either.

 I even considered taking academic leave‚Äîif only this weren‚Äôt the very final stretch of my PhD.
As is often the case with teachers, I‚Äôm constantly sick, constantly tired, and my mood swings wildly. Overall, I don't feel bad ALl the time  yet I feel like all the joy I experience now does not compare at all to 2021‚Äì2022, because everything I feel is like... in a fog.

I‚Äôve heard that in Europe, one can  take a  temporary disability  due to depression... unfortunately, that is not possible in my country, 'cause people with mental illness record are prohibited from teaching. Which is why I have no idea what I can do in this situation, because I don‚Äôt want the repeat of 2023, when I lived in constant paranoia that I was being watched, with a clogged toilet full of shit I kept going to and defecating until it over-poured anyways because I literally did not have the capacity to get up and fix it‚Äîbut I still kept showing up to classes and trying to smile... 

The upcoming academic year looks like it won‚Äôt be that difficult: I will not have any big research projects, no more PhD obligations after defending in the fall. And when I am writing it, I even feel like I can wait one more like this and take it thru,  But I don't know

I am honestly, jealous of my classmates‚Äîthose who could afford not to work from their third year of undergrad onwards let alone those whose parents allowed them to take time off between life stages to recover. I am jealous of western people who don't have five years of teaching experience by 26 and are not expected to yield q1  articles by then.

Right now, it feels like this career has eaten away several years of my life for nothing and just led me into a deep, empty nowhere, but there is no alternative rout I can take. 

I don't know. Have anyone been in this situation? How can i escape this?

1munuq6,How to stop dreading and avoiding writing papers/proposals,"I've always considered myself a strong writer and have been told I'm a good writer. But now as a grad student, it is the #1 type of task that I try to avoid subconsciously. I find myself dreading it so much and making it up to be such a huge ordeal in my head.

Especially around my niche topic of interest that I've been working on for years. Maybe it's something about that- writing and rewriting about the same things over and over... It should make it easier in a way, but there's this feeling like it's never quite perfect and also not really improving much, and getting tired of hearing myself talk about it. Using the same arguments more than once makes me question myself more and more, and wonder if it was good enough to say twice or ten times.

I also just worry that I won't be able to get all my thoughts out clearly or they won't come together right. I feel overwhelmed by how many different ways there are to communicate things -- The many that I think of and go back and forth on, plus all the others I haven't thought of. I always feel like I'm forgetting something and it's never quite satisfying to me. There's always something to improve and I'm always juggling different advice I've heard and followed over the years... my brain is like: ""be extremely clear and straightforward... but wait, don't be redundant, and just show don't tell"" ""be very easy to understand and use plain language... but wait, don't be boring and formulaic"" ""use precise vocabulary.. but wait, make it accessible to the general public too"" ""be thorough... but wait, no one cares about these details and you're losing people""

1kor56c,Totally lost on how (and if) I should be switching from academia to industry,"Hi all,

I am a young-ish postdoc (30-ish) in automation/ control engineering/applied mathematics from a developed country, and I am currently at a point in life where I am struggling to justify the current state of academia.

I feel really overwhelmed by the fact that what seems to matter most is the sheer number of papers one has to publish just to have a shot. This has led me to the realization that I am on the slower side. I need to fully understand any area of the macro-subject I am working with before I can feel comfortable, namely, I have to be able to derive all the tools I am using from a basic set of assumptions.

Furthermore, during my employment, I was never offered the opportunity to tutor students or collaborate with other Ph.D.s. As a result, the menial tasks such as running simulations were always mine to handle, along with writing the main body of the text and the proofs, doing the literature review, and fixing any issues that came up to some degree. Now, in between jobs, with my next one starting in two months, this has finally changed. I have been able to foster some connections. However, it already feels too late to have any decent shot at an academic future.

This situation was not helped by the fact that I suffered from a serious illness last year, which still affects me to some extent, and that the COVID period during my Ph.D. was quite harsh on me. Still, I take full responsibility for not being fast enough.

To make matters worse, while applying for academic jobs, I keep getting replies from professors asking whether I would be willing to play the grant lottery with them without any pay. This only amplifies the bad feelings I have toward the system, which does not help on the motivation front. I do enjoy doing research and tackling real problems, but I can no longer tolerate the many superficial behaviors I see in some of my peers.

So, this year, I decided to seriously try to transition to industry while still maintaining some ties to academia. I know industry is not perfect, but I feel it would open up more options for me once I get in. The pay would likely be better as well, and I would be free from these never-ending one-year contracts with an optional second renewal.

However, it has now been six months and I have not even landed an interview. And this is breaking me.

So I would really appreciate some advice from people with real experience. I would like to ask:
i) How can I better present or sell myself on the job market? (Type of resume? Word over pdf? ...) ii) Am I just being a sour loser, which is how I feel, and will I regret walking away from academia later? Or should I keep pushing forward and postpone the decision a bit longer?

I would really love to hear some honest advice from people who have been through it.

Edit: I used ChatGPT to double-check if there were any mistakes in the text and copied the prompt, too.

I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how ‚Äúgracious‚Äù he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won‚Äôt be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless.

123ppzd,The constant cringefest that is grad school,"In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work/internship/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.

In grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, ""There are much better uses of my time than this,"" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.

I've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing.

1knoqkq,Brain stopped working during class,"Hi all, requesting any stories you can share to make me feel better about the embarrassment I suffered in my class today!

  
Some context: I am going through some pretty extreme stress with a sick/elderly parent, a trial I have to testify for approaching, some issues that happened with a specific student and caused some administrative drama, on top of an already busy and demanding schedule. Today I also had a specialty health appointment that I had been waiting 6 months for and ended in disappointing / upsetting news. I teach 2 classes for adult learners on Thursdays, both online, once in the afternoon and once in the evening.

  
By my evening class, I was exhausted but working through it, teaching material that I know very well and have been over many times. But then suddenly I noticed myself becoming less and less coherent and then my brain seemed to freeze for a full minute. This was an online class and I *stopped talking for a full minute*. I could see the students looking confused / worried which increased my panic. Eventually I composed myself, apologized and went on. I seemed to get a second wind after that and the rest of the class went on fine aside from the fact that I was embarrassed and apologized / made excuses several more times before class was up.

  
This is probably the third time I have been super exhausted during this class and it's beyond embarrassing to make the excuse of, ""I'm sorry class, I'm so tired"" for a *scheduled* evening class. I feel like the students are seeing the worst of me and I don't want them to leave with the impression that I am a bad teacher, unprofessional, etc. If I was a student seeing this class, I would have thought ""wow this person is drunk or there is something wrong with them"".

My first postdoc was tough, and not nearly as productive as I would have imagined or liked, but I learnt a lot from it, and am now seeing some of the work I've done be published (~6 months after finishing). My mental health suffered quite a lot during my second year there, mostly due to some issues with my boss, and the relationship we had, which started off very nice, really deteriorated towards the end of it. Alas, I finished, and got out..

.. into another postdoc. I was pretty happy to secure this job, as when I interviewed for it, I hadn't published anything new since finishing my PhD. Nevertheless, recommendations (from my PhD supervisor, not my postdoc supervisor) were sufficient to get me the job. I'm in a slightly different, albeit similar, field.

1hxmbr8,starting the semester strong & recovering from post-burnout bad habits [US],"Hello all! The **TL;DR** is basically in the title, but the slight expansion is: I have been *very* burnt out for quite awhile, and have become very used to procrastinating and using various vices (mostly excessive reading) as escapism. As I am moving forward into this new semester, I'm feeling hopeful and mostly prepared, but my burnout-vices have become extremely habitual, and I'm struggling to create new, constructive habits. How do I reengage myself as a grad student? I appreciate any and all tips--even if it's not helpful to me, it might be to someone else.

\---

Okay now the longer version if you want more context:

I'm technically a second-year PhD student in astro, though I largely consider myself a first-year as I am mostly completing first-year courses. Things have been difficult from the get-go. I've struggled to keep up with work, struggled to care about my classes, struggled to care about my research. I got extremely burnt out at the end of undergrad, and would have taken a year off if I had not won the NSF (which you can't defer).

To be honest, I was doing quite well with getting caught up, then this past semester just had one thing after another go wrong and had to take an Incomplete in yet another class and I barely completed *last* years' Incompletes. I used to be very on top of things, and though I am trying not to romanticize my undergrad self (who was very studious but also very lonely) it's hard not to. I don't really trust myself anymore when I say I am going to do something, though I am starting to do this more and more often.

I considered dropping out for awhile, but realized eventually it was burnout/depression-induced apathy. After a lot of soul-searching (and therapy) I discovered I *do* actually want to complete this degree, but I've gotten *really* used to procrastinating. That's the big issue: Regardless of actual motivation and dedication, I am used to quick dopamine hits. My ""vice"" of choice is reading fiction, which probably doesn't sound like such a bad thing but it takes hours out of every day. I'm not trying to stop reading, but I would like to get a handle on how much control it has over my life. **In general, I really want to start this new semester strong, and carry that through. I want to prove to myself that I** ***am*** **capable of getting my PhD.**

Firstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I‚Äôve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people‚Äôs resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that‚Äôs a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that‚Äôs something worth sharing or if maybe I‚Äôm just not ready yet to be applying to internships.

Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I‚Äôve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they‚Äôre not very relevant to cs so I don‚Äôt wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it‚Äôs worth adding? Lmk guys.

Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help üôÅ.

Ok thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1n5cft8/questions_from_a_cooked_sophomore/,0
i40akg,[Vent] A doctor in Beirut,"I would like to share briefly my experience as a young doctor during the aftermath of the explosion that devastated beirut yesterday.


To summarize briefly it was a warzone.


The hospitals were over crowded, was running from patient to patient, suturing in dirty condition even though I tried my best to keep it sterile. We were over exhausted but during all this bleak situation I saw doctors, nurses, surgeon all coming from various places all around lebanon just to help. They were just here helping the other. Those who couldn‚Äôt help us provided us with some food and water. It was a heartwarming scene during this crisis.


Thank you for listening to me. I needed to get this out.

Edit: Thanks all for the amazing response. If you want to help, donate to Lebanese NGO like the Lebanese [Red Cross ](https://supportlrc.app/donate/) or to [Impact Lebanon](http://help-lebanon.me/).

1k2e5kd,I am the worst student ever and I really just want to cry,"I started in September as a pre doc. I never really wanted to work in academia. It just sort of happened because my previous career attempts didn't work out and I was unemployed and this institute somehow decided my CV was good enough to work with them. It's sort of related to what I used to do anyway and it is a great institute with a great name. I struggle with mental health and I thought this could be my chance to a fresh start. I moved countries to be here and I hoped for the best.

But I am not good enough.

My supervisor is a star of his field. He publishes all the time, works like a horse, knows everyone. He has a great eye for detail and misses NOTHING. He is always ready to give on point advice and is extremely involved in his students' activities.

I am the opposite. I am slow and sloppy and can't get things done. I do my best or what I think it's my best but it's just not at the level needed. Sometimes I have very short bursts when I think I maybe have it figured out and I am on the right track but then reality quickly shows up at the door in the form of my supervisor being disappointed with me.

We have this project where I have to manually transcribe data from 150+ locations. There is no way to make it automatic, the data are just too chaotic and sparse. The way it works is that we filter out the locations where the results from the data analysis are above a certain threshold. So the data transcription and analysis is crucial for everything that comes afterwards. My supervisor had asked for an extra hand because it's a lot of work and so I volunteered - it was very relevant to my own research anyway. But I wish I never did.

Essentially I lost track of the data analysis at some point and made a mess. Twice. I was lucky that the mess didn't end up affecting anyone's work, in the sense that it could be fixed easily without compromising the entirety of the paper (which will be submitted in two weeks and is a team effort). But my supervisor was very clearly angry and impatient at me for being so sloppy AGAIN. He is the kind of person that never gets impatient with anyone so that was really hard to witness.

And then there are other things. I am leading a scoping review with 8k studies. After screening them all on Covidence, I realized that the papers that had passed the screening were not what I was expecting whilst the ones that I meant to talk about didn't show up at all and my search terms were pointless. So essentially the whole review was worthless. I had to reshuffle and reorganise the terms completely and my supervisor had to send an email to Covidence asking them to reset our review so that we could start from scratch as we only have one paid license. Our initial goal was to publish in early May.

On top of that I have to take classes, which I imagine is normal for a pre doc, and I wonder how people manage because I most certainly do not.

I am writing a paper and the review and the project are tangentially related but I have neither the time nor the energy to properly research references and put things together coherently. Whenever I submit written material to my supervisor he basically re writes 90% of it.

I haven't published anything yet. I have been here since September and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. 

Doesn't help that my supervisor is from another continent and I often feel we just communicate on two fundamentally different levels. I feel I am constantly failing him. I am grateful to be here and I am grateful that he's my supervisor but I don't think he knows. I think he believes I'm shit.

I am sure lots of conversations about me and my performance are happening behind closed doors. I am ""that student"". I have already noticed subtle hints. Like the way my boss increased the frequency of our meetings and at the same time how he reduced the number and difficulty of my tasks, the way he went from being relatively friendly to somewhat annoyed etc. And oh my God do I feel embarrassed about it. I am so self conscious and aware of it and yet I can't seem to change.

I tried to be a good student and colleague, humble, proactive, diligent, but it always ends up with me getting overwhelmed and making a mess.

pa7uyj,"Would you recommend anyone to do a PhD, or do you regret doing one, after your experience?","Curious. I had a pretty terrible experience; overly stressful, constant imposter syndrome, constant uphill battle to keep up with PhD demands, constant anxiety, struggles with supervisor.

1iajksd,"Fired for being ""too stressed."" At a loss right now.","Hey reddit,
Dealing with a lot right now. 
Tl;dr: my advisor decided I get too stressed about setbacks and picked up that I wasn't happy in general (she says) and decided to fire me about it. At a loss for how to process this, generally struggling with next steps.

Long version:
I'm a PhD candidate in biosci at a US ""top 20"" school. I joined with a strong interest in synthetic biology, and ended up in an engineering department with an advisor who was in the act of ""branching out"" into synthetic biology. I picked up a project that had been passed down through two postdocs and had relatively little in common with the rest of the lab research (some vague abstractions tied it to other work, but very few technical bridges). The second postdoc was there for my rotation, but his contract ended in the first month of it being my (supposed) thesis lab.

I experienced a gradual decline in being happy with my lab. It is not a lab that values mentorship at all, which is a deep struggle we all share. As I progressed in understanding my research area, I slowly came to realize that much (not all) of the work done by the postdocs was not working, but specifically not working in ways that should have been anticipated from knowing the literature. The root of the problem was an advisor who did not understand synthetic biology or the area of work in general. I repeatedly had to remind her or teach her fundamental knowledge of the field, and eventually I quit going to her for advice outright. She is the most ""hands-off"" advisor I have encountered, meaning she doesn't ask for updates or seem to really give a shit about what it is I'm doing (unless it gives her a publication).

Much of my first year was spent trying to replicate some data that I built much of my thesis proposal on. She repeatedly pressured me to publish the postdoc's data with arbitrary deadlines until I outright refused due to it not replicating. I dug up raw data earlier this month and found out they ran 5 assays, and showed only the one where it ""worked."" The other 4 looked identical to my data. 

My stress hit a boiling point one month before my qualifying exam, when I had done about 3-4 months of troubleshooting a method, then I found out it was impossible with the materials I had due to a mutation in our lab strain. I suspected this a year ago and asked everyone involved, but dropped the matter because our strain had been sequenced, analyzed, and published as a supplemental figure. That sequencing analysis was simply flat WRONG, and the person who did it had told me before: ""She (ex advisor) will push you to publish, even if it's not ready, even if it's bullshit."" This left me with functionally no progress on my first aim, 1 month from my qual.

I tried to address the issue with ex-advisor, but after getting an ""ok,"" and an ""I don't know,"" I lost my head a little. I apologized for this later, but there was never a discussion about how I was effected, or how the wrong analysis was published, and I was told NOT to talk about it during my qual. She said that there will be a correction, but every attempt I made to follow up was shut down with indifference or hostility.

I passed my qual in November and got on with life. Early this January, we had a meeting with the Ombuds where she said I don't seem happy. I agreed and said I need more hands-on mentorship. She said that if I was going to seek that, I already would have (at the time I was actively pursuing an internship and an external collaboration). She decided that because I was getting so stressed, that a PhD is not worth the emotional toll for me and I shouldn't do a PhD anywhere. She basically then gaslit me into leaving the lab by telling me I should find a new advisor and not answering if I was being kicked out of the lab. 

I don't know if that correction letter will ever happen, and I'm considering going to the provost. 

Anyway, I hated that bitch, so I'm out of the frying pan. But now I'm desperately looking for new labs and opportunities and stressed out of my mind (into the fire). I did truly believe in my project, even though that lab was not supporting it, so it may be time to grieve that. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. 

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read this far.

1cxsg5a,Do it already: get stricter with your attendance and late work policies,"I know institutional/school/departmental policies and support vary among us, but if you can get stricter with your attendance and late work policies, I encourage you to do so next semester. After lots of hand wringing over wanting to bring more structure into my classes since loosening my attendance and late work policies since covid, I finally went ahead with it this spring. I expected lots of complaints and groveling for special exceptions, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn‚Äôt the case.

I had no complaints (at least none to my face; evals forthcoming), and only a handful of students asked for exceptions (a few deserving and I was happy to make the requested accommodations). One student, after realizing that I was going to enforce my policies, told me that he ""locked in"" and will now pass the class with an A. Several students told me that these policies actually helped them stay on top of the coursework and motivated them to come to class, and they could see a direct correlation between doing those things and performing well. On my end, I can attest that what they are feeling is actually true as I see higher class averages in all of my courses. So even if they do complain in the evals, I‚Äôll point to the success rates as my rebuttal.

Another benefit is that I am no longer haunted: getting stricter has drastically cut down on the amount of ghosts emailing me on the last days of the semester asking ‚Äúif there‚Äôs a way‚Äù to still pass the class, offering to turn in months worth of missing assignments to add to the pile of finals that I‚Äôm grading.

And I‚Äôve had fewer cases of that new breed of student, the one who regularly attends and actively participates in class but never turns anything in, possibly because you‚Äôve coddled them and assured them that you will accept any and all of their work up until‚Äìand maybe even beyond!--the end of the semester. You appreciate their participation in class so you do them this favor of giving them extended deadlines, but you aren‚Äôt helping them! You‚Äôre actually adding to their mental anguish as the end of the term arrives and they are overwhelmed and psychologically paralyzed by the unsurmountable workload before them. If you really want to help them, you need to provide encouragement, support, *and structure*. They will either figure it out, or they will be able to drop the class and focus their energies elsewhere rather than languish and feel guilty about wasting their professor‚Äôs grace.¬†

For context, I teach composition at a cc with a reputable transfer rate, so there are both high and low achieving students with what we might call ""bad habits."" Here are the new policies that I put in my syllabi this semester:

**Late work**

* Low stakes assignments (mostly discussion posts and reading response): no later than one week past the deadline for half credit
* Major essay assignments: a single-use late pass good for 72 hours. Otherwise, 11 point deduction from a 100-point assignment (meaning no A possible) the first day, and 5 points deducted each day thereafter

**Attendance**

* 2 permitted absences, no questions asked. Third absence results in 5% deduction from overall grade. The deduction doubles with each additional absence. So a fourth absence makes it nearly impossible to get an A, and a sixth absence results in a failing grade.¬†

**Tardiness**

* I take attendance at the beginning of class. If a student arrives after I‚Äôve gone through the roster, then I mark them as late. After they‚Äôve been late 3 times, all additional late arrivals will still be recorded as absences and will count toward the attendance policy.

It is not in my nature to be this strict, but I felt that it was what my students needed after 4 years of (warranted) unlimited grace. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt do this last semester, maybe even last year.

**TL;DR**

Get stricter with your attendance and late work policies! You and your students will benefit from it.¬†¬†¬†

P.S. Yes, I am posting this as a form of procrastination to avoid the finals I need to get back to grading.

1h1gnuv,International students feeling anxiety about the upcoming administration,"Last week, I had an interesting conversation with our international student recruiter.

11e836r,Heartbroken and seeking clarity,"I figured I post here because I was lurking on this subreddit for a while to learn and saw a lot of posts about the difficulties of relationships.

I was in a long-distance relationship with a med student and made an effort to understand her busy schedule. I even browsed the subreddit every day to learn and understand. However, the lack of quality time together basically caused me to have attachment anxiety. I slowly addressed what I needed so I didn't cause unwanted pressure. I even mentioned that I had a lot of free time so whenever she was free and wanted to chat, she could call and FaceTime whenever. Eventually, when I didn't get anything, we had to schedule it instead. We did manage to schedule a FaceTime call once a week, not enough, but it was better than going months or weeks without one like before. We even spent time together in person during winter break and there was no sign of anything wrong. All was good until she had to move back because of the start of the semester. Again, I tried to understand and thought I could take it temporarily because classes, matching, and boards were causing her some major anxiety and stress.

A couple of days before, she seemed aggressive and mean through text. That continued the next day, and she seemed quieter than usual, so I asked her why she was quiet and if everything was good (my anxious attachment acting up). She lashed out again and told me that she was dying from studying, as usual. It just felt like she was saying I didn't understand her without saying it directly. Like I knew she was studying but just wanted to check up on her because it was causing me anxiety. I did something similar months before, but it was not as bad, and we clarified the misunderstanding because it is really hard to tell through text. Then the breakup text came right after.

The breakup came all of a sudden because even though she had told me how much she was stressed, she did not communicate the potential of a breakup. The reason she gave was that she could not meet my needs even though it was the bare minimum. She said she was too busy and anxious after the second semester her M2 started.

I have been struggling to accept this as the reason because I feel this is something we could have talked about before at least. Even if I did something wrong or it was me I would like to know so I can fix these issues. I didn't even get a call, and it was all via text. No chance to talk it out or anything because I just accepted it at the moment. We never had any arguments before, and she never mentioned anything that she felt was wrong in the relationship. I even asked her to communicate anything that bothered her to me because all I wanted to do was support her.

Even after the breakup, I did not argue back and just thanked her and went no contact. I do think it's best for both of us to have this space, and she can focus on med school and boards without unnecessary drama. I am just extremely hurt because I wanted it to work and gave it my all. I tried to communicate as much as I could but never got that in return.

I know this is just my side of the story, and I am not going to contact her until she reaches out to me, which I feel is not going to happen ever for some reason. I feel like I was suffocating her in the relationship even though I just wanted basic things and communication. I want med students' opinions on my story.

Note: I went down this rabbit hole about attachment theory. I saw a lot of anxious attachment in me, while I saw a lot of avoidant behavior in her which is causing me to not accept the reason she gave me.

TLDR: Med school GF broke up with me because she did not have time for me, and I am confused about the real reason because of a lack of communication. I am going no contact for my healing but want answers from her.

Edit: Thank you for the kind words. I am on the right path to recovery and getting back out there. I know relationships don't work sometimes and it's okay to break up. But it's the way it ended that left me hurting.

Edit 2:  I am already working on my anxious attachment. I never had this before and a lot of it probably came out because I felt like I was not getting my needs met. I should have addressed it sooner but I was afraid.

Edit 3: I have come to the conclusion that she felt that the relationship was not worth it for her and ended things. I know she does not owe me anything including talking, giving a reason, or anything. I simply need to move on and let go of hope. Thank you, everyone, and good luck.

Edit 4: I have no hate against anyone in this. I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings. Maybe I was too lovey-dovey and smothered her too much. I just did what felt right in the moment.

Edit 5: I learned that we might have been trauma bonding. I ignored my needs and put hers first. I realized that I made some mistakes where I sometimes blamed her for canceling on me frequently or not getting me what I wanted. I will further explore this with my therapists. I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I was not aware of. I will try to learn from them and fix them.

Final Edit: it‚Äôs the next day! I have slept with everyone‚Äôs comments. I understand that sometimes relationships don‚Äôt work because of a lot of different things. I need to stop overthinking and move on. Thank you again!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11e836r/heartbroken_and_seeking_clarity/,1

1kjzwd8,Are perpetual associate professors really a thing?,"My journey to tenure at an R1 had a lot of events:

My father died.

Then my brother died of cancer.

Then I was diagnosed with cancer. I didn‚Äôt tell my family‚Äîeveryone was already grieving, and I couldn‚Äôt put more weight on them. I only told a small handful of people.

I went through radiation and chemotherapy during COVID. I was bedridden for months. I caught COVID during treatment.


After two years of remission, and trying to catch up my research and teaching, the cancer came back.


Around the same time (and probably due in part to my re-diagnosis), my wife experienced a manic episode and abruptly left me and our children. She filed for divorce and cut off contact.

However, choosing the right SUPERVISOR is one of the most crucial decisions you'll make during your PhD journey. It's essential to conduct thorough research on potential supervisors beyond just their academic achievements or the number of publications they have. Look into their track record of successfully graduating students. Find out how long it typically takes for their students to complete their degrees and whether these students are mentally happy and emotionally ok after completing their PhD. It‚Äôs also invaluable to reach out to former students, especially those who are no longer affiliated with the supervisor. These individuals can provide honest, unfiltered insights into what working with that supervisor is really like. Don't shy away from asking the tough questions about their supervisory style, expectations, and the reality of working under their guidance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Beware of the allure of a supervisor who appears overly supportive or charming during the beginning of communication process. Sometimes, supervisors might present themselves as the perfect match or as someone who cares deeply about your success. It's easy to be swayed when you're eager to secure a position or when you're impressed by their reputation, but remember that nothing is more important than your mental health and overall well-being. A supportive and understanding supervisor can make your PhD experience rewarding, while a mismatch can lead to unnecessary stress, depression,  burnout, and a challenging experience.

Your mental health and well-being are paramount, so choose wisely. No degree or academic achievement is worth compromising your peace of mind and happiness.You got this, we are all rooting for you.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1f1ftiw/advice_and_a_word_of_caution_to_phd_prospects/,0
xdjuh0,Extremely Disruptive Class. Should I escalate to the Dean?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Right now I am taking a very challenging morning math course and there is a group of about 8 guys who all seem to have known each other previously and they are so extremely loud that is very disrespectful to not only the professor but for the rest of the students. This has been happening since day one of school and I had immediately reached out to the professor which he did not reply to the email but I think he read it because the following day he attempted to quiet down the group.

&#x200B;

They often loudly side talk, mimic/mock the professors accent, make unfunny jokes to amongst themselves (making sure to laugh very loudly in the process), and explain the material to themselves while the professor is already in the process of doing so. 

I have already reached out to the professor once but I am absolutely miserable in this class and I dread going to it because of this group. I can barely even hear. I am sure I am not the only student that feels this way because I often look around and see annoyed and exhausted faces while they are being disruptive.

Should I escalate this situation to the department dean? I cannot go through the next several months attending class like this.

1n1ktbr,Thinking of reading 1 hour/day of math research papers for 4 years ‚Äî good idea?,"I‚Äôm finishing high school and will start college soon. I want to build a daily habit: **1 hour every day reading math research papers** (surveys, short notes, full papers) for the next 4 years. I don‚Äôt want strict deadlines or throughput targets (e.g., ‚Äúfinish 1 paper in X days‚Äù). My plan is simply: sit with a paper for one hour each day, try to understand as much as possible, take notes, and only set stricter goals once I‚Äôm more competent.

A few things I‚Äôm curious about::

* What will I actually be able to do after 4 years of this?
* Is 1 hour/day sustainable long-term or should I change the rhythm?
* Should I start with surveys/short papers or dive into full research articles immediately?
* Focus broadly across fields or pick one area by year 2‚Äì3?
* Realistic checkpoints at 6 months / 1 year / 2 years / 4 years?
* When could I reasonably expect to contribute to research (coauthor, reproduce+improve results, write an expository note)?
* Best way to approach professors or grad students for mentorship?
* Common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid burnout or getting stuck?
* Any tools/workflows that made a big difference for you?

Thanks!

1j0o8t2,Do I hate college or do I hate my major?,"Context: When I was in high school, I LOVED school. I loved learning, I loved doing hard things, and I performed pretty well. Of course, I had subjects I struggled in, but it always seemed to work out and I graduated in the top 5% of my class. I balanced a lot of extracurriculars, had a job, had hundreds of volunteer hours, and didn‚Äôt have much issue with multitasking (at least compared to now). I eventually got accepted to my current college‚Äôs honors program on a full ride.

When I went to college, I majored in Civil Engineering‚Äîdespite the fact that I feel more confident in the humanities/social sciences. But I‚Äôm not too deterred by not knowing something. Personally, I believe that the whole point of college is to challenge yourself to learn new things. I‚Äôve learned a lot more in STEM subjects that I had no idea about a year ago. 

I‚Äôm currently in my sophomore year and I‚Äôm SERIOUSLY struggling. I have friends who call themselves dumb, but have so much more of an idea as to what‚Äôs going on in class. They‚Äôll get Bs on exams and I‚Äôll get Ds. I attend so many office hours, study until extremely late, meet with my TAs, try to learn from friends, and my grades are still shit. I often dread going to classes because I never understand what‚Äôs going on, and I always feel so exhausted. My GPA has never been so low, and I feel so, so stupid. In high school, I never was ‚Äúnaturally smart‚Äù‚Äîif anything, I think I‚Äôm very slow to learn. I need to work three times as much to understand concepts, especially math-science related ones. 

I now don‚Äôt know what to do. My grades are plummeting, the advice I‚Äôve received from professors has been like, ‚ÄúStudy harder,‚Äù and I‚Äôve never felt so bad about school before. I‚Äôm not even sure what I want to do with this degree, and I only really chose it because of its flexibility, demand, and high paying rate. 

I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt pursuing a STEM degree mainly for financial reasons. I grew up low-income, and am worried that I‚Äôll have worked so hard just to not make enough. I only have so many years left before I graduate‚Ä¶ and I really need help.

1lhvh63,Advice on being confident during surgery rotation?,"Can yall give me advice on how to be confident and assertive? I‚Äôm on my surgery rotation and I really want to do well, but I‚Äôm a high introversion/high anxiety person with ADHD and chronic fatigue. I find it so hard to speak up for myself and try to get noticed.

I want to make sure that the residents and doctors see that I‚Äôm interested and genuinely want to learn as much as possible (despite being absolutely exhausted).

1j33g3i,Massive Leap of Faith,"So, where do I even start.

The other day I just found out I have some serious health issues (my doctor is thinking I might have cancer, still have to run more tests.) It runs in my family, a bunch of women die young in my family from it, I have made peace with it. However, that on top of my insomnia has made me actually miserable.

I am currently at University, but I decided to drop out, and I am looking into getting an online degree. It has nothing to do with me not trying hard enough, I just simply realized how much I hate school here. I have no friends, I have nothing here that is worth saving. I am in one of the best schools for my major, specifically for education, but I just no longer feel a desire to be here. 

There are other things going into this as well. As I live a few hours away from home, it is not easy seeing a doctor. I do not have a car (sold it for textbooks lol,) so the constant back and forth has been so expensive. With my insomnia, I keep staying awake for 2-3 days at a time and falling asleep in dangerous places (school bathrooms, one time on a bench, on my bathroom floor.) I am concerned for my safety at this point.

Due to my McKinney Vento status, I do not even know what I am going to do in regards of transferring financial credits. I am dropping out now, I can't stay anymore. I am probably going to just pack my things and not come back during spring break. 

I'm doing an accelerated course in Creative Writing and English and will either do my masters in education or my state offers an internship for teachers to start teaching while they receive their certificates and whatnot.

Right now, I have to clean up my health and start working to afford a new car. I don't know why I'm posting this, but any words of advice will help greatly.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1j33g3i/massive_leap_of_faith/,2
vw3u15,Things I wish someone told me before I started college,"Since many people will be going off to college for the first time in about a month, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to make this post. I recommend you read everything, but you can certainly skip around if you wish. Also, just because this post is geared toward people who haven't been to college before doesn't mean returning students won't find any good advice here. I encourage all college students to check out this post, and if you've been to college before feel free to share your own insight too!

&#x200B;

***\[1\] Academics- Building A Good Schedule***

* **Get familiar with the logistics of course selection**. Many colleges have specific websites or platforms used to pick classes. Each school does it a bit differently, so make sure you know what to expect.
* **Know the exact day and time you can start picking classes**. You want the best chance of getting into the classes you want, especially if you‚Äôre a freshman with little to no credits earned. With that said, it‚Äôs okay if you get an undesirable schedule! You earn new credits and get earlier pick times each semester, meaning you‚Äôll have more and more classes to choose from.
* **Have backups for your classes**. As discussed above, you might not get into all the classes you want, but you still need to take at least 12 credits per semester to remain a full-time student.
* **Put together a balanced schedule**. Avoid making your schedule too challenging during the first semester or two; instead, add 1-2 interesting general education classes to your schedule. If your very first semester is difficult academically, you can get overwhelmed keeping up with academic expectations while also learning how to adjust to a new living environment, maintain a social life, get enough sleep, etc. Once you‚Äôve been here for at least a semester, you‚Äôll know how to succeed outside of academics and will be able to focus more on excelling in class.
* **Use RateMyProfessors wisely**. Sometimes you must take a certain class for your major or the only person teaching it has bad reviews, but for gen eds or classes where there are multiple instructors it‚Äôs best to choose someone with good reviews. Also, while I have found the website to be rather accurate when professors have many reviews, gauging quality objectively becomes much harder when there are just a few reviews.
* **Consider taking an early morning class**. . Dragging yourself to an 8 or 9 am might seem awful, but keep in mind that many clubs and social events take place during weekday evenings and you could miss them if you have late classes. Of course, if you absolutely cannot wake up early and have alternative options, then don't take a morning class! This tip is just food for thought for people who aren't a fan of morning classes but could technically handle one.
* **It's okay to drop a class**. It's important to deal with challenges in life, but sometimes you show up to class just a few times and realize how unreasonable the workload or professor is. If the class isn't required for your major or you can take it another time with another professor, drop it! You don't want one thing to make your entire semester miserable. Also, if you drop a class within the first week or two you avoid getting a W on your transcript.
* **Map out the classes you plan to take each semester during your freshman year**. To do so, get familiar with general education requirements and the required courses for your major. Most advisors will be happy to help you with this if you ask them. You can also reach out to an upperclassman in your major since they know which classes they took each semester.

***\[2\] Academics- How To Succeed In Your Classes***

* **Read the syllabus**. First, you avoid wasting your professor‚Äôs time because you asked a question outlined in the syllabus. Second, you get a sense of course expectations, assignment descriptions, and due dates early on. Sure, you won‚Äôt memorize every single detail or due date by reading it once, but you can always refer to the document as needed.
* **Spend money on textbooks wisely**. Please don‚Äôt buy any textbooks until you are absolutely sure you need them! In other words, you must go to class and hear from the professor that the book is required. If you end up needing the textbook, here's what to know: Unless your professor requires an access code, try to find a cheaper version of the book. Amazon is a good resource because they have a wide selection of textbooks and often allow you to rent or buy e-books. E-books have many advantages: they‚Äôre generally cheaper than physical books, don‚Äôt take up space, and it‚Äôs easy to find certain terms using the search feature.
* **Don‚Äôt skip class**. Not going to class once is like a gateway drug ‚Äì after that, it‚Äôs easy to justify not going whenever you‚Äôre tired or just not feeling it. The only exception is when you‚Äôre really sick and can‚Äôt focus on the lecture anyway.
* **Sit in the front during class**. Sitting in a spot where the professor can easily see you will make you more likely to be attentive. Also, professors think more positively of students who sit up front since they tend to be studious.
* **Be respectful to classmates**. You're not the only person going to class, so please make fellow students' experience as conducive to learning as possible. Eating in class, talking to friends, and asking the professor too many questions are a few ways you may distract your peers. Refrain from such behaviors, as you wouldn't like it if someone did it to you.
* **Figure out your note-taking style(s)**. Will you take notes with a pen and paper, a laptop, a tablet, or a combination? There are many factors to consider, including but not limited to:
   * Will the class involve calculations or diagrams that require pen and paper?
   * Can you handwrite quickly and neatly enough?
   * Can you type quickly enough?
   * Can you avoid the distractions of a laptop or tablet?
   * Can you afford a tablet?
* **Study your notes after each class or review the notes from all your classes at the end of each day**. Doing so reduces the stress brought on by cramming the night before, and it helps you retain information better because you‚Äôre reviewing it regularly.
* **If you have assigned textbook readings, read them before and after the lecture**. Before a lecture, reading the textbook familiarizes you with the content. After a lecture, reading the textbook serves as a recap of the lesson, and it also reveals confusing topics that would be helpful to go over during office hours.
* **If you‚Äôre struggling with the material, get help from your professor during office hours.** No matter how small your question is, it‚Äôs better to get it answered early instead of letting everything pile up right before an exam. You also start building a connection with your professor, which will help you later down the road ‚Äì check the ‚ÄúExtracurriculars‚Äù section for more on this.
* **Avoid using your phone or other distractions until your work is done**. The more time you spend on distractions, the less time you have to do work. Also, even if you ‚Äúonly‚Äù spend 10 minutes doing something else, you end up losing more time than that because it takes time to refocus on the task at hand.
* **Start projects early**. You don‚Äôt need to complete the whole project the day it‚Äôs assigned; just work on a bit each day to start, and as the deadline gets closer increase the workload.
* **Know how to handle group projects**. Whenever you can, work with just 1-2 people you trust, as coordinating schedules with fewer people is easier and it's less likely you'll have to deal with a terrible group member. Make a group chat with all group members and get in touch with each other soon after the project is assigned to discuss responsibilities and a list of deadlines. Even if you don't get to work on the project yet, having these expectations upfront will help later down the road. Whenever possible, make sure you can all work on the project without needing to meet at the same time. If it is necessary to meet at the same time, at least try to do it via Zoom so people don't have to worry about making it to a certain location at a certain time. Use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com) to figure out when the most people are available! Once you have gotten together with the group, use your time together wisely by getting to work right away. Many people fear group work because it becomes a bad experience whenever certain members refuse to do their fair share of the work. Definitely try to reason with such members first, but if they don't budge or are unresponsive to communication in general, don't be afraid to ask the professor for help.
* **Always do the extra credit**. Even if you're doing well in the class now, there might be a tough assignment or exam later in the semester that lowers your grade.
* **Make at least one friend in your major**. That way you can support each other academically. Reviewing material together is often more enjoyable and can help you truly grasp the content by ‚Äúteaching‚Äù it to someone else.
* **Let your professor know about any personal issues going on in your life**. If you (or a loved one) are going through mental or physical health issues, are in a tough spot financially, etc. let your professor know. Even though they can't help directly, they'll be more understanding when you don‚Äôt submit the best work or need extra time to complete assignments.
* **Keep in touch with your advisor.** Some people might show up at college knowing exactly what they want and how to get there, but most students still need some type of guidance. Talk with your advisor about how classes are going, what activities you want to get involved with, what you want to do after graduation, etc. Advisors can give you practical advice about these topics, especially if you reach out to them early.
* **Check out academic support resources offered by the university**. Depending on the university you attend, there may be centers that provide general study tips, math help, writing help, and so on. Ask your advisor what services your college offers. They‚Äôre ‚Äúfree‚Äù because you pay tuition ‚Äì use them!

&#x200B;

***\[3\] Organization & Time Management***

* **Find out where each class is located in advance**. Instead of scrambling to find your class on the first day, walk the campus the day before to learn how to get to each building and room. Pay attention to long it takes to get from one location to another so you know when to leave to get to your destination on time. This is especially helpful if your campus is big!
* **Get around campus efficiently**. If your dorm is far from most classes, don‚Äôt come back until the end of the day; instead, find spots to study close to your classes. This is particularly useful when the weather is bad and you want to spend as little time outside as possible. Also, even if your campus has buses, actually using one tends to be inefficient because you‚Äôll probably spend more time waiting for it than it takes to get to your destination. Save the bus for bad weather when it‚Äôs not practical to walk to class.
* **Use a digital calendar and to-do list**. Google Calendar can be used to mark academic events (e.g. when you have class, assignment due dates, exam dates) and non-academic events (e.g. work, clubs, social events). Reminder apps such as Todoist are great for smaller tasks we tend to forget if they aren‚Äôt written down, such as making a phone call. I know iPhones have a designated Reminder app and I‚Äôm sure other smartphones do too, but I prefer Todoist because it has more features, such as allowing you to create subtasks within a task.
* **Avoid having unreasonably high expectations for what you can accomplish in a day**. It‚Äôs better to put fewer tasks on your to-do list and add more, rather than add too many and get upset if you can‚Äôt get everything done. Maybe you would love to study for three tests, work a 5-hour shift, hang out with friends, go to the gym, and attend a club meeting all in one day, but this might not be possible. Learn to prioritize what needs to get done.
* **Stay disciplined**. Although some aspects of your schedule like classes or work shifts are set in stone, you‚Äôll still find ‚Äúempty‚Äù blocks of time on weekdays. Make sure you use this unstructured time wisely by designating it for important tasks like studying. That way, you can get work done efficiently and then have the weekend to rest, hang out with friends, or review the material.
* **Keep your physical workspace neat.** Focusing on your studies is challenging when your desk is filled with things that are irrelevant to what you‚Äôre doing at the moment. We often place items on our desk when we‚Äôre lazy or don‚Äôt know what to do with it, so start being mindful of this. When you put something on your desk, always ask yourself if there‚Äôs any better place it could go. I know dorm space is often limited, but just try your best!
* **Organize your computer.** Even though there it‚Äôs not physical clutter, having a disorganized computer still makes productivity difficult. Avoid having too many unread emails, place important emails in designated folders, save bookmarks for commonly-used websites, create folders for each class you‚Äôre taking, keep your desktop neat, and so on. 

&#x200B;

***\[4\] Dorm Life***

* S**tart making a college dorm supply list early**. It can be overwhelming to figure out what you really need for your dorm. To minimize the stress, start creating a packing list at least a few weeks before you leave, writing down some of the most essential items to bring. To do so, check out packing lists online and see what things are listed repeatedly. Then, go about your days and take note of everything you use on a daily or otherwise regular basis. Also consider what problems you might run into at college and what supplies you would need in such cases ‚Äì for example, what will you do if you get sick, when it gets cold outside, etc.?
* **Be a respectful roommate**. Even if you don‚Äôt do unequivocally bad things like bringing unannounced guests or turning the room into a pigsty, your habits may still annoy someone else. For example, if you like calling friends or family in the room often, some people find it distracting. Ask your roommate what they don‚Äôt like and try your best to accommodate their needs within reason.
* **It‚Äôs okay not to be best friends with your roommate as long as you get along**. In fact, it‚Äôs better not to be super close so you have the motivation to branch out and make new friends.
* **Always try to sort out conflicts with your roommate before escalating things to the RA**. Many roommate disagreements are minor enough to be sorted out between the roommates. By doing so, you learn how to deal with interpersonal conflict, which is an important life skill.
* **Your RA is not just there to help you with roommate issues.** RAs receive extensive training on how to help peers have a successful experience on campus, so reach out to them if you‚Äôre feeling homesick, having a hard time making friends, struggling academically, etc. Even if they can‚Äôt help you directly, they will find the best resources for your situation.
* **Don‚Äôt sit in your room all day**. It might be easy to spend time in your room whenever you don‚Äôt have class, but it prevents you from exploring all that campus has to offer. Also, your roommate may need personal space sometimes and that isn‚Äôt possible if you‚Äôre always around.
* **Do laundry when things aren‚Äôt too busy.** Laundry rooms tend to be pretty empty when most people are sleeping (early in the morning), afternoons at the start of the week (Mon, Tues), and when people are going out (Friday or Saturday night). On the other hand, afternoons at the end of the week and Sundays are generally busy. It‚Äôs also a good idea to scope out your specific laundry room to see when it‚Äôs the most or least busy. Another tip: stay in your dorm while you do laundry to catch up on homework or perhaps tidy your room since you‚Äôre already in the cleaning mindset!
* **Always take your keys and lock the door**. Do this whether you‚Äôre going to the bathroom for a few minutes or will be gone the whole day. The people on your floor may be perfectly trustworthy, but you never know for sure.
* **Decorate your room at least a little bit**. Even putting up a tapestry or some fairy lights will help make your space more cozy and relaxing.
* **Don‚Äôt go home every weekend or call your family all the time**. College is meant to be a stepping stone to living completely alone. Make sure you can be without your family while you still have thousands of people around you for support.

&#x200B;

***\[5\] Extracurriculars***

* **Start making connections with professors as soon as you can**. You can do so by participating in class, asking follow-up questions after class, and asking them about their research. Knowing at least 2-3 professors well can provide you with quality job references and strong recommendation letters for grad programs and/or scholarships.
* **Get involved in a professional and just-for-fun experience ‚Äì at least one of each**. Professional experiences include research or a job/internship related to your major. Having this under your belt allows you to obtain valuable experiences and soft skills you can discuss in an interview. Just-for-fun experiences include clubs or intramural sports. These allow you to take a break from school while doing something enjoyable and making friends.
* **Sign up for a bunch of clubs at the start of the semester**. Join the email list for each club that sounds remotely interesting, and then you can decide whether you truly have an interest in that activity or are free when meetings are held.
* **Get a part-time job on campus**. There are many benefits to working: You have money to spend on ‚Äúfun‚Äù things like going out or ordering things online, can start saving for the future, and improve your time management skills by balancing work with school. I recommend doing no more than 10-15 hours a week, though it‚Äôs possible you have such a busy schedule that you can‚Äôt work at all. As far as getting a job, most colleges have a portal with on-campus job listings ‚Äì find out how to access and use it. Many students end up at a dining hall or do some type of office/administrative work. Generally speaking, dining hall jobs are easier to get but require more hard work, while office/administrative jobs are harder to get but give you some time to catch up on homework. A few tips for getting a job: If you don't get an invitation to interview within a few weeks of submitting your application and there was a contact person listed on the job description, follow up with them. Since many people don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôll make you stand out. Also, many colleges offer resume critiques and practice interviews that make you a better applicant, so find out how to access this help.

&#x200B;

***\[6\] Social Life***

* **Take advantage of the first few weeks during the semester when everyone is looking to make friends**. If you see someone sitting alone in the dining hall, ask them if they‚Äôd like some company. If your dorm has common areas where people hang out, chat with someone there. If you arrive to class early and see a classmate, strike up a conversation with them. Whenever you come across situations like these, ask the person their name, their major, where they‚Äôre from, how they‚Äôve spent their time at college so far, etc. Then invite them to join you the next time you go to the dining hall, library, or another public space on campus. If you were friendly during the initial interaction, they are likely to say yes.
* **Say yes if anyone offers to hang out**. Even if you don‚Äôt like them at first, they might end up being really nice! This is particularly important if you don‚Äôt know many people yet.
* **Be prepared for unique opportunities to make friends**. Being in the same major, class, or club are excellent ways to meet new people, but they‚Äôre not the only ones! To use a personal example, once I got locked out of my room and couldn‚Äôt text my roommate since my phone was still in there. I ended up borrowing the phone of a girl in my dorm lounge and we became friends.
* **Don‚Äôt let your past social life set you back**. Even if you were socially awkward or disliked in high school, you now have a fresh start! There‚Äôs no way everyone can know each other, especially if it‚Äôs a big campus, meaning you won‚Äôt have the reputation you did back in your hometown. Even if you end up not clicking with someone, there are plenty of other people to meet. Likewise, if you were embarrassed about your interests or personality back then, keep in mind that college is a much more diverse place so almost everyone can find like-minded people to connect with.
* **Once you establish some friendships, make plans with someone at least once a week**. Whether you grab food, study, or go to an event, it‚Äôs important to have some type of regular social support. With that being said‚Ä¶
* **It‚Äôs perfectly okay to be alone in college sometimes**. No one will judge you for eating alone at the dining hall or walking to class by yourself. In fact, spending time alone is great for personal growth and ensures you don‚Äôt rely on others for all your happiness. 
* **Quality over quantity**. This saying holds true for many things in life. In this case, a few friends who‚Äôll be there for you in times of need is better than 20 fake friends.
* **Be smart with your money.** Going out or ordering delivery with friends is fun but try to keep it as a reward rather than a weekly (or even more often) occurrence. Also, consider getting a credit card to start building credit, as long as you‚Äôre responsible with it and avoid debt! Tell yourself that the credit card is just like a debit card, otherwise you'll fall into the mindset that it's ""free"" money.

&#x200B;

***\[7\] Health & Wellness***

* **Get enough sleep**. Health experts recommend getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night, but if this isn't possible try to get 7 hours, or 6 at the very least. Sleep is so important for mental and physical health, and it leads to better academic performance. People who get enough sleep usually find it easier to learn new information and review old information. Though some people seem to get by just fine when they pull all-nighters, for the vast majority of people getting adequate sleep is the best way to do well academically.
* **Try to eat 3 balanced meals a day**. If you don‚Äôt have time for breakfast in the dining hall, at least have snacks you can eat before you head to class. For lunch, eat a meal that includes carbs (ex. rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) and veggies. For dinner, eat some carbs and veggies, plus some protein (ex. chicken, fish, beans). I know it‚Äôs tempting to just eat grilled cheese and burgers, but that should be an occasional treat rather than a daily occurrence.
* **Stay hydrated**. Drink something with every meal at the very least, and then anytime you‚Äôre thirsty. Water is best but tea, coffee, or juice is okay too. Consume sugary drinks like soda in moderation.
* **Work out when you can**. Even if it‚Äôs hard to get to the gym 5 days a week, you can still incorporate physical activity into your life in creative ways. For example, walk as much as you can, do stretches in your room, run up your dorm stairs, go on jogs around campus, arrange weekend bike rides with friends, etc.
* **Make your mental health a priority**. Taking a few moments to take a deep breath, meditating, having social support on campus, and reaching out to family back home are a few ways to maintain your mental health. Having a relaxing nighttime routine by listening to music, reading a book, or doing another activity that calms you is another great idea, as the time before bed is often the only time you don‚Äôt have to rush to be somewhere or do something. In general, maintaining mental health requires you to learn what works for you while recognizing when you might benefit from professional help like therapy.
* **Spend time outside**. Most college campuses are beautiful and have lovely places to study or relax outside. It really depends on the specific college you attend, but simply walking around campus for a few weeks will help you discover some of the best outdoor areas to spend time.
* **Tackle your fears**. Everyone is afraid of different things, but no matter what they are it‚Äôs important to face them head-on. For example, I used to hate calling on the phone, but then I got a job on campus where I had to call people regularly and my fear of the phone was reduced. Remember that getting out of your comfort zone is about more than learning to cope with a particular fear ‚Äì it also does wonders for your entire self-esteem and motivates you to strive for success in all aspects of your life.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vw3u15/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_i_started/,0
1mp3v2d,Top Tips for Dyslexic PhD Student,"Hi all,

I'm in the 2nd year of my psychology PhD and I've recently been diagnosed with dyslexia (and possibly ADHD). It's great to finally know why I struggle so much with my reading and writing tasks, but now I need to get the PhD done.

1l20aax,How to Un-bury Oneself,"Hey friends,

Need some veteran advice. I‚Äôm a TT Asst Prof in my first year. I got mono last month and am way behind at a critical moment-I‚Äôm overdue on revisions promised to editors, my lab needs my attention, and I have to host a large workshop at an international conference in a week and am not prepared. Everything is late or due right now.

I‚Äôm trying to catch up but I can‚Äôt slug through 8 hours at a time. I recovered for the most part but can still only get in about 5 hours of work a day before I‚Äôm too exhausted to think. 

Worse still, the more I think about the lost work time and the amount of work I have to do to salvage everything, the more anxious and paralyzed I become. It‚Äôs slowing me down even worse!

How do you map your way out when you get really, really behind? Not just preventative time management‚Ä¶but how do you climb out of a hole once you‚Äôre in it? Would love some strategy tips for taming this mountain of deadlines I‚Äôm buried under.

1wd24j,Just starting my second year of my PhD and I hate it. Please can somebody give me some advice?,"I'm Australian and the way the system works here is 3 year undergraduate degree, 1 year honours degree (a research year where you do a project and write a thesis) and then after that you can either do a PhD (3 years) or masters (2 years). I went the PhD route. I went straight from school to undergrad, then did honours, then on to my PhD without taking any sort of break between those things. Which, in hindsight, was a mistake. However I didn't think so because I loved research. My undergraduate degree was in biomedical science, which I loved, then my honours degree was in neuroscience, which I also loved. I thought I was totally ready and willing to do a PhD. I thought I'd love it.

I don't.

My project isn't really working and I don't even care why. I just go to uni every day, do my time in the lab, then come home. Everybody keeps telling me I need to join the student committee, get a tutoring job, stay up to date with big conferences I might be interested in going to, look for scholarships I might be eligible for, don't get behind in reading the literature...on top of actually doing experiments. I know this is normal everyday PhD student stuff that everyone else seems to cope with really well. But I can't cope with any of it. I want to tell everyone to shut the fuck up because just going to uni every day is bad enough without having to do all that extra stuff on top. I want to quit.

Now, this is where I need your help.

I have absolutely no idea how to quit, or what will be available to me if I do. Ideally I'd want to get a research assistant job, because I really like science - I just think I made a mistake jumping into my PhD too early. Would it be possible to quit, work for a while, then start a whole new PhD in a few years? Would research groups even still take me on as a research assistant? I don't have any job experience because (idiotically) I listened to my family and focused on doing well at university instead of working. I didn't think that would matter because science doesn't care about your prior work experience at the supermarket, but it really does matter, and my resume is pathetic. 

The other option is just completing my PhD and then trying to get a research assistant job. I don't know whether that's a good idea or not though, because I know some labs won't hire research assistants with a PhD.

I'm trying to find a guidance counselor to talk to about this, but my department doesn't seem to offer one. So until I find somebody...please help me? What are my options?

**TL;DR** Just starting my second year of my PhD and hating it. Should I quit and try to find work as a research assistant, or should I just soldier on and see what happens at the end.

Lowkey excited to start working as a big boy now, but also biggest fear (besides imposter syndrome, making clinical errors, not having time to play Pok√©mon, follow kpop bla bla) is how tf do I stay looking cute during internship? During placements in med school, I always got compliments from doctors, nurses, patients etc on my outfits, skin etc (sadly no compliments on clinical skills), but I was horrified to see that most of y'all's fits dont pass the vibe check. I might have taken an L on my studies but want to atleast maintain my appearance in same level as med school. 

Anyways, with internship starting soon, how do I have time to not look crusty? Chile I too booked and busy to do clinical audit/publication, so I finna  contribute meaningfully to the hospital culture through my cute fits and glazed doughnut visual, so hoping that scores me some CV points for surgical training (jks I actually like myself, so won't do surg)

Do I have to wear scrubs every day as a lowlife intern? Will I really not have any time to do my 7 step K-beauty skincare routine?

1k0yh2o,"Realistically, how much time do you actually spend on your thesis/dissertation per day/week?","It's so hard to figure out how much daily time should be spent working on such a massive project in order to finish it and defend by a certain date. I'm afraid of not spending enough time and then having to run myself ragged before defense. On the other hand, I am also afraid of burnout.

I tried to do an eight hour work day for four days a week this semester, but I found that I just ended up procrastinating and being depressed about how much work needed to be done that day and then being depressed that I couldn't hit the 8 hour mark.  I lasted for a month or two trying to do this, but I could not do focused work for that long. (For the other days of the week, I spent two of them on the research work for my assistantship and then took one day off per week.) I ended up in massive burnout, which is kinda where I'm at now.

Maybe I'd be better off trying for 2-3 hours of focused work per day using a Pomodoro timer? Then I could spend the latter portion of the day working on research for my assistantship, since it's a bit easier on my brain (lots of database management).

1htowf4,The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival),"Hi everyone. I am in the final year of a part-time PhD. I have been struggling with procrastination and lack of motivation for a very long time. Things are bleak for me - but I do want to complete. And I continue to explore ways to do so.

Today it hit me that what would be really useful was some kind of guide. Some kind of roadmap or pattern for a PhD. No-one has talked to me about this and I have not seen such a thing elsewhere \[they may exist, I just haven't seen them\].

So I created this ""8 Stages of PhD"" as a kind of map to help myself. But after I finished it I thought it might help others. So I'm posting it here.

**It is quite subjective** and very relevant to my own experience. But I'm sure others will relate to it too.

Transparency: This was a 'collaboration' with Google Gemini and ChatGPT. They wrote a lot of it \[but I write my own material when it comes to other stuff!\]. This was for my personal guidance, but after I had it I thought I'd share it anyway. Hopefully it helps a few others.

\----

**The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival)**

**1. Euphoric Anticipation:**

* You‚Äôre just starting out. You're bursting with ideas and ambition. The world is your oyster, and you‚Äôve got the perfect thesis in mind. Motivation is *overflowing*.
* ""I‚Äôm going to revolutionise this field!"" you declare, ready to change everything. Insight: You might change your mind a hundred times, but that‚Äôs okay.

**2. Methodical Mania:**

* You dive headlong into research. The literature review becomes your universe, an endless rabbit hole of papers you *must* read.
* Your excitement is laced with creeping anxiety: ‚ÄúHow do I organise this chaos into something coherent?‚Äù Insight: eventually it *will* happen. You'll get there.

**3. Impostor Syndrome Strikes:**

* The doubts creep in. ""What if I‚Äôm not smart enough for this?"" ""Is my research even *worthwhile*?""
* Insight: it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to everyone else. But remember: they‚Äôre just as lost as you feel. You‚Äôre *not* an impostor‚Äîyou're just in a deeply uncomfortable stage of PhD growth.

**4. The Data Desert:**

* The moment of despair: you hit a wall. The data either isn‚Äôt coming through or doesn‚Äôt make any sense. What you thought was a breakthrough is now just a puddle of confusion. Everything seems a mess and you have no idea how to organise it.
* Motivation has taken a permanent vacation, and you find yourself deep in the desert, parched for an oasis of progress. You wonder if you'll ever escape this desert. Insight: You will.

**5. The Burnout Abyss:**

* Here it is. You‚Äôre stuck. Every time you sit at your computer, the cursor mocks you. Ideas? Gone. Will to work? Non-existent.
* Procrastination feels like a full-time job. The idea of working on your PhD seems like a Herculean task. You start thinking, ""Maybe I should just take up a new career, like... dog walker?"". You watch ridiculous YouTube videos. You go on social media. You ‚Äútake a break‚Äù after doing nothing for two hours. Rinse and repeat for days, weeks‚Ä¶ or months.
* You stare at your digital folder with dread, feeling like even skimming an abstract is a monumental task. Reading feels pointless, overwhelming, and painfully dull.
* You fantasise about quitting and blame everything and everyone for your inability to work. ""It‚Äôs their fault!"" you cry. You consider therapy. Maybe you even do it.
* **Breakthrough Realisation:** Stop chasing motivation. It‚Äôs not coming. Start chasing *action*. It‚Äôs up to you to discover the way forward. There is a way through the woods, you just have to find it.
* Insight: If you're running low on mental reserves, you need to *lower the stakes*. Instead of e.g. aiming to read an entire paper, just read a paragraph. Instead of focusing on mastery, focus on *progress*.

**6. The Vomit Draft (optional bridge):**

* You stop waiting for perfection and start spilling every half-formed thought onto the page. It‚Äôs messy. It‚Äôs chaotic. But it‚Äôs progress.
* The key here: **lower the bar.** Forget brilliance‚Äîjust focus on getting something down.
* It‚Äôs raw and unrefined, but hey, at least it exists. And from here, you can *polish*.
* Insight: These drafts are not just a stage‚Äîthey‚Äôre a *strategy*. Embrace the chaos. Write poorly. Write messily. Write *anything*. The magic happens in the edit, not the first draft. Vomit drafting gets you from ‚Äúnothing exists‚Äù to ‚Äúsomething I can work with.‚Äù It‚Äôs your bridge from stuck to progress. As Jodi Picoult said, ‚ÄúI can always edit a bad page, I can‚Äôt edit a blank page.‚Äù

**7. The ""Just Finish It"" Frenzy:**

* Panic sets in. The deadline is looming, and suddenly, you realise this is *real*. You start running out of time, and the pressure hits you like a freight train.
* You enter a state of hyperfocus. Adrenaline is your new best friend, and caffeine is your only sustenance. The ‚ÄúJust Finish It‚Äù mentality kicks in.
* Insight: It‚Äôs not about *perfect*‚Äîit‚Äôs about *done*. Finish the damn thing.

**8. The Sweet Release (and Mild PTSD):**

* You defend your thesis. You survive. You succeed. Relief washes over you, but so does disbelief: ""Did I actually do that?!""
* The memories of the burnout and vomit drafts haunt you, but the joy of completion outweighs it all. You‚Äôve earned this.

**The Takeaway**  
Every PhD journey is unique, but the struggles are universal. Whether you breeze through or rely on survival tactics, the key is persistence. Progress isn‚Äôt always pretty, but it‚Äôs progress nonetheless. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect‚Äîyou just have to keep going. Good luck. You *can* do this.

Afterthought: It's possible to create a visual map from this. It could be something like:

1. The Golden Hills; 2. The Cornfield \[aka The Maize\]; 3. The Valley; 4. The Plateau; 5. The Chasm; 6. The Storm Cliffs; 7. The Racetrack; 8. The Mountaintop. This gives it more of a location-based epic computer game feel, but one which you'll eventually win.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1htowf4/the_8_stages_of_phd_the_real_journey_with/,0
zkh662,TW- medical issue /addictive medication. I'm in pain and scared,"Hi All,

I started my PhD a couple of months ago and things were going well. Earlier this month I started getting a flare up of my sciatic pain (started in 2020). A few weeks ago I ended up in A&E because it became debilitating.

My PI has told me to heal and rest and I am speaking to a consultant this week to discuss my MRI. 

What is breaking me is the fact that, in addition to my pain and exhaustion, the university has been awful about helping. I only need a temp blue badge while I wait for a legal one but they want me to pay over ¬£150 for a permit for the year that MIGHT get me a space within a quarter mile of my office (I can't walk that far) but they aren't sure if they can upgrade it to a disabled permit.

I've been told I can apply for help to pay for it but I need to spend several hours filling in forms and finding the evidence. In addition, I have to reveal all of my financial info to a stranger to judge and justify any payments over ¬£100 in the past 3 months.

The official blue badge will poss take months to get IF they approve it.

I have also been prescribed opiates and I am terrified of addiction but I can't cope with the pain if I don't take them.

I am in so much pain, I am tired and scared, both about my health and my course. I just need moral support and an ear that isn't involved.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/zkh662/tw_medical_issue_addictive_medication_im_in_pain/,1
1krmsrd,I graduated today. I failed my defence the first time around.,"Just wanted to share for others who may have felt as hopeless I did on that day 3 years ago when I defended and got sent back into my program - that if you don‚Äôt pass your defence you can still graduate. 

Story time: 

Did a PhD abroad. Covid happened. Lost my supervisor after year 1 (he quit). University was not helpful in finding a new one. Actually they were actively unhelpful in finding a new one since they set me up with a prof in a different department who told me he would be my new supervisor if I took his course over the summer, which I did and then at the end of the summer when I asked he had his assistant tell me he forgot and had no funding for more students. 

Eventually I was going to master out but my old co-supervisor finally took me on, it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit skill wise but it was good enough. By this time I had already been working on my PhD for 2 years. He was fairly junior and had only graduated one student before me. By year 3 I was out of money (my funding left with my first supervisor) so we figured we would just try and submit to defend. I was also in an accident and really struggling with school and dealing with pain at this point. In this country 3 years is normal anyways‚Ä¶ we felt I had done enough. 

Unfortunately we misread the rules surrounding co-authorships and one of the panel members took great issue with this - basically me and a fellow student/co author on a paper tried to use the same paper as a whole thesis chapter because we both did two very different parts of a project that became one published paper. Because she submitted first it became against the rules for me to use that same chapter, and the committee stuck to that ruling and effectively ‚Äúfailed‚Äù me in my defence but determined that I had done enough work to merit another shot and sent me back into my program. 

It was horrible. Gut wrenching. To make matters worse the committee members were not nice, and they determined that not only did I have to redo that chapter but since I was going back into the program they wanted major revisions to the other chapters too. The worst part is - now I asked to start paying full tuition again myself, no funding at all, scholarship fully exhausted. 

I was so depressed it actually took me 6 full months to open my thesis document again, and for the first year I barely touched it. Eventually one day I had a moment in the mirror where I was like, if I don‚Äôt finish this it was all for nothing, 100k more student debt for nothing, you have to finish. From then on I took it super seriously.. and I wasn‚Äôt taking chances. Over the next 2 years -working part time on it to reduce my tuition costs and working a full time job- I published a new paper for the new chapter and fixed up the other chapters and got them fully published too. 

I submitted my thesis 4 days before the deadline of me being kicked out for taking too long‚Ä¶ 

They thought I did such a good job on my revisions that I was told I didn‚Äôt have to re-defend, and today I walked the stage.

Don‚Äôt give up. PhDs are fucking hard!

1hnstzj,How bad would it be to quit phd after one semester,"Just finished my first semester and honestly despised it. I pivoted fields a bit to do a particular research topic but that was a huge mistake, and the program has made me extremely miserable. My field is also very depressing r.e. the future which has taken a heavy mental toll on me and makes me question whether it's even worth investing the time to do a phd. I kind of knew these things going in but i thought it (a) would not be this bad and (b) the research would balance it out, but the research has definitely failed on that front. It appears I will be working on extremely tight budgets for my experiments for the forseeable future which makes it very difficult because even from the first semester, it seems the onus is on me to come up with research ideas. My co-PIs also seem to have very different visions of what my PhD is supposed to be about which freaks me out because the things they want are very different and I didn't sign up to do some of those things. I think we also have some fundamental differences on how we want to go about research, i.e. i care more about the mechanisms of how things work vs they care about the engineering applications, those things arent mutually exclusive but it seems like I'll be limited on the mechanism front. 

Anyway tldr first semester sucked, and doesn't look like things are going to get better. I would grit my teeth for another semester, but I have a great job offer on the table. Its not really in my field, but it provides a lot of the flexibility and things that I miss (my field is very limiting geographically even after PhD, which is another thing I've struggled with about this path). I'm very tempted to take it, but I'm also very conflicted, because I don't think i hate doing a PhD, i just hate this one lol. I'm wondering what the potential drawbacks would be in the future of dropping out so early, if i were to take the job and then perhaps reapply elsewhere or do a masters in a year or two. I realise that it doesn't reflect well, but there is a relatively reasonable explanation for why (pivoted fields, didnt work out).

I'm 2.5yrs into my TT position at an R1 university, and my ratings for this semester hover right around the lower 3s (on a scale of 5). For the last two years they've been in the higher 3/lower 4s.

I personally have zero problem with this rating. A 4, after all, means ""very good"" for crying out loud. Yet, every year it is prominently noted on my review how far below the department average I am (which apparently is ~4.6). I'm also constantly being told how important student evals are for tenure. 

Just this week, I collected unofficial midterm feedback and it's high 2s/low 3s. Note that this class is very heavily focused on guests speakers, so my actual lecture time for a 3-credit class since the beginning of the semester has probably been 4, maybe 5 hours. The longest lecture (where I just talked), was 1 hour, everything else was 20-30 here and there.  Number 1 complaint: "" lectures are too long and not engaging enough."" Never mind the fact that when I solicit opinions and try to engage them, I  basically just look at 30 faces who just blankly stare back.  Number 2 complaint: ""the professor is a harsh grader.‚Äù Average assignment grades are usually in the low 90s (or high 80s depending on how many people didn‚Äôt bother to submit). Make it make sense.

I want to emphasize that Im personally okay with this rating. Students get out of their education what they put in. But because my department/college puts so much goddamn emphasis on student evals, I feel like I am doomed. Im in the social sciences, and our dean is riding that ""empathy"" train super hard. 

I think all of my policies are fair and reasonable, and account for some unexpected circumstances that might come up. They're not different from those of my colleagues, assuming they're not straight up lying to me. I don't have data on whether or not or to what extent they enforce them, though this might be the problem. I think it is important to be consistent and predictable and barring the most unusual circumstances, my syllabus is written such that I can point students to it to let them know what policy applies to their situation. 

I'm not even mad at the students. Honestly, they're just trying to get by doing as little as possible. I'm just so frustrated that I work in an environment where leaders acknowledge that those who enforce their policies with students systematically get lower ratings and yet they still use it as one of their primary metrics for evaluating performance. I feel disheartened that my teaching ""only"" being considers ""good""-to-""very good"" is going to hurt my chances for tenure. 

Tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

Rant. Over. 

Edit: took out comment about gaming the system and handing out As because too many people took it too literally. It's a rant, though advice would still be appreciated.

Since the post and the attention it‚Äôs gotten, I‚Äôve been thinking and would like to share some thoughts. First of all, yeah it was kinda scary to name and shame. However, in the real world, there was no actual retribution or knowledge of my identity. I‚Äôm still a resident in good standing who‚Äôs kicking ass in my program. Second of all, when I talk to friends in other professional careers, they are blown away by how little we feel comfortable sharing in the medical field and how few rights we have. Never forget that the NRMP, USMLE, AMA, etc are MONOPOLIES. We have to remember that there is strength in numbers, and every time someone speaks up against bullshit in a way that names it, the stronger we get and the closer we get to dealing with less bullshit.  We don‚Äôt deserve it, and there‚Äôs enough literature about how burnout negatively impacts patient outcomes to know that it negatively affects our patients, and they don‚Äôt deserve it.

So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that each of our voices (even anonymous) are powerful and valuable and worth being heard. I would like to encourage more of us to speak out, so if you want to and can without repercussions I would like to ask you to consider to adding to my name and shame big dick energy.

In the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.

By Rose Horowitch

During their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard‚Äôs faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.

They were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.

Last year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students‚Äô grades are up, but they‚Äôre doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. ‚ÄúA majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,‚Äù the committee wrote.

And yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A‚Äôs are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.

Of course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. And now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it‚Äôs confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren‚Äôt so urgent: Can the world‚Äôs top universities get their students to care about learning?



The road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. These overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A‚Äì, became a not-uncommon occurrence.

At the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students‚Äô emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard‚Äôs dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who‚Äôd matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A‚Äì. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.

The pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020‚Äì21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.

Taken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student‚Äôs work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A‚Äôs for excellent work. Others get the mark because they‚Äôre from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. And still others get A‚Äôs because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. ‚ÄúSo pretty much everyone gets A‚Äôs,‚Äù Claybaugh told me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we‚Äôve ended up.‚Äù

Without the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A‚Äôs. An incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don‚Äôt read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. ‚ÄúI feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,‚Äù Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. ‚ÄúThis is the place where we‚Äôre supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.‚Äù

That easy A‚Äôs would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What‚Äôs genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn‚Äôt until I graduated that I, like Harvard‚Äôs professors and administrators, came to see these issues‚Äîlax grading, high stress‚Äîas connected.

When everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They‚Äôve spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. Getting all A‚Äôs is necessary, but insufficient.

This has created what Claybaugh called a ‚Äúshadow system of distinction.‚Äù Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They‚Äôve created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit r√©sum√©s, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn‚Äôt considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. ‚ÄúThere are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúEven volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They‚Äôre highly competitive.‚Äù Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.

Max Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn‚Äôt prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one‚Äôs own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.

This hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.



Now that they know that making college easier doesn‚Äôt reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students‚Äô frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.

Fixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A‚Äôs that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses‚Äô median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.


Claybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. ‚ÄúIf we have the world‚Äôs biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,‚Äù Claybaugh told me. ‚ÄúAnd if the students we‚Äôre admitting don‚Äôt want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.‚Äù

If Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration‚Äôs assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university‚Äôs public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. ‚ÄúWe should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people‚Äôs eyes,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people all across America thinking, It‚Äôs a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.‚Äù",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1n2q30o/the_atlantic_the_perverse_consequences_of_the/,0

**Here's the deal:** I want to dive deep into Computer Science, way beyond what most people do. Sure, I might not end up implementing the latest AI in some groundbreaking game, but that's not the only endgame here. The Ph.D. is about gaining a level of expertise and problem-solving skills that you just can't get elsewhere.  
  
**I'm not deluding myself** ‚Äì I know it's going to be tough as hell. Long hours, potential burnout, and the ever-present ""is this worth it?"" question. But here's my take: even if I don't end up working on the bleeding edge, I'll have a toolkit that lets me approach game development (or any software development) from angles most people don't even know exist.  
  
Am I worried about the job market? Hell yes. Am I concerned about the opportunity cost? Absolutely. But I'm also excited about the chance to push myself to my intellectual limits and see what I'm really capable of.  
  
So yeah, I'm going into this with my eyes wide open. It's not for everyone, and it might not be the golden ticket to my dream job. But for me, right now, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. And if I change my mind halfway through? Well, that's a bridge I'll cross when I come to it.

Because of this, I have but one real question for Ph.D. Students out there: **How has your Ph.D. experience helped you develop skills that you believe will be valuable in your future career?**

d15361,"Not a freeway flyer anymore, and it feels GREAT!","For the last EIGHT years, I have taught at anywhere from two to four college campuses per year, picking up whatever courses they would throw at me, often six or seven per semester. One semester, I taught 7 courses, all 7 different preps, spanning THREE different disciplines (Composition, ESL, Linguistics) at THREE different campuses, ***each in a different county***, all in the same semester. And then I would teach 6-12 units every summer. No rest for the wicked.

I was too often late getting essays graded, and usually by about the 8 or 9 week mark, I would be feeling completely drained. My health suffered. My car depreciated (~25K miles per year on average). I began to envision life forever as a bought-and-paid-for member of the ever-loyal-but-never-valued contingent labor brigade. Over the last 8 years or so, I think I only cracked $50K in gross earnings once, maybe twice. And then only just barely. But what else could I do? I have no marketable skills, save my better-than-average mind and what seems to be a knack for teaching. Besides, teaching is all I've done since 1992; it's what I love.

So after years of applying for full-time positions (TT positions at local community colleges, as well as full-time non-instructional positions like Writing Center Director and ESOL Coordinator) and getting nowhere (4-5 interviews, 2 second round, only 1 final round), and after years of FRIGHTENING declines in enrollment (20-30% drop at my main institution in recent years, ENGL has lost nearly half its adjuncts, they're threatening full-time TT faculty position retrenchments within 2 years if trends do not change) and too many scary, and expensive, course cancellations, I finally went back to teaching high school full time.  My salary instantly jumped $15K+, and I know I am not getting any of my classes cancelled. And benefits. Sick days, Family days. A *really* strong union.

However, I still need money to get out of some of the the debt that my years as a freeway-flying adjunct put me into, so I still teach college in the evenings. And besides, I still love it -- I'm not ready to give it up. I still teach at my main institution, my 9th year with this really great little community college, in a super department with a really supportive chair. I teach a 6-unit ALP cohort (freshman comp paired with a developmental comp) two nights a week, ~20 students. 

With only 20 students, I am SOOOO much more able to stay on top of things, plan, grade, keep in touch with students, etc... I feel less pressure, and almost no stress. I have extra time on my hands, at least, a lot more than I ever did. (Yes, teaching high school is a lot of work, but my HS schedule has a lot of built-in prep time each day.) My college students will benefit from this. And I'm making ~$32,000 a year more than I ever did as an adjunct (my HS salary bump, plus 6 units at my CC per semester), and I feel GREAT!!!

Only 2 weeks into the new year, but I am optimistic for the first time in years. Am I pissed that I never got that TT teaching gig at my CC? Yeah, kind of. I still feel the sting of failure, even though I know [it probably wasn't personal](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Didnt-They-Pick-Me-/151391?cid=cp76). I would have been great.

EDIT: Based on the comments following my post, I would like to reiterate a few things.

How I studied for my previous hematopoietic unit

1. Watched Bootcamp video, took generous notes on the video.
2. Unsuspended the cards on Anki related to the video
3. Did the cards, eventually unsuspending around 950 cards by the time the exam came around.
4. Did around 130 practice questions on AMBOSS
5. Watched most of the lectures at 3x the speed and made minor cards on things that deviated from Bootcamp
6. Fell behind - how? Anki is such a huge time sink; felt I was memorizing the cards and not actually ""learning"" the information. Yall prob know what Im talking about. None of the facts were connecting in my mind.
7. Take test
8. Find out I failed (two standards deviations below the class average)

However, I've been feeling very very tired lately; unable to function, really. And I started to look back at how much I've done in the past 8 months without taking a longer break: I've written a couple dissertation chapters, a couple conference papers which I've presented, a paper and a book chapter. I'm exhausted. I realised I desperately need a summer break - so that's what I'm doing! I'm giving myself a full week of rest. 

I encourage you all to also take longer breaks and do not believe that taking weekends off, or taking a couple days off here and there, means you don't deserve to give your brain more time to actually reset. You're not a machine.

1gqrkcq,Are PhD years 4 and forward depressing for everyone?,"I'm at the beginning of my 4th year in bioengineering. and long story short: I'm just tired. I'm tired of school shit. of academia in general. 

School was a place I loved, and I started a PhD to finally become a PI, do my own research, and be surrounded by a young, curious generation. But doing a PhD and seeing this system inside out has destroyed all my dreams for the future. I no longer want to step into school, let alone become a PI.

But you know, in general, I'm tired of how the world works. Everyone is pretending to want to solve the problems, while they don't. Some basic things are still unknown and no one cares about that. They try to hide their protocols and boast about their results. The least and last thing they think about is a motive to solve an issue. 

So I don't know what I want to be in the future. I'm lost. I was just talking to my PI, and she was telling me it's normal to experience more burnout and mental exhaustion in 4th and 5th year and she has gone through it too. She is super nice by the way and is very supportive. 

  
so I'm just here to ask people who are either already in these years, or have passed this time, is it so? does everyone feel so tired in 4th year? and if you still are in the academy, what made you decide so, despite these issues? also, is the industry any better?

1etj960,I think the PhD broke my ability to work,"I started a new job recently after finishing my PhD almost a year ago. I've noticed that whenever I'm trying to do work that is in any way challenging, I get the strong urge to abandon the effort and play chess (or eat junk food, or do some other dopamine-rich activity) instead. This pattern started during my PhD because I was highly stressed dealing with my supervisor, and my ego became somewhat fragile, which lead to me very often avoiding my research. I think my brain now sees anything difficult as a threat to my ego, whereas before I would've been more resilient to setbacks and unknowns.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm worried I won't be able to get enough work done and they'll fire me. And even beyond work, it feels like I'm struggling to do the things I want in life because of this anxiety around failure, which is depressing. Maybe I need to just go to therapy.

1j11j2w,My $24k Scholarship Might Have Ruined My Life,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 19-year-old college sophomore currently majoring in Chemical Engineering, and I'm really at a crossroads right now. I'm making this post after failing my physics midterm (still have C in the overall course), so I might not be thinking straight but I'm on the verge of dropping out. This semester has been a nightmare. Sorry for the length.

A little backstory, I got an almost full ride (full tuition for 4yrs, a year of free housing, and an additional $500 a semester) along with an outside scholarship that gives $3000 a semester as long as I stick with engineering. However, a dangerous roommate situation severely impacted my GPA and academic performance, nearly causing me to lose these. I was put on probation last semester, I got a 3.2 GPA after being on probation (and moving to a studio), but this semester my grades have tanked to around 1.25 (A in one class, F in 2 others). I've been struggling with everything from a daily 8AM in-person lecture (after biking 7-15 minutes in cold, even rainy/snowy weather), extreme burnout, undiagnosed mental health issue(s) that I've struggled with since middle school that have only gotten worse in college, I can't speak to people normally, insomnia (but for some reason I fall asleep if I attempt to seriously study), poor financial management (last semester I only ate one meal a day but now I have to eat like 2-3 or else I feel hungry but rent is almost $2000/month and I don't have a job or car).

Since I've already been on probation I doubt they'll give me another chance if this semester tanks. I'm starting to seriously question whether I should stick with engineering or switch majors, or even consider leaving college altogether. I'm grateful for the 24k engr scholarship, but I despise it at the same time. I passed Calc and Chemistry, and I've never struggled in a Biology class, so I should've just majored in that. I was top of my class when I did a CNA program at a tech college during high school. The risk outweighed the reward and now my GPA's about to be in hell, and I won't even be able to get federal aid. I hate ChemE major so much.

The work is hard and requires a level of thinking and processing time that just isn't suited for me. It's not that I don't get the concepts but it takes me too long to learn them, so I always end up behind. Then I feel stupid after the tests have passed because of how I missed questions that I can now easily comprehend. I hate the way my professors look at me when I ask a question, like they can't understand the words that are coming out of my mouth that sounded so clear in my brain. I hate being ignored by professors when I reach out to them in emails. I hate how these motherfuckers act so superior to people just because they're a professor.

I‚Äôve been looking into certificate programs (like dental lab tech or pharmacy tech) because I want a job with a stable, repetitive routine where I don‚Äôt have to deal with the chaos of customer service or constantly shifting responsibilities. Ideally, I‚Äôd love a role where I can work semi-independently and eventually afford my own small place (like a one bedroom/studio) in a safe neighborhood, with enough to cover healthy food (I‚Äôm tired of having to eat junk cause it‚Äôs more affordable). I don‚Äôt want a 6 figure income or to travel constantly or have a whole bunch of clothes and tech, etc. I just want the basics and to be safe and away from my family.

I‚Äôm also considering trying to land an online job, even though my work history is limited to a few customer service positions (the longest being 6 months). I‚Äôm not sure if companies would consider me seriously given my age and the fact I‚Äôve mostly done customer service. If anyone has experience or advice on how to present myself for online roles‚Äîor what sites are best for finding such jobs‚ÄîI‚Äôd really appreciate your input.

TL;DR: Should I try to switch majors and keep pushing through college, or is it better to consider alternative career paths like a certificate program or online work, even if it means facing some judgment from others? How can I best set myself up for stability and independence given where I am right now?

Thanks in advance for any honest advice or similar experiences you can share. Truly any advice is welcome be completely honest.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1j11j2w/my_24k_scholarship_might_have_ruined_my_life/,2

1mcr11c,Masters? Math minor? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!,"Hello all,

I'm a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science at my university, and I'm at a crossroads with my academic plans. Quick backstory: My freshman year was a disaster‚ÄîI partied way too much, barely scraped by in my classes, and ended up with a GPA that I'm not proud of. I've since turned things around, putting my head down to focus on studying and rebuilding my habits. This turnaround has me motivated to set ambitious goals, like proving to myself that I can excel academically, make a strong comeback, and that I belong in my school/the cs field in general.

My school offers a combined BS/MS program in CS, where I could finish my bachelor's by the end of junior year and spend senior year taking grad-level classes to earn a master's. It's competitive (applications due by the start of senior year), but it feels like a perfect challenge to push myself and my curiosity. That said, I'm wondering if it's truly worth the effort for my career. I'm interested in doing extensive research in the CS field, but would a master's give me any edge in job hunting, especially for entry-level software engineering roles? I know hiring really comes down to your programming skills, problem-solving ability, and projects/internships, but I figure the advanced coursework could sharpen those skills and make me stand out. Or am I overvaluing it? Should I just focus on a solid bachelor's and real-world experience instead?

On top of that, I'm tempted to minor in mathematics. I've always enjoyed math (I knocked out Calc III and Linear Algebra freshman year, despite the chaos), and from what I've read in other threads, higher-level math courses can build ""abstract thinking"" skills that pay off big in CS careers or even just help approaching problems more creatively in the long run. But adding the minor would make my schedule pretty brutal, pushing me to 16-19 credits per semester, especially if I pursue the combined program.

Chasing both seems like a burnout speedrun, and while I'm committed to working hard, I don't want to sacrifice every free hour of college to homework and studying. I still value balance, social life, and good mental health. Should I prioritize the BS/MS program as my ""redemption goal,"" or go for the bachelor's with a math minor for those broader skills? Or maybe neither, and just build a strong portfolio/internships? Any advice from folks who've been through similar paths, especially with combined programs or math minors in CS, would be hugely appreciated.

1h516zj,What is this addition and subtraction you speak of?? (overall course grade calculations),"I learned years ago that weighted averages are way, way too hard for my freshmen to calculate. I teach a quantitative course that assumes you know how to take averages, so my (former) go-to when students asked about their overall grade was to tell them to calculate it themselves using the weights in the syllabus, making sure to average by category. Yeaaah, that worked until 2022 or so when sudents stopped being able to take averages, even when I provided them the formula.

So I thought--they should be able to *add*, right? So I switched my system to the popular ""you can earn up to 1000 points"" system. 1000 is a nice number, it's easy to see what your grade is, just move the decimal point two places to the left after adding up all your points. I set up my LMS to do that for students. You'd think there would be no more ""what is my grade right now and what is the highest grade I can get in this class given the little work I've done so far"" emails, right? Hahahahaha *you would be wrong!!!* 

I let students ignore one bad exam grade and move its max possible points to the final. Eh, people have bad weeks/months. The final is comprehensive so they have to learn the content anyway. But without fail students are absolutely *mystified* by what moving the points to the final entails. I tell them it means the final will be worth X + Y points instead of X points. And then I get students who missed an exam and thus have no points from it and have elected to move the points from that exam to the final, sending me emails like, ""Is there any way I can possibly pass this class? The LMS says my grade right now is a 50% üò¢ "" 

These are students who *know that their final is worth a huge chunk* of their overall grade because they *already chose* to move the points from one exam onto the final (like, they reached out to me weeks ago to move those points). The points values of everything are made extremely clear both on the LMS, on the syllabus, etc etc. These are students who could easily get high Bs if they earn max points on the final, asking me if it's possible for them to pass the class. Can freshmen not even add anymore?

I'm so tired of this learned helplessness and the utter waste of my time from all these ""Just to confirm that.... INSERT THING THAT IS CLEARLY PRINTED ON THE SYLLABUS HERE"" and ""Can I possibly pass the class please tell me I can't do basic addition"" and other learned helplessness/risk-averse time-wasting garbage. I can't wait until we get AI assistants in higher ed that can act as reassurance modules for hyper-anxious innumerate students, because I swear a good 40% of my email interactions are mitigating these issues.

Have you noticed the bottom dropping out like I have? I used to complain in 2021/2/3 that students were regressing to the intellectual maturity of middle-schoolers. I *wish* that were still the case.

1h88dkz,How do you deal with students who want to negotiate grades?,"I've been teaching for over 10 years and in the last few years I've seen a massive increase in students who want to argue over exam grades. It's gotten to the point that as soon as I return exams, at the end of class, I have at least 20 students lined up wanting to argue for a grade change (out of a class of 180). I teach STEM so my exams are mathematics-based. It is not subjective. We give partial credit throughout, 100 points are divided into 1-5 points per aspect in a problem and we do not carry forward cascading errors. There is a rubric we grade to and I do not provide the solutions because students have uploaded them to Chegg. Exam grades are high on average due to the structure and grading format (in the B+ range).

It gets super uncomfortable on exam return days. I tell the students why their answers are incorrect in a public space which is uncomfortable. They argue for more points without having taken the time to review what they did wrong. They don't take no for an answer until I repeat myself 3 times. They leave frustrated. This repeats for every student in the line until I am emotionally exhausted, and a bit angry, and it shows on my face. Last semester, this was reflected in my evaluations. ""condescending"", ""fake nice"", etc.

This semester, I told the students as they lined up that going over their exams instantly (like some sort of grading robot who stores the solutions and grading rubric in my mental RAM) and in public was uncomfortable for me. I asked them to take a picture of the problem in-question, return the physical to me, and email me their questions. It has made things better but now my inbox is full.

How do you all deal with grade grubbing? Do you allow it? I am considering making a rule that grades are non-negotiable and just saying no moving forward.

1ludy7n,20/20 Reasons Every Medical Student should consider Ophthalmology,"**Intro:** I'm a current ophthalmology resident in the US and wanted to share some in**sight** (pun-intended) into why everyone should consider ophthalmology as a potential field.

**My backstory:** I too, like many others, thought that eyeballs were disgusting and that ophthalmology was one of the most boring fields in medicine. I mean, why would any sane person spend 4 years studying body medicine just to throw away all that knowledge to focus on diseases of the two balls of jelly in the sockets of my skull that a seasoned optometrist can handle right? I came into medical school knowing I wanted to be a cardiologist 100%, no doubt. In fact that's what I did my college research on.

At first, ophthalmology wasn‚Äôt even on the radar. In need of shadowing hours to apply to medical school, the only available opportunity came from a local comprehensive ophthalmologist. The experience, admittedly, didn‚Äôt make a strong first impression ‚Äî it felt routine, even dull. But that exposure quietly planted a seed. Over time, it became clear that ophthalmology offered a rare combination: the ability to make direct, tangible impact, engage in precise hands-on procedures, and maintain a balanced lifestyle. Once in medical school, the appeal only deepened ‚Äî and the path forward became undeniable.

**Why ophthalmology?**

**1. ¬øPor qu√© no los dos? (Why not both?)**

How many of you heard the advice ""First decide between surgical or non-surgical"" when choosing a specialty. Well, if you truly hate surgery you can stop reading now because ophthalmology is a surgical field no matter how you see it (and while it's true that neuro-ophth or ophtho oncology may be less surgical, you still have to go through surgical training per the ACGME in residency).

What about people who want both medicine and surgery? Great news! In ophthalmology you can have both. Actually, you get 3 categories of care: Outpatient clinic, surgery in the OR, and procedures in-office. If you love variety or want variety in your schedule, ophthalmology may be a great fit for you. Imagine clocking into the same clinic 8 AM - 5 PM every single day for 30 years. Now imagine on Monday - Wednesday you see clinic patients and do some in-house procedures, Thursday you operate, and Friday you work a half day to see post-ops and go home by 1 PM with your entire weekend off? If the latter sounds like something you would like, it's possible in ophthalmology.

OBGYN, urology, and ENT also offer the same perks of being a hybrid specialty but at the cost of a longer residency, worse hours, and/or more emergencies.

**2. The need for eye care is increasing**

Every one reading this will develop cataracts eventually unless you die before they form. Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are no where near controlled in America, all of which are risk factors for devastating eye pathologies that require ophthalmic care and even surgery in some instances unless you want to become permanently blind. Every July 4th, some poor unfortunate soul gets shot in the eye with a firework and needs immediate attention.

America's population is aging. And don't even get me started on the large need of eye care and cataract surgery for countries outside of the U.S.A. Everybody eventually is going to need to see an ophthalmologist. The demand for trained eye specialists is not declining any time soon, especially given the fact that 99% of physicians don't know how to treat eye pathologies period.

**3. The art of the physical exam**

Ophthalmology is one of the few specialties where the physical exam matters before you even get imaging or diagnostic studies. It requires finesse, skill, and the ability to use both hands and your brain simultaneously.

You are analyzing parts of the eyes as thick as couple microns and sometimes evaluating the presence of red blood cells with your own eyes. You can even diagnose a patient without a proper history because you can often see the diagnosis yourself.  For those who appreciate technical skill, the tradition of the physical exam, and the ability to see literal blood vessels, nerves, and microtrauma with your own eyes, you will find ophthalmology to be a truly captivating field.

**4. You are a specialty consult service and can do many things in-house**

I personally see this as a pro because ophthalmology is rarely the primary team, if ever. You are consulted for your help and then you get to dip out of there. Long gone are those long-winded stories about how grandma baked brownies for her granddaughter's sweet sixteen after you asked the simple question of whether she still takes her Lisinopril.

Visits are often more straightforward, focused, and efficient than primary care clinic or internal medicine rounds. Ophthalmologists have access to their own procedure suites and imaging units (OCT, Ultrasounds, Laser rooms, injections). If your patient needs something, simply send them down the hall to get it ASAP. Compare that to some of your IM folks who have to place the order for an MRI, then things get lost in translation or the radiologist doesn't provide the impression in time, etc.

Which brings me to my next point

**5. You are the clinician, the surgeon, AND the radiologist for your patient all at once.**

Ophthalmologist not only treat diseases medically and procedurally and surgically, but they also diagnose and evaluate through imaging. From photos of the back of your eye, to cross-sections of the layers of your retina, to ultrasounds of your eyeballs, ophthalmologists can perform, read, **and** interpret their own imaging without the need for a radiologist.

**6. Lifestyle and Job Satisfaction**

It's no secret that ophthalmology is a ROAD specialty and grants a balance of lifestyle, salary, and job [satisfaction. ](https://www.aao.org/education/headline/high-career-satisfaction-rates-among-ophthalmologi)Ophthalmologists are routinely rated as one of the happiest physicians and would choose both medicine AND ophthalmology again if they went back in time. Rates of burnout are low. They spend one of the [least amount of time charting](https://www.beckersasc.com/uncategorized/the-specialties-spending-the-most-least-time-on-paperwork/), especially if they have a personal loyal scribe Jonathan.

If you like the idea of being able to manage diseases medically and surgically while still maintaining a good lifestyle, ophthalmology should be near or at the top of your potential specialties of interest.

Oh, did I mention ophthalmology residency is **4 years.** Technically 3 years because 1 year is IM. This is one of the best deals in medicine.

**7. Fellowship is OPTIONAL and there's something for everyone.**

Not only is residency only 4 years, but fellowship is TRULY OPTIONAL. Some of the highest earners and happiest doctors are comprehensive ophthalmologists who do cataract and refractive (LASIK/PRK/SMILE) surgery which doesn't require a fellowship.

If you do fancy a fellowship, there are a TON of options: Cornea/Refractive, Glaucoma, Medical and Surgical Retina, Oculoplastics, Neuro-ophthalmology, Pediatrics, and more niche fields such as Uveitis and Ocular Oncology.

Want a high stakes, fast-paced specialty within ophtho? Surgical retina is great

Enjoy more of the refractive, quality of life improvement side of ophtho? Refractive and cataract surgery is a great option

Like the more medical side of ophthalmology? Neuro-ophtho and/or Uveitis fits that bill

Realized you don't like the eyeballs that much but enjoy the structures around the eye? Oculoplastics has you covered.

**8. Quality of life improvement**

Going blind is one of the top fears in America.

This goes without saying but cataract surgery allows you to quite literally cure blindness in 15 minutes. LASIK can rid somebody of glasses or contacts for decades, allowing them to wake up with 20/20, play sports without corrective lenses, save money from buying contact lenses, and reduce the risk of contact lens induced infections (there are many articles that indicate that the rates of complications and infection from wearing contact lenses are higher than that of refractive laser surgery).

Some patients will go blind forever after a retinal detachment for instance. Only an ophthalmologist can go into the eyeball and re-attach your retina back in your eyeball and preserve your vision.

You think transplant surgery is only for transplant surgeons? Well good news, ophthalmologists can transplant corneas from one person to another.

Some babies are born with congenital defects and cataracts which can make them amblyopic for life. Imagine living your entire life seeing double? Great news, an ophthalmologist can fix that issue before it becomes a permanent issue.

From a newborn to a 100 year old patient, ophthalmologists can care for a wide range of patients and provide immense quality of life improvements.

**9. The technology is rapidly evolving**

If you like technology and innovation, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for it. Ophthalmology is a field rooted in technology, lenses, physics, optics, lasers, imaging modalities, robotics, microsurgical tools, etc. People are incorporating AI to help diagnose ophthalmic disease and screen for glaucoma. Lens technology is improving every year so that patients who undergo cataract surgery can become less dependent on glasses with reduced side effects from the surgery. The potential is endless and ophthalmology attracts many people who have backgrounds in CS, engineering, and even architecture.

**10. One of the best fields for global outreach**

If you enjoy helping those in need outside of the USA or perhaps have a religious background and want to use your skills to help the less fortunate outside the US borders, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for that. The prevalence of infections and need for routine cataract surgery is immense across the globe and ophthalmology provides opportunities to do high-impact surgeries and medical treatments for those who need eye care.  Ophthalmology even has a literal [flying eye hospital](https://www.orbis.org/en/what-we-do/flying-eye-hospital) inside of a plane.

**Common Misconceptions and Responses:**

**1. ""I don't want to sit there going ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" all day long.**

Most ophthalmologists do not refract their own patients like this routinely and even if they did, it does not take up majority of their day. Our main job is not to prescribe glasses. It's to diagnose and manage eye disease. If you think this is what ophthalmologists do all day, this is a severe miscategorization

**2. ""What a waste of medical school to just focus on eyeballs"".**

Ophthalmology is deeply interdisciplinary, and many cases require knowledge across **general medicine, neurology, rheumatology, dermatology, infectious disease, and more.**

For instance, **diabetic retinopathy r**equires understanding systemic diabetes control and knowing how to educate patients on the importance of A1c control in relation to their eye health.

**Thyroid Eye Disease r**equires collaboration with endocrinology for managing thyroid dysfunction and orbital disease.

**CN III, IV, VI palsies r**equire full **neuro exams, stroke risk evaluation**, and sometimes urgent **neuroimaging.**

**Uveitis** can be caused by systemic diseases like **sarcoidosis, HLA-B27 diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis), Beh√ßet's, lupus** and requires knowing relevant labs i.e ANA, RF, HLA-B27, ACE, etc.)

**Herpes Zoster** can affect not just your skin (derm) but also your eyes.

**CMV retinitis** is common in patients with low CD4 counts (AIDS) and requires knowing how to collaborate with doctors who provide antiretroviral therapies.

**Artery occlusions of the eye** require stroke workup, carotid US, possible echocardiograms, understanding of hyper-coagulability such as in the case of antiphospholipid syndrome, malignancy, etc.

A good ophthalmologist must have the underlying fundamentals of medicine and multiple specialties to evaluate systemic causes of ocular disease and more effectively coordinate and understand the plans of other physicians that might be taking care of the same patient.

**3. Surgery on eyeballs sounds disgusting**

While I can't convince everybody that ocular surgery isn't as bad as it looks (because even I'll admit some eye disease and surgeries look really gnarly), please note that ophthalmic surgery is highly controlled, precise, and requires extreme finesse and steady hands. Ophthalmologists are working inside a tiny capsule in your eyeball to remove a cataract or sometimes peeling off literal layers of your retina. It takes hours of practice and technique to master ophthalmic surgery and is done in a clean, precise manner with anesthesia. No we don't get a knife and slice down the cornea and rip open your eye. No we don't scoop out people's eyeballs with a ice cream scooper in clinic. No we don't inject needles through your pupil.

**4. Optometry scope creep**

I'll just say that majority of optometrists do not want to do surgery and even if they did, they do not have the medical expertise to both perform surgery or to manage any of the complications from surgery and thus should not even be allowed to cut the eyeball period. Optometrists and ophthalmologists have a pretty good relationship and often work TOGETHER to refer and manage patients as a team. And NPs and PAs typically don't fight for any ophthalmology rights, at least none to my knowledge.

At the end of the day, people are going to flock to a trained ophthalmologist when it comes down to severe eye disease, surgical referrals, and trauma. So no, that optometrist at your local optical shop is not going to replace us in 10 years.

**Final words for upcoming and current med students:** Just take a chance and learn more about ophthalmology or shadow. Consider things you want in a specialty and whether it caters to your strengths and life values/goals.

Ophthalmology is competitive. It's been hovering around a 65-69% ish match rate with no signs of it becoming less competitive. However, it's competitive for a reason clearly. Study hard, shadow, be open to any learning opportunity. Even if you don't end up deciding on ophthalmology, I hope that the main takeaway here is to not knock it til you try it.

You might just end up being surprised. Best of luck!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1ludy7n/2020_reasons_every_medical_student_should/,0
1axok5q,First-year doctoral student- distressed and not sure if I can make it,"Hi everyone, I need to vent/express myself for a bit, and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and share their thoughts.

I was really excited for grad school. I think my advisor saw this, too, and we hit it off when I interviewed up to when I started in August. I sensed she was going to be tough on me, but I considered myself strong and disciplined, plus everyone supporting me said I had the work ethic to be a grad student. 

Fast forward to now, about a third of the way through my second semester. I've been crying just about every night for the past week or so. Mainly, it's isolation, but its also a loss in my sense of self, because I am NOT performing well here. At least, this is the feedback I've received from my advisor. I've been too busy to spend time with my peers to see if this is really the case, or if my advisor is being hard on me, and I am doing fine.

I am in 15 credit hours of classes. 1 hour is a 'pleasure class' which is easy. The other 14 were suggested by my advisor, and I am not allowed to drop. They aren't horribly bad, but it is just a lot of hours. One of the classes is taught my my advisor herself, and this is the most time consuming class of the bunch. I currently have a C in that class, and an A in the others. In a meeting with my advisor, I suggested an independent study to replace one of my classes and make it easier on me, but my advisor laughed and said I didn't work hard enough last semester to deserve a break like that.

I started a GRA this semester, expecting it to be a lighter load than GTA, which it is not. My advisor is requiring 20 hours a week of lab work, and since I am a first year, none of the samples I am working with are mine. I am not allowed to start processing my own samples or counting my lab hours towards personal research because my advisor is not satisfied with the research questions I have yet. To be fair, my research is not doing well, but I feel like if I had more time to dedicate to it (as opposed to 15 hours of classes + 20 hours of work), I could achieve this.

I have an office but I only ever use it for storage, because if I'm not in class, I'm working in the lab. I go home at 6 or 7 most days, cook food, shower, play with my dog, and then start crying, usually. I know I should be using this time to work on my research so I can finally make some progress and have a shot at graduating eventually, but all I want to do is go to bed. I am not even that sleep-deprived, I just can't cope with the thought of mentally exerting myself all day long. 

I receive passive-aggressive texts from my advisor or my lab manager often. Usually every other day.  And I think they talk behind my back, because I will notice they will allude to things that they weren't there to see, so they must have heard about it from each other. I don't think this is in my head. I used to admire them, but now I feel tense around them. They monitor my hours in the lab closely and have expressed annoyance at weeks where I am only able to complete 18-19 hours of lab work, rather than the full 20.

I don't know what to do. I'm enrolled in therapy at my university, I am eating well and sleeping enough. I do not have friends to spend time with, and departmental social events don't usually work with my schedule. I called my mom today to ask her what she thinks about me moving home.

I just know if I give up, I will not stop thinking about research. This was my dream, I made it, and I feel like it's changing me, and not in a good way, and I do not feel comfortable here. I regret not picking the other school that made me an offer. I wonder if I drop here, if the other school would take me, or if my chance at a masters or doctoral degree is gone.

277v9w,What do you do when you get in a rut?,"I'm a twenty something male working on my PhD in a scientific topic where my goal is to spend all my day sitting alone working on my research.

Lately I've been stuck in a rut of sorts.  At the beginning of the year, I broke up with my (now) ex fianc√© and I felt horrible.  I don't feel horrible now, I really feel quite great romantically (I've been dating new people, etc...), and yet I feel the feeling of going to work and doing nothing has followed me into the months since my breakup.

It's the 3rd year of my PhD, and so I essentially mostly work alone.  I've been working on a paper, but to be honest, I have lost the spark about my topic.  I feel my current paper is not useful and don't know how to properly differentiate it from other work in the area.  My advisor is understanding and I do some work, but I've lost the passion I once had.  I have a real problem getting motivated and working all day like I used to, because it's a really demanding field, and I don't know how to wake up and just do it myself without having small defined tasks to do (or even what those tasks are).

So right now it feels like the steps are ""step one, find genius idea, step two execute genius idea.""  It's easy to waste time reading papers and playing around with ideas that go nowhere, but much harder to put pen to paper and work on an idea I no longer feel passionate about, or that I feel isn't useful for humanity.  I know ultimately I should just finish this paper so I can move onto something better, but there's a lot of anxiety that fi I do this, I'll have to work on the next thing, which will be even worse because it will be a follow up to this already lackluster idea.

And as a consequence I put minimal energy into it.  I find myself reading about topics I find truly world changing in an almost pornographic way, as in ""oh wow, if only I were working  on this!"" or ""boy howdy, they are lucky to work on this idea!""  Part of it is my reticence to admit to my advisor that I don't feel like our work is that good anymore, and that I've have to admit I've wasted my semester working on something that isn't that useful.

I feel this is a common problem, but my feeling of anxiety about my work spurs a continued lack of work because I fear I'll be doing nothing, and hence do nothing, which is obviously dumb.  But at this point, starting work seems like ""well there's so much to do I just feel overwhelmed how am I ever going to catch up?""",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/277v9w/what_do_you_do_when_you_get_in_a_rut/,2
1f5pk04,"College as a physically weaker student ","I think that one aspect of college that can be overlooked is the amount of physical lifting you have to do. I'm a pretty unfit person, and 10 pounds underweight (yeah that's really terrible and definitely a huge factor in this but I'm working on it) and just a naturally weak person. My campus is large, and this semester, my classes are 20 minutes of walking from my dorm. I have to carry my laptop and tablet and some water. It doesn't sound like much but god it absolutely kills my body, especially my back. And when I get physically/ emotionally exhausted, I find little energy left for schoolwork.

So I just bought a new backpack from swiss gear that will hopefully give me more back support, unlike my backpack I had before for my first year that was more for aesthetic purposes. I'm deciding to not carry a large flask for water, but maybe a simpler water bottle. I'm trying to force myself to eat more meals even though eating hurts me sometimes and feels like a chore (another problem I definitely need to sort out). It doesn't help that the only good diner on my campus is a 20+ minute walk away from my dorm, and the diners near mine are either very limited in food choice, lesser to my liking, and/or busy as hell. I do have some food in my dorm and got protein shakes, which will hopefully improve my weight.

I wonder if I should start exercising, although I feel like all the walking and backpack lifting I do is exercise in itself. 

Anyone else have any similar issues? What do you guys do to manage carrying items and long walks on campus?

edit: Obviously, for now, before I ever go to the gym- I HAVE to work on gaining weight lol, if I went to the gym right now with my weight and diet I‚Äôd probably accidentally die or something tbh

1mwzv6b,Changing fields: Better to drop current PhD or do a second PhD,"I'm in the second year of a PhD in subject A and I wish to build a career in subject B instead. I only chose to go into subject A because I was having a mental health crisis and not thinking clearly (I became convinced that I could effortlessly succeed in subject A but that subject B was beyond my capabilities intellectually). When I managed to heal from that, I realised that I sacrificed my decade long dream of pursuing subject B for no real reason, and instead am stuck pursuing subject A which I have no real interest in. My plan all along was to ""quickly and easily"" get tenure in A and immediately switch to B, there was never a moment of actually genuinely wanting to study subject A for the long haul. In contrast, if you told me 100% that I would never get a professorship in subject B, I would still want to do a PhD in B just to have that experience in my life of being able to engage with research in it and to experience being surrounded by other people who love the thing I love most in my life.

In similar situations people often suggest trying to publish research in A and incrementally move towards doing research in B. When these subjects are closely related, I think that is feasible. However, in my case subject B is a very abstract area of pure mathematics, and subject A is a very applied non-mathematical subject, so I don't think this is feasible. I don't know that there is an audience to even publish such papers for were I able to think them up.

Hence, it appears to me that there are only two courses of action to choose between:

1. Drop out of this PhD program and try to apply to program in B.

2. Complete this PhD and then try to apply to do a second PhD in B.

My concern with (1) is that it feels very risky to throw away a stable income source and to have the red flag of dropping out of a PhD on my next application. My concern with (2) is that the sentiment against doing a second PhD seems strong online, and I worry whether funding agencies would even approve me getting a scholarship to do a second PhD (my family is not rich).

I would love to hear advice on how to best manage this move back to aligning my career with my actual research passion, and I would really love to hear advice from someone who started a PhD in the wrong field and then successfully moved into a different field.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mwzv6b/changing_fields_better_to_drop_current_phd_or_do/,0
1ljoczm,I really hate software engineering.,"After months and months of applying, I managed to land my first software engineering internship. I started out my first day getting introduced to the office and people I will be working with.

On the last day of the week, we wrapped up the introductions, me and all the other interns were getting a list of tasks and different things to study at home and catch up on. Now none of the tasks had deadlines so I assumed the deadline was the end of the week. So, I leisured away and really took my time. Having barely finished 1/4th of my tasks. I pull up to the first day of Week 2. And all my fellow interns not only finished their tasks, but did extra stuff too, I was shocked and embarrassed. I felt like I was naked in a room full of people, and to make it worse we had a surprise meeting with our supervisor to catch up on us.

I can't describe the amount of humiliation I had felt during the meeting when my supervisor asked me to stay after everyone left and asked me if I was serious about this.

As the days went by, the tasks only got harder and harder, and I feel really stressed about under-delivering. I can't muster the strength to work properly on anything, and procrastination eats my whole day. I feel useless, none of the ambition I used to have stuck with me and I feel like I was daydreaming the whole time, if this is what a software engineering job looks like, then my future is fucked, and I don't want none of it.

I had talked with a co-intern who I managed to befriend, and he was saying to me how he was having a completely different experience. That he's having so much fun and feels like ""he's in his element"". Does this mean that computer science is not for me? Or hell, any kind of job?

18ipc2w,Something needs to change in how we help students with anxiety/ burn out.,"Ok, I heard one too many times this term that students were unable to hand in assignments or write tests because they were feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work they had in other classes or that they are too anxious to get the work done.  I get it, it's a lot. I know mental health is bad. Never in my 5 years of teaching have I had this many students contact me 2 weeks after an assignment was due asking if they could still submit with decrease or no penalty.  It's not fair to students who get it in on time. It's not fair to me.  

I know anxiety makes you procrastinate. But here's the kicker- procrastination and avoidance makes anxiety worse!  So we are actively increasing anxiety by giving extensions.  

So when do we put it back on the student to drop a course rather than bend over backwards and into pretzels handing out extensions? Isn't this the most reasonable, responsible, and honestly healthy way to approach it?  If you are overloaded, decrease your load. Don't ask others to carry it for you.

1j8k97w,College and life is so hard,"So I began going back to college recently but it has been stressing me out so much. I'm going in for a degree in Engineering or at least something i enjoy doing.


My parents were in the military and my mom is Native American which has allowed me to go to college for free which Im aware not many people get that kind of opportunity.
Im taking Math (Algebra), English, and Engineering because I wanna become an engineer some day. It's been two years since I've taken a math class but it's been so stressful. I failed my math exam with a 9/100 which is just sad. Never in my life have I failed a math class so badly even when I struggled, I still managed to pass but this was just awful. It doesn't help that I've been stressing so much lately and I'm dealing with so much at once. My mother passed away back in November (on veterans day...) which motivated me into going to college. But I'm having to deal with college and a billion other things. I work a 12hr/3-4 days a week at Tesla. I've had to work overtime a lot lately because I'm struggling on money. I had to pay my roommate back because I borrowed too much from him which at least that was all finally taken care of but still caused me stress. And then there's my mom's bank I have to take care of, the VA, putting things into my name like insurance (since she had it under her name before). And then moving out of my apartment because the assholes at the office decided to park a stupid golf cart in front of my garage door causing me to park my vehicle in a different spot and not even a day later, it got towed (which technically was the office's fault even though I contacted them, no response). I had to pay 300 bucks to the towing company which was bs. Thats not even counting the dozen other things our apartment is screwing us over for (taking 4-5 months to fix a door or an oven for example). So now my roommate and I agreed to moving out because we had it with their games. I'm still not happy my roommate decided to wanna move out but I agreed and understood his view and reasonings but still. I am gonna move in with my uncle and aunt so that may help. So much crap and more I probably haven't mentioned and it's caused me to struggle in college. I'm managing to pass English and Engineering at least but my math class has really gotten bad to the point I'm considering dropping out for the semester and trying again this summer. I have moments were I stress because I cant even concentrate on a single problem or I just freak out and break down crying. Doesn't help the fact my dad's side of the family has had a bad history of heart problems and heart attacks.

1m48vmc,"Where do all the burnt out, disillusioned, post-PhD survivors hang out?","I know there must be bitter, burnt-out people out there like me, the ones who barely survived academia and now write essays, poems, or long-form emotional autopsies just to make sense of it all. 

I have tried more literary corners, but they are all about softgirls drinking coffee during a summer rain and journaling about drinking coffee during a summer rain with a fountain pen and dangling charm bracelets, calling it overcoming imposter syndrome after getting a MFA at 23.

I‚Äôm not looking to network. I‚Äôm looking to resonate. Preferably STEM or STEM-adjacent folks, but honestly, anyone with a brain and a well-developed sense of intellectual disillusionment is welcome.

9p4lgr,"I want to drop out, but I don't think that I can. Help?","I've been in university since Autumn of 2014, and I have absolutely hated it from the first day. I initially enrolled as an art major, but switched to English with concentration in Creative Writing within a few weeks. My GPA was bad from the beginning, and I've only had one semester in these four and a half years in which all of my class grades were higher than a C. I've been on academic suspension twice, and will be kicked out if my GPA goes below 2.0 again, so that is a constant worry for me.

I stupidly took the advice from my counselor to get all of my core classes out of the way first, and ended up having to retake all of them about two or three times each, as I've either failed or withdrawn from them. At this point, I'm basically done and only have English classes left, but I hate these. I don't know how it is at other places, but here, literature and writing classes are taught by complete idiots (with very few exceptions).

A while ago, I took archaeology and history courses, which I quite liked, and considered changing my major because of them. However, as I've said, I'm a fifth-year senior, and I've already wasted a lot of money on trying to force my way to a bacheolor's degree. In the simplest of terms, I'm just taking the quickest path to graduation. Looking back on my studies, I can honestly say that I have learned nothing of any value as a result of being here.

Employment is under control, I guess, at this point. I recently started a job which doesn't have the best pay, but is quite easy and not exhausting at all. As far as finances go, I'm mostly alright, as I only really spend money on groceries and things necessary for classes/work, now. However, my work history might look weird to other employers; I worked at one job for two months before quitting, then went unemployed for about six months before getting this job (despite applying to over 200 places, I only got these two jobs because of ""quantity-over-quality"" hiring and nepotism, respectively).

According to my list, I only have about five or six more classes to take, but I am completely drained of all motivation to finish. If I do throw in the towel now, I would have wasted a huge amount of money. I know that the money and time is already wasted, since I've spent so much of both on a useless degree, but I've always been told that a bachelor's in and of itself is better than no bachelor's.

I know that if I were to take this sort of opinion to a counselor, they would suggest some option that involves staying in college, so I know that that would be less objective than it would be somewhere like here (maybe). Anyway, I'm extremely burnt out by this, and just want to get some opinions on what I should do.

Tl;dr I hate college but have invested a lot of time and money into a useless degree. I don't think I can graduate, but I don't know if I should stay or drop out.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9p4lgr/i_want_to_drop_out_but_i_dont_think_that_i_can/,2
