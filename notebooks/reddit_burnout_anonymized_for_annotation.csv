1myx7vx,My career is over. What a relief.,"I am starting my 18th year, and am allowed to retire after 20, so I will. In 3 years – or six short semesters – all this is over. There is no better feeling than to not care about my “career”.

I was bullied by “colleagues” for the first 15 years. Coming from industry at the age of 40, I was completely blindsided by how much academia has a middle-school mindset. These overgrown children I worked with, who had advanced college degrees, took every opportunity to knock me off my game.

So I took the bait and overworked, trying to “prove” myself and “build my career”. This, of course, led to burnout, depression/suicidal ideation, and a 5-year stint as an alcoholic. So, 2 years ago, I finally left my department when I saw a chance.

I switched to another department where everyone is really nice, and totally disinterested. They don't give a shit about me or what I'm doing, which helped me realize that I was gaslit into burnout – I was never going to get fired, like my previous colleagues told me (despite having tenure, I believed them). They just scared me into doing all their work.

A few weeks ago, I saw an article online that said “how to build your career in 10 easy steps”. I was suddenly hit with the realization that I don't have to read articles like this anymore.  Yay! My career is over!

Students have never been the problem. It has always been my colleagues. I look back at everything and wish it never happened, but it did and I am a stronger person because of it. But in 3 years I will say goodbye to academia and shop Door Dash if I have to, because this field doesn't deserve any more of my soul.

If you've read this far, thank you. I needed to tell this story to people who will understand. Peace out, homies!

1lrpnvw,First year as a lecturer here. Student absenteeism is hitting harder than I expected.,"I'm new to teaching and I genuinely care about doing this right. I spend hours preparing.. crafting slides, planning discussions, revising readings, thinking through how to make things clear, relevant, and even engaging.

And yet... I walk into class and half the seats are empty. No emails. No messages. No context. They are not just there.

At first, I brushed it off. ""It's early in the term, they'll warm up."" But now, it's weeks in, and the pattern is setting in. The same names missing. And it's starting to wear me down.

No one really prepares you for this part of the job. The blank stares. The unread announcements. The empty chairs. You go in with energy and intention.. and start to feel like you're delivering a monologue to a room that's only half-listening... if it's even there at all.

Most mornings now, I give myself a little pep talk just to jibble in. I don't blame the students, not entirely. I know they're dealing with a lot (work, mental health, family stuff, burnout). I get it. But it's still hard not to take it personally.

Is it me? Is my class too boring? Too hard? Too soft?

I'm not posting this to complain. I just needed to put it out there.

If you've been through this, especially as a new lecturer, how did you manage? Did it get better? Because right now, it feels a bit like I'm teaching into the void.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1lrpnvw/first_year_as_a_lecturer_here_student_absenteeism/

1lf0t2n,Emergency medicine sounds too good to be true - what am I missing here?,"EDIT: Thanks to all the ED attendings for letting me know how shitty this field is. Yes, I'll probably cross EM off the list unless it really calls to me in M4 (which from y'alls experience, sounds like it probably won't)

So I was super into ophtho but recently thinking about EM. Can someone fill me in here and whether I'm missing something here? Sounds like an absolute steal, I don't get why its not more popular??

Pros:

* Great income (300k up to 500k, comparable to ROAD??)
* Shiftwork, can be great lifestyle outside of medicine (40-50 hrs a week for shifts or even lower)
* No call, once you leave the ED your life is yours
* Jack of all trades, get to ""save"" lives and do super cool shit including a decent amount of procedures
* Great for advocacy and helping the super marginalized populations (homeless, immigrants) as well as can influence policy since you're at forefront of medicine. I can work in policy on the side with shift-work (can reduce shifts and hours generally are super good per week) - something I'm super passionate about
* 3 year residency (compared to retina ophtho for me which was gonna be 6 yrs)

Cons:

* I get that burnout is real but something I'm willing to deal with
* Night shifts and weekend shifts (also think I'd do great here, already like to work during late night anyways)
* Concern with mid-level encroachment and private equity but thats also a problem for other specialties too honestly

I worked in the ED in college and found it manageable. Am I missing something here? This sounds like a great career where you can make up a lot of money comparable to ROAD and other high paying specialties. And lifestyle is super great too with low hours.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lf0t2n/emergency_medicine_sounds_too_good_to_be_true/
1kiibcl,What's your grad school hot take?,"current almost graduating BS student, got one more semester for grad prereqs to save time later ironically lol. Mine's a more non trad path, worked 2ish years relevantly, mostly to productively reduce burnout. my lab buddies say I should go for it rn straight outta undergrad. I will not do this.

Here's my hot take, no one should be going straight BS -> MS -> PhD. the BS to MS I can see, but anything more than that is asking for a lot of commitment when you haven't (usually) had a real chance to gain work experience >1 year. There needs to be space between you and school for X time. I just see so much regret along that path.

I greatly respect grad school and research, and one day do plan on hopping back in, but I feel like in fields that are applied, you should think about this more and gain a network and industry work experience. ""Those who can't do, teach"" is so so wrong, but I think undergrads value it more if you can connect to the real world instead of heavily theoretical calcs if you're wanting to teach.

1lujl85,"If you got in during the gold rush, you have no place to tell fresh grads to ""git gud""","I recently watched Theo’s video *“Are junior devs screwed?”* which essentially boils down to “just get better.” As the comments put it, half the video is spent telling people to ""have the passion of someone willing to work for free, while somehow resisting the urge to actually work for free""*.* On top of that, he discourages using AI, as if that’s realistic or helpful advice in today’s environment. No shit.

And still, he overlooks so much. He overlooks offshoring. He overlooks tax changes. He overlooks recruiters using AI to sift through thousands of applications. He overlooks the fact that your competition is filled to the brim with people lying on their resume and cheating on their technical interviews. He overlooks the hiring freezes and the layoffs and the increasingly cutthroat culture that demands excellence for mediocre compensation and loyalty. And most frustratingly, he overlooks the fact that this is one of the only industries where you need to study for interviews like it’s a separate full-time job, because the interview process has almost nothing to do with real engineering work.

The most ironic part? He admits in the first few seconds that he got his first job because his manager liked his music taste. He was able to grow because someone gave him a chance and mentored him. That’s a huge privilege. No shit it’s easier to learn a skill when you already have a job lined up and someone guiding you. It's a completely different situation when you’re facing financial pressure, burnout, and the psychological toll of sending out hundreds of applications with no response.

It fucking reeks. Its embarrassing and I see it all the time.

123rbud,'Rethink the 80-hour workweek for medical trainees',"*Editorial in the Boston Globe:*

Kayty Himmelstein works 80 hours a week and has at times worked 12 consecutive days. In the past, she has lacked time to schedule routine health care appointments. She and her partner moved from Philadelphia to Cambridge for Himmelstein’s job, and Himmelstein is rarely home to help with housework, cat care, or navigating a new city. Her work is stressful.

It’s not a healthy lifestyle. Yet it is one that, ironically, health care workers are forced to live. Himmelstein is a second-year infectious disease fellow working at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital after three years as an MGH internal medicine resident.

“I was not getting the primary care I’d recommend for my own patients while I was in residency because I just didn’t have time during the day to go see a doctor,” Himmelstein said.

Himmelstein is among the residents and fellows seeking [to unionize](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/03/18/metro/medical-residents-mass-general-brigham-could-soon-unionize-heres-why/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) at Mass General Brigham, over management’s opposition. The decision whether to unionize is one for residents, fellows, and hospital managers to make. But the underlying issue of grueling working conditions faced by medical trainees must be addressed. In an industry struggling with burnout, it is worth questioning whether an 80-hour workweek remains appropriate. Hospitals should also consider other changes that can improve residents’ quality of life — whether raising salaries, offering easier access to health care, or providing benefits tailored to residents’ schedules, like free Ubers after a long shift or on-site, off-hours child care.

“There are a lot of movements to combat physician burnout overall, and I think a lot of it is focused on resiliency and yoga and physician heal thyself, which really isn’t solving the issue,” said Caitlin Farrell, an emergency room physician at Boston Children’s Hospital and immediate past president of the Massachusetts Medical Society’s resident and fellow section. “What residents and fellows have known for a long time is we really need a systems-based approach to a change in the institution of medical education.”

The 80-hour workweek was actually imposed to help medical trainees. In the 1980s, medical residents could work 90- or 100-hour weeks — a practice flagged as problematic after an 18-year-old New Yorker [died](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/duty-hours-and-patient-safety) from a medication error under the care of residents working 36-hour shifts.

I thought I was handling my emotions the way they needed to be handled. I wasn't. I thought I had picked a pretty good department, and I actually still think that, but it's a pretty damning thing to say your relatively ""good"" department still displayed juuuuuust enough toxic behaviors to really mess with some people's mental health. I see a lot of people on here posting about not feeling good towards the end of their degrees. I always used to call this burnout, but I am begging those of you who feel this way to look up symptoms of trauma and see if any of them resonate with you. My major coping mechanism was avoidance. I didn't want to do anything at all with my research after I graduated. If you think a trauma therapist would be good for you, I recommend one who works in somatic modalities, that's really helped me.

1miai95,"Good editorial on ""moral injury"" experienced by faculty","[https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/05/higher-ed-morally-injured-opinion](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/05/higher-ed-morally-injured-opinion)

Her language is too saturated in ""feelings-speak"" for me, but it's better than nothing.  Yes, better that we name the problems. Moral injury IS beyond ""just burnout.""   It IS a corrosive, existential injury.   The academy does not itself ""care"" though about our ""wounds"" or pain.  It does not see us as human, mostly, but increasingly, probably expendable with the onrush of AI.

I am planning my early retirement by the day because of different sources of moral injury or distress.  Higher ed  backing us faculty into grade inflation, backing us into smiling blinking and/or ""grey-rocking"" through student misbehavior, backing us into ignoring AI cheating and/OR endlessly playing cop about it is backing us into choosing from bad to worse.  All are against my ethics, professionalism, training, better judgement, morality,  the works.

The forced emotional labor, same.   I know these current shitty conditions of course do not just affect women, but for me as a woman faculty, this is the most anti-woman, anti-feminist era I have ever experienced in the academy.  The encroachment of role-expansion into more emotional labor is misogynist as HELL.    I experience it as a form of profession-wide  but also institutional betrayal. After a doctorate and over 20 years experience I am now to play not faculty, not expert in my field, but mommy, babysitter, customer-service rep, camp counselor, entertainer, trauma-dumping-ground.  It's bad for everyone: faculty, students, and ffs, even future employers of immature college graduates.

These are all roles women historically got STUCK with b/c of no opportunity.  Patriarchy tried to ""naturalize"" and normalize them, but they were/are a result of economic, educational and professional exclusion.    Now, after a world of opportunities opened up (b/c women fought for them) and we took advantage of them, and worked our asses off, we're being essentially stuck back in the kitchen, with the students as our infants and toddlers.

No thanks.   I am pro-choice, and that means forced mothering on the job is unacceptable.  There are women on faculty I know who are starry-eyed into that,  way into the compassion-speak.   If that's where they are genuinely, fine.  But they don't understand that it's a bit they're putting into their mouths that will be VERY hard to get out when they want to re-take the reins of their own teaching.

My mind, my talents, my knowledge, these are what I came into this for.   If I can't use them as much or as well b/c my profession wants me to be a mommy on the job, I'll take my talents and efforts to another set of endeavors.

qlnqv9,Why You Should do Family Medicine - a 3 year update,"Hey guys, [USER] here.  I wanted to give an update 3 years into being an attending as an FM doc.  Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sw9gt/residencywhy_you_should_do_family_medicine_a/) which I wrote while finishing up residency.  Overall I really enjoy what I'm doing and probably wouldn't change a thing.  It's kind of divided into 5 parts, so read what interests you and I'll answer questions on and off for a while.

1. Work Life Balance

This is pretty nice.  There's no ob, no inpatient, no ER coverage, all I do is outpatient primary care 100% of my time.  This means only office hours, and I'm on a 4 days a week from 8-5 type schedule with my fifth day being admin.  Admin is my time - so if I'm efficient with my notes on the days prior I can spend that entire day playing video games, working out, playing drums, doing errands, etc. etc.  Call is a couple days a month and is only over the phone and generally for med refills or other easy things.  I never have to go in during nights or weekends and I have every single holiday off.  I can never go back to working any of those things.  I clean out my inbox every Sunday and admin day and most nights I leave around 5:30 and would say I average about 40 hours of work a week.

2. Daily Routine

I work in a fast paced practice and see around 24 patients a day.  So that's a little over 15 minutes per patient visit.  I do my own charts which is either typing or Dragon dictation.  My staff consists of a dedicated MA for rooming and receptionist, plus organization wide resources like pharmacists, prior auth team, referrals team etc.  In addition to patient visits I get numerous prescription refills, patient calls, paper work, lab results throughout the day that I work on during lull times.  IF YOU ARE NOT EFFICIENT PRIMARY CARE CAN BE VERY TOUGH.  Between notes and all the other ancillary tasks it's very easy to take home hours of work.  However, I've gotten pretty efficient and never take notes home for the most part.  With some inbox cleaning up on my admin day/Sunday, I probably spend around 2 hours at home working.

I see all ages, and do minor procedures like knee injections and shave biopsies.  My patient population leans towards a more complex older population.  While I see a wide variety of things my bread and butter is definitely HTN, DM2, weight loss, CHF, MSK, and physicals/preventive care.  I think the medicine of primary care can be tough as you often are making decisions on incomplete info, or are at the beginning of a workup when symptoms/disease is less nuanced.  I really enjoy the fast paced nature of my job and think it's a plus that I get to focus on so many different things.

3. Finances

I am a productivity based hospital employee.  My salary is divided between RVU's (what you bill during an office visit) and overall panel size (number of patients who consider me their PCP).  A definite pro to this is if something is added on last second I know I'm getting paid more for seeing that patient.  The more patients I take on my panel the more money I make which is buoyed against my desire to do less inbox tasks.  The more patients you take on the more patient calls, prescription refills, etc. you have to do.  With my schedule, I make in the low 300's.  If I worked 5 days a week I would definitely make more money and could potentially hit 400k based on our RVU structure which pays more per RVU the more RVU's you make.  Originally I signed on for the low 200's of guaranteed salary, and then transitioned to our productivity model.  A true private practice gig would probably lend itself to more money.  When I interviewed for jobs I got salary offers anywhere from 155-215k.

Cost of living matters - rent is my highest expense and if I lived somewhere cheaper I'd be tens of thousands of dollars richer.  I'm happy where I'm at so it's a payoff I'll take, but keep that in mind as you figure out where you want to settle.  Also, do some basic personal finance - learn about tax advantaged accounts like 401k, Backdoor Roth, etc.  Set financial goals. Great resources are the White Coat Investor and Physicians on FIRE.

4. Reflections on Medical School/Residency

Even though it's been 6 years since I graduated from medical school I love lurking on this subreddit.  The biochem memes are funny even if my knowledge of the Krebs cycle is even hazier.  Step 1 is pass fail?  That's new.  The MCAT is out of five hundred something?  How are interviews going in a post COVID world?  This subreddit keeps that connection for me and I love a good shitpost.

I feel for all the med students who are depressed, hurting, and overwhelmed.  Medical school was a huge transition for me as well - my biomedical engineering undergrad training didn't prepare me to memorize huge swaths of knowledge and I questioned my ""worthiness"" a lot.  I remember I took a pharm test and instead of going home stayed at the medical school until grades came out several hours later because I was worried I'd have to talk with the professor about failing and retaking the class.  My first internal med H and P the resident was trying his hardest not to make weird faces my questions and subsequent presentation were so shit.  But the training worked and I'd consider myself a good doctor today.

I made amazing friends in medical school and I'd really encourage everyone to be open.  Yes, people can be stereotypical and cliquey, but your classmates are generally amazing people who have done amazing things much like yourself.  Medical school is a unique time where you're forced to spend time with classmates randomly and you can make surprising friendships on rotations.  Talking with people at 3am on the L n D floor or commiserating about the pointlessness of prerounds on gen surg anyone can relate too.  Or let's focus on something positive - high fiving after a great diagnosis, or even just soaking in the enthusiasm a classmate has for a certain field are easy ways to connect.

6 years out from graduation I still talk to numerous people in my class.  We're surgeons, primary care docs, hospitalists, academics, and private practice physicians.  We reunite at weddings, send random texts and DM's on instagram.  I play League of Legends with some of them.  Hell, I even married one of them.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I feel lucky for the relationships I made in medical school and while I know everyone can't have the same experience I wish everyone could.

5. Burnout

Like I mentioned before my salary is based purely on productivity.  If I take a sick day that's 24 patients less that I saw this year, and that can easily cost me >$1000.  Me taking every Wednesday as an admin day is a 6 figures cost, but it's worth it.  I need the time to sleep in and recharge and not think about patients.  I'm pretty sure if I worked 5 days a week I would've quit by this point.

No matter your specialty you have to ask yourself not just ""what can I handle,"" but ""what is good for me?""  How you recharge and take care of yourself looks different in medical school, residency, your career and will continue to change.  Constantly ask yourself if you're taking the time for yourself and how to take time for yourself.

One phrase I often say to patients is ""you can't out medicate a bad situation.""  If I was working 6am-9pm, I don't think there's an SSRI/antipsychotic/wellbutrin/CBT combo that would make me happy.  Surgery residency was never an option for me because of that even though I think the OR is the coolest place in medicine.  Somedays your attending is a dick, and everyone sucks, and you're sleep deprived, and the nurse ruined the finale of that netflix show you haven't finished yet and the best thing you can do is take a sick day.  So whatever it takes, whether it's a prescribed 7am wellness class (joke), career change, job change, hours change, less patients change, go on a vacation, specialty change, whatever it is - find what it takes.

I rambled on a lot, but I hope this helps someone understand the field better.  I'm happy to answer any questions.  One thing I thought of doing was listing all the patients/problems I saw in a day to give more of an idea of what I actually see - let me know if that would interest you.

152fwlj,taking a below-average offer isn’t settling," 

Yesterday at an extended family dinner I had a long discussion with my younger cousin about the tech industry and his career path. He is a 2023 new grad and still hasn’t secured an offer he is happy with, and the stress of the current job market has really been eating at him. I don’t know if I was able to help much but he suggested I post what we talked about on this subreddit (I’m not really a redditor) as our talk seemed to give him some clarity/comfort.

My cousin is a classic overachiever who has done everything “right” when it comes to tech recruitment. He secured multiple internships, grinded leetcode, kept his grades up, and did extensive networking. But in this competitive environment its easy to downplay your achievements when you compare yourself to others, and for new grads in tech it is especially easy to become demotivated when one is surrounded by peers who seem to be securing record compensation packages and cushy jobs in FAANG/ FANG-adjacent companies. It is also important that hard work and determination is not always rewarded with stellar or even equivalent results.

My cousin has secured jobs but he doesn’t want to “settle”. The offers are as you might expect, a handful of local companies and startups. A few with titles that don’t quite align with “maximizing” his future job prospects, a few whose core products aren’t even technology at all. It was evident to me that he was really waiting for those “true” new grad in tech offers, an offer that can be easily be found adorning the avalanche of flex posts across social media around graduation season. In his mind this offer would snowball him to the pinnacle of tech greatness and without it he would be sabotaging, perhaps irrevocably, his career path. As someone with a few YOE under my belt and a senior engineer at a unicorn, he was hoping to emulate my career path.

The thing is, I “settled”. In fact, when I left for my new grad job I was painfully embarrassed at my job results that I almost kept my workplace a secret from all my university friends.

I am a below-average developer. This isn’t even imposter syndrome talking, as I couldn’t even secure a return offer to the one middling internship I managed to secure in my junior year of college due to bad performance. My job prep was also mediocre, mostly I used a infamous book called cracking the coding interview and barely practiced any of my interview skills until graduation had passed. Long months of unemployment followed, and this being 2016, the new grad job market wasn’t even particularly bad at this time.

Eventually at the beginning of the fall of 2016 I secured employment at a small startup in the SF bay area earning 48k a year. This place was truly terrible, and if any of you have experienced working at predatory startups you also know how awful it is to work at one of these places. Terrible processes, founder ego, nepotism abound, work life balance that resembles indentured servitude, etc. Every day was a miserable loop of stressful days in the office getting yelled at by upper management and unhappy nights at home in a small apartment I could barely afford with unpleasant roommates. But I knew that this wouldn’t be for long.

After a year at that place I did what nearly every other new grad has done after they signed an offer at this “startup”. Leverage their newly found skills and jump ship. My next destination after some needed rest was a media company in NYC, owed largely to a connection I made at the startup. This time I was making just shy of 90k in the Big Apple, working and living in much better conditions than before. At this point I felt proud enough to share my achievements with my friends and family, but at the end of the day a job is a job after all. And just like those celebratory posts on linkedin, the importance of the job offer faded into obscurity. I was loving my work, my team, the culture and I thought I would stay at that media company forever. But it was not to be, barely half a year into the role my organization was re-orged and I was one of the unlucky employees to be last stranded.

At the time I was convinced that a job at a “true” tech company would prevent such a future catastrophe. I subscribed to the belief that since the engineer wasn’t king at that media company, this was the reason for the layoffs. A truly naive point of view but nonetheless one I held as I was forced back into the job search. Eventually, I secured a position at a large FinTech company in NYC, finally breaching that six figure floor and making 134k a year, somehow upleveling myself even with my disastrous previous experiences. All cash as the company was and still is privately held, though it has notoriously good benefits. This was July 2018.

The next two years I grew at the company, survived through another re-organization and steadily grew my compensation. But as part of a slower moving team I was feeling my skills plateau and truthfully I didn’t find life as a developer in NYC to my taste. As 2020 hit I took the start of the pandemic as a sign to take a break to prevent burnout and return back to the west coast to spend time with family.

Of course, one can only stay out of the workforce for so long. Luckily after an initial hit to hiring from the pandemic, experienced engineers were in demand again at the end of 2020 and I was able to secure employment starting the beginning of 2021 at a large tech company in the Bay Area, a company I remain at to this day. Here the numbers get a little fuzzy because of not only the frequent equity shocks through the prevailing years, but also due to some promotions and a job function switch I made. I reckon that my compensation was about \~360k in 2021 due to the small bull run, dropping to \~290k in 2022. And finally this year I’m probably in the 400-480k range depending on how our stock performs.

So why share such a flex-like career trajectory? Because to a new grad like my cousin my “career path” seems straightforward and illustrative of the compensation maximizing, leetcode grinding, job hopping, up leveling mindset that seems a core ethos in the minds of today’s computer science students.

48k -> 90k -> 134k -> \~300k -> \~400k

But mine on path and that of my colleagues I increasingly find is the opposite of straightforward. The vast majority of my coworkers didn’t “plan” and “execute” a career so rigidly determined in their college years. Many of them are like me, average people with average performance; stumbling and bumbling their way in their own mediocrity through layoffs and triumphs until one day you wake up with strangers, relatives, and your friends’ kids asking you how did you “win” in the tech rat race.

And the truth of it is, I just “settled” and let life sort itself out.

Truly I have no idea if this collection of thoughts would be helpful, but it was a fine enough distraction for me to put to words during my lunch break. Safe travels all.

17iefbv,PSA: DO NOT APPLY EM AS A BACKUP,"The burnout rate in EM is the highest of all specialties, and this is among doctors who CHOSE and LOVE emergency medicine.

Please do not sign up for a career you are not fully in love with, just to match. I know not matching is scary, but matching into a speciality you are not meant for can literally be life ending. The ED is a special place and requires more stamina, multitasking and cognitive load than any other. I am biased as an EM physician, however these are facts. I can tell you whole-heartedly, this is not the place to be if you don’t truly want and crave to be in chaos, constantly. Please consider your match lists deeply this year.

ruoqio,"I am so utterly fed up with ""grinding"" culture.","I apologize in advance, this post is tainted by a lot of stress buildup and some nasty things may come out, but I'll try to keep it civil. 

I am currently doing a master's. High school and university as a whole has been fucking hell for me, I hate studying, I hate the ridiculous demands asked from students, especially during this damn pandemic, everything is fucking shit and teachers only keep demanding more and more. Students are having fucking mental breakdowns and reaching burnout all over the place, and everyone talks about it as if it's just a quirky side effect of going to college. WTF.

My previous uni literally set up a ""crying chamber"" to ""let out all the stress"" so ""you can go back to studying with a clear head again"". Like, that is the most dystopian, ignorant bullshit I've heard in my entire life. How about fixing your messed up system? How about not driving students to the point of insanity in the first place?

I've been pushing myself through this, and I don't exaggerate this: HELL, just so I could live comfortably. Get more job opportunities, with hopefully better pay, so I can live a comfortable life. But I feel like I've reached my absolute limit. Teachers and other try-hard students alike expect us to study, seek internships, seek extracurricular activities, etc. 24 fucking 7.

I have news for you. I do not care this much about my studies. And I will never care enough about ANY type of study or job, to be spending 24/7 on it. I am violently against this hyperproductivity culture. The fact that I get called ""lazy"" for not spending more than 8 hrs per day studying complicated af stuff, instead of pushing myself to the point of complete exhaustion, is INSANE. I will NEVER stand for it. If there's people that manage to do it, I'm genuinely so happy for you that you're so tirelessly passionate about something, but for the love of God, do NOT act as if it's something normal that can be expected from everyone.

That's all I have to say on this. I am seriously considering quitting my degree because I'm just so, so done. I want to be surrounded by people with normal standards. I want to fucking breathe. I want to feel human again. I can't be the only one that feels this way right?

--

EDIT: so I kinda expected this post to be removed and instead I got a ton of people relating to my story, which is simultaneously comforting as well as highly worrisome. I'm sorry this system is so shit and that we all have to suffer through it. But I'm amazed at the strength everyone has to still keep pushing through. We really do deserve more credit than we get.

To give some background (as I saw some questions about my situation): I have a bachelors in psychology, and am now doing a masters in cognitive & clinical neuroscience, specializing in drug development. Basically, a whole load of STEM. Which I chose because I find it vastly interesting. But yeah, quite the switch in work ethic as I've noticed. Not that I think that justifies it in any way, I still believe everyone should have the right to have normal working/studying hours and maintain their sense of well-being regardless of which field they choose. I also see a lot of references to ""American work culture"", which I find funny because I'm currently studying in the Netherlands and have never been outside of Europe. But I'm not surprised this stuff is a global problem (hence the tag).  

Either way, I'm gonna set some concrete boundaries for myself and project partners/teachers for the foreseeing future, and then I'll see how next period flies. Might quit, might pull through after all, but let's hope that whatever we choose leads us to more quality of life in the end.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ruoqio/i_am_so_utterly_fed_up_with_grinding_culture/
xdkcyk,Why should I NOT go to medical school?,"I'm clear on my why for wanting to go to med school, but I would love to hear your perspective and wisdom as med students and beyond: why would you recommend NOT pursuing becoming a physician?

Edit: thanks so much everyone for your honest opinions, wisdom, and advice. I think premeds would really benefit from hearing your thoughts before they make the leap. 

Also, for a little context, I'm a mid-30s, child-free non-trad/career changer with a long-term and supportive SO. I worked as an ER scribe in a teaching hospital for 4 years in order to decide which medical career I wanted to pursue. I tried as best as I could to take money/family pressure/prestige/etc out of the equation when making my decision because I just want a job I can be mostly happy doing day in and day out. I thought physician was a good fit for me, but now that I'm looking down the barrel of actually doing it I'm having second thoughts given the incredible rates of burnout/abuse/etc I hear about in medicine. I left scribing last year to take a teaching job so I've mostly reading about the issues in medicine rather than living it, which is why I've posted here.

Again, thanks so much for your honest feedback. Any additional critique or wisdom about medicine, the good and the bad, is very welcome.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/xdkcyk/why_should_i_not_go_to_medical_school/
qx06jq,"Breathe In, Breathe Out, For real this time","I remember when my friend broke down crying after our first chemistry exam during our post-bac. I remember how my insides were turned out when I received what I thought was a failing grade on a genetics test. We were hellbent on getting into medical school and we knew the slightest blemish in our application could break us. I turned to a mindfulness counselor, Noel, who I used to know, but that now worked at my institution. We meditated in the mornings and we talked about the priorities of our lives. We tried to let go of the fears in our hearts and embrace the world for the beautiful place that it was. Our campus was situated at the highest point in our town near the water tower. If you walked the long winding driveway up the hill to the highest point on campus, there was a final boulder to seize before claiming you were at the absolute top. I would sit on top of that boulder, I called it High Rock, and I would peer out over the students scurrying to class and I would think about how many hopes and dreams would be purchased, crushed, gifted, or earned within these halls.

But every time there was the slightest bump in the road, it felt like it spelled disaster for one of us. Every exam could be the end, and every interaction could be a make-or-break scenario. The anxiety rose so I that something had to give. So I did the only thing I knew how to do: I gave up. I didn't give up my work. I didn't give up my passion. I didn't give up my drive to be top of my class. But I gave up my control over the situation. I gave up feeling like I was winning or losing, or being subjected to some catastrophe based on grades. I gave up thinking that my life was synonymous with getting into medical school. I told myself to breathe. Breathe in. Breathe out.

Later on, I started taking my signs from the universe. I woke up every morning and prepared myself the best I could for the task at hand. Whatever was in front of me was still a worthy goal, but I accepted that my life course would be dictated by things outside of my control. Many call this God's plan. I call it the will of the universe. It doesn't really matter. What matters is that I knew despite everything  I did, there were forces I couldn't control, and I'd be happier to be a passenger at those crucial times.

In medical school, I saw the will of the universe. I felt its compulsory pull into the OR where I fell in love with assisting in emergency cesarean sections and handing healthy babies to their mothers. I had never expected this. I felt its will when the burnout washed over me after step 1 and it implicated me in a year of research, rest and recuperation. I felt its pull when I saw other students failing classes despite their deepest desires to become orthopedic surgeons. I would offer them whatever grace I had: ""Breathe in, Breathe out, it's the will of the universe. We never know why the winds blow the way they do.""

My acceptance of the greater force around me eased my pain. When I couldn't impress the attending no matter how many patients I carried on inpatient wards. When I couldn't beat a 75 no matter how many hours studying at the cafe. I shrugged and let it go. Let it be. This was the will of the universe, so be it. I am alive. I am healthy, and I and everyone around me are ok. So this is the will of the universe and I will continue to function within this greater being.

I watched so many struggle with their lack of control. I saw friends in the locker room with heads in hands. I saw one laid out on the couch in a depression so deep he may never finish his clerkships in this condition. I heard that my best friend from back home lost his battle with depression and died by suicide. At each step, I tried to offer comfort. I even turned to the internet to meet people who were scared like me. I turned to these forums to try to offer a kind voice to a stranger in need, who felt victimized by the process of perfection that medical school and residency demand of you. I took some comfort and solace in the messages I received from a few people that for some time felt comforted.

Then the days came. Standing in the bathroom naked, twisting my body to look at my lower back in the mirror, trying to visualize what caused the linear bruise across my back. Two days later, looking down the inside of my thigh wondering if I had landed awkwardly while falling off my bike. After dinner, I would walk to the couch to lay down, shifting my ribs and spine to arch to the right to relieve this kind of pressure that had built up under my ribs on the left side. At the same time, riding my bike with my friends and watching their silhouette disappear over the apex of the hill, while I struggled to catch my breath riding the same hill I used to conquer, first in line.

I called my primary physician and asked her for a CBC and to feel my abdominal mass. As her fingers pressed into the space under my ribs, her face curled a bit. She immediately wanted a CT. The bloodwork was already back. I had seen it on MyChart before going in.

""did you see my labs?""  I said.

""Why are you so anemic?"" she asked.

""More than that. My lymphocytes. My platelets. It's all out of whack.""

""Let me get you an appointment with the hematologist and let me know if they can't see you within the week.""

I walked out of that office with a few things in mind, but I knew in my heart what this truly was. Obvious splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and a relative lymphocytosis with atypical cells in a young, otherwise healthy, soon-to-be Resident. I carried the weight of this with me alone for two weeks. While we fought the insurance company to approve my CT scan, twice. While my family googled symptoms and asked me if I thought they'd take out my spleen. While my two little kids jumped on Daddy's belly and laughed and then dove on me and wrapped their arms around me. While my wife silently read about the symptoms of lymphoma and leukemia and hid the tears in her eyes as she feared the worst and was too scared to ask me if I was thinking that too.

Finally, the CT was approved and it showed splenomegaly down to my pelvis. The on-call at my primary's office asked me to go as a direct admit to the hospital. So I got in my car and drove to the ER. They took me in immediately and within the hour my medicine team was there. A young, quiet intern approached me to take my history. A third-year medical student pushed sheepishly on my round belly, unable to truly appreciate the spleen crossing the midline, and changing the soft right-sided belly into the firm distended entire left side. The craziest part of the universe taking its will on me in this way ... is that I had my residency interview scheduled with this very medicine team for the Monday following this weekend. In any case, I'd be in this hospital, but not in a suit and tie asking about residency life. Instead, I'd be lying awake in a hospital bed counting down the hours until my bone marrow biopsy.

Two long days later, I put my head face down in the pillow on the CT bed. The attending explained the risks and benefits of the biopsy to me. I agreed as quickly as I could to get this moving. I hate receiving anesthesia and have many more irrational fears about being put under than I do about someone sampling my pelvis. Luckily, I closed my eyes and quickly woke up - not even a single dream - and the procedure was over. I went home to my family. I sat on the couch while my kids played in front of me on the floor. I waited for the phone to ring.

I've been telling myself for years. I've been preaching to my friends. I""ve been in some cases arguing the point, that trying to believe our actions can completely predict our future and our happiness, is a recipe for disaster. I've been conscious of trying to stay somewhat subconscious, metaconscious, to rest in my breath, to give myself up to the universe. Today I do that. But, today I do that in a way I never have before. Today is the ultimate pat on the back, the absolute ""it's going to be ok"", and the day that I step up to accept my own advice, to let the will of the universe decide my fate.

I'm in my mid-thirties. I struggled severely in high school, nearly failing out and not graduating. Nearly committing suicide at times. I suffered through traumatizing psychiatric hospitalizations. I fought my way back professionally, academically, and personally. I met the most beautiful human being in the world and we started a family together with two beautiful little boys. I completed medical school and I entered the match. And then I was diagnosed with lymphoma/leukemia. They say I should be ok. I pray I will be ok, but for now, I breathe in, breathe out, and let the universe decide.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/qx06jq/breathe_in_breathe_out_for_real_this_time/

r9kwun,US PhD students and postdocs: how would you feel about staging a nationwide strike to protest our lack of fair pay and benefits?,"I’m in the life sciences and am salaried like many of you. If I calculate my real earnings per hour worked, it’s under minimum wage. I can literally make more money as a cashier at Target than working full-time to advance our knowledge of biology. 

Zooming out and looking at my postdocs on their NIH standard funding grants (~$50K/yr), I happen to know that fresh high school grads in the military (with no skills or degree whatsoever) make more than the postdocs. *Granted, this comparison is accounting for food and housing allowance, as well as various benefits like healthcare, life insurance, home and auto discounts, 401K benefits, etc. You can check it for yourself [here](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Calculators/RMC-Calculator/) (data for entry: E2, <2, single, 1, no, 08640.) 

>For context, the zip code is that of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ, which has a total population of about 40K, making it directly comparable to Fort Knox (40121). While picking the absolute largest bases (Benning: 31801, Bragg: 28303) does result in lower pay than Dix, after factoring in the [financialization of benefits](https://the-military-guide.com/much-military-pay-really-worth/), those individuals are still making more than our postdocs.

We work full-time, busting our butts to the point where every single one of us has had burnout, depression, and thoughts of dropping out. Do you seriously think we are compensated fairly for our experience, hours worked, and the mental and physical toll this path extracts? Look at what [Germany pays](https://www.myscience.de/en/working/salary/doktoranden-gehaelter) it’s PhD students. Do you think America couldn’t afford that? 

The economy is signaling that unskilled entry-level workers are worth more than people who have invested enormous amounts of time, energy, and money to develop deep expertise. Yes that’s how it is, but is that how it _should_ be? There’s absolutely no reason we should sit idly by and accept this. It’s time we get together and have our voices be heard. It’s time to enact change!

EDIT: if a strike won’t produce sufficient pressure, then how do we collectively leverage ourselves to do it? We don’t have the money to lobby, so that’s not really an option, and a national effort to unionize would be difficult to coordinate. How do we effect change?

ti8t1q,Hindsight Advice to New Med Students Out There From a Regretful Fourth Year,"I’m an M4 from a mid tier US MD school who matched into IM this week.  While I am thankful for matching, I fell down my list quite a ways and am very upset about where I am going - partially because my heart was so set on another program that I thought I had in the bag and partially because I am less than enthusiastic about the program/city I’m headed to.  I’ve been reflecting a lot about where I am and how I got here.  Since I cannot retroactively give myself advice, I’m grasping for some catharsis here and hoping this helps one of you. 

1) Residency application is getting more and more competitive. Do not fall for the trap of thinking “I just want to do family/internal/peds/etc so I can slack a little.”Approach your time in medical school as if you are dead set on doing neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins because regardless of what you go into, having the strongest possible locus of control is SUCH a valuable asset.  Please invest in giving your future self options because half-assing things in med school can easily result in getting worked to the bone in a shitty residency program.  After seeing what options everyone had and where they matched, it become abundantly clear that consistently going the extra mile was an invaluable investment.  This may sound obvious but it is so profound seeing it actually happen. Especially when you’re the one who didn’t have as many options.  

EDIT: I’m not suggesting that you should burn yourself out.  You can absolutely thrive in medical school without hurting yourself.  You just have to be efficient.  Do not fall for the trap of thinking that working hard = burnout.  The people who thrive the most in med school work the smartest, not necessarily the hardest.  

2) Getting the numbers you want in medical school boils down to a) constant active learning(forced recall) b) having an effective system of review so that you don’t forget info as you move along c) fuck tons of practice Qs.  Anki(and world) is simply the best method of doing this.  Please ask the anki gurus in your class how to use it effectively.  There is a method to it that is not immediately intuitive and a lot of people give it up because they don’t know how to use it.  You will be amazed at your memory retention once you move from passive to full time active recall when studying.  Anki not only makes you study actively, it can organize your system of review so that you will retain everything as you move forward.  You will be become more effective and it will take less time to study.  Please please please give it an honest shot. 

3) Invest in staying in shape, eating healthy, and getting consistent sleep.  No matter how much it feels like it, you don’t need every second of the day to study.  If you do, you’re doing it wrong.  Being in good physical shape and avoiding unnecessary physical beat down pays dividends in so many ways.  

4) Get involved in at least one EC and stick with it.  Aescalapian is a great one.  Also try to get on at least one or two research projects.  Research sucks ass and is a ridiculous requirement for being competitive but just suck it up and do it. If you’re an M1, summer between first and second year is a great time to crank out some research if you can find a project to jump in to.  

5) Ask people in the class above you where to do rotations with the best odds of getting good evaluation grades.  This unfortunately doesn’t apply to everyone but if you’re at a program with a number of different hospitals or cities for you to choose from, odds are that people ahead of you know where you have the best shot of getting good evals. It didn’t occur to me until late in third year that this is how some people managed to get honors in every rotation. 

5B) Third year shelf exams are hard.  Your first one will be a surprise.  Study really hard for these tests. The more practice Qs the better.  Make sure you understand ethics and bio stats. There is also a Facebook page where all the nbme practice shelf exams are posted.  Go through all of them, they are super helpful.  Also be very mindful of timing on these exams as the timing is fast. 

6) Start working on your residency app early.  It SUCKS being rushed to write a personal statement.  Invest in making the application process as pain free as possible. You don’t want to submit things late.  This includes having letters of rec submitted in time and having a step 2 score on file when you submit.  Majority of interviews go out in the first two weeks.  Don’t give residency programs any reason to sit on your app.  

7) Please don’t invest your entire heart and mind in any one program.  Always remember that nothing is guaranteed, even if program directors/attendings/residents tell you they want you.  Do as many aways as you can and bust your absolute ass.  The best deterrent against having your heart broken by not matching your number 1 is to have a great 2,3,4.  

8) Tangential to point 6 and 7 is that you really need to consider dual applying if your specialty of choice is super competitive.  Ex: if you want to do ortho, consider dual applying ortho / gen surg, ortho/rads, ortho/gas, etc. Think about this during third year and try to get experience/connections in a backup specialties as you move forward so that you can make informed choices when you apply.  

9) While your numbers and app act as gatekeepers, one of your greatest assets as a residency applicant is your ability to make residents/attendings want to hang out with you.


I didn’t expect to be this upset about residency match.  It feels a lot like getting broken up with unexpectedly haha.  There’s a helplessness to it that is tough to swallow and you constantly think about what you could have done.  While Life is full of uncertainty and things will never always work out as planned, there is much you can do to be the master of your own destiny.  Or at the very least, to know that you did everything you could.  I wish nothing but happiness, health, and wealth to all of you and hope all your dreams come true.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/ti8t1q/hindsight_advice_to_new_med_students_out_there/

1avzmq6,Students should not have to work while in college full time ,"I don’t know about other countries, but in the US, When you are a college student there is a general expectation that you also have a job outside of school. If you’re attending school part time, or you have an easy course load and want to work part time for extra money that’s all good and fine, but the general expectation for students to work outside of college is insane in my opinion. 

The time demand of a college student who is enrolled in 16-18 units (if they’re going all of the work and aiming for A’s in their classes) is generally equivalent to, or more than a full time job, which is 40 hours per week. The expectation is that you spend 3 hours outside of school studying or doing homework per unit taken. Of course a lot of students either cheat or don’t get an A in the class, but for a student who is studying to the very best of their ability, this is the expectation. So if you’re enrolled in 18 units it would require 54 hours of work outside of class plus the 18 hours that you are in classes that comes out to 72 hours per week. Now I know that’s not realistic to begin with, and most students are not spending that much time on coursework, BUT it’s safe to say that a full time student is busy with school related work at least 40 hours per week. 

The concept of the 40 hour work week was invented so that humans could have time to sleep and take care of themselves, but for some reason as college students we are expected to work jobs in addition to a full time course load. Many students have to work at least part time jobs for money and a lot of them even have to work 40+ hours to make ends meet. Assuming their schoolwork requires 40 hours per week (which is an under estimate) that means an 80 hour work week. I don’t think it should be this way. I think that for students enrolled in college full time, housing, food, and transportation should be subsidized. 

For students who don’t have to work, there is generally a stigma around them being unemployed. I can’t count the amount of times classmates and professors have asked what I do for work and then responded in shock when I told them I don’t work. And they even say “Must be nice” but the reality is it’s just normal and should be this way for everyone. No one acts shocked when a person working full time says they don’t have a whole other full time job, so why is this the expectation for college students? 

I’m busy probably 60 hours per week with schoolwork and classes. I cannot imagine having to work another 40 hours per week on top of that. It would require me to limit my sleep, my exercise, my self care etc to a severely unhealthy point and I have a very weak immune system so I would end up getting really sick. I sleep 7-8 hours a night and I get A’s in all of my classes because school is my full time job and I treat it as such. 

I think that my grades are simply a reflection of my privilege rather than my hard work since I’m competing against students who barely even have time to sleep. Many of my classmates claim to only sleep 3-4 hour nights, struggle to pass their classes, often miss classes and have to ask me for notes, or come to class unprepared and often look exhausted. I have multiple former classmates who have dropped out due to exhaustion and burnout. It’s so fucked up to me that this is just a general expectation for the average college student. 

Oh also not to mention we have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college. The system is completely broken. 

Edit: Someone in the comments corrected me. It’s actually 2 hours of work outside of class and one hour of work in class per unit. So a person taking 18 units would be busy 54 hours per week with school related work, not 72.

1mljj2p,Reflection at 1 YOE at FAANG Post Undergrad,"school prestige: absolute no relation with engineering abilities. most cracked engineers on my team don't attend a school you've heard of or will consider prestigious yet they are cracked.

niche: i regret being a more generalist in college. I will recommend you do harder system classes and not ai ones. this will really give you chances at employment because always compute infra to maintene no matter what the product is

engineering skills: important to get your tasks down, but if you want to move things on a bigger scale you needa be good with people. persuade them that your proposal will work. navigate around politics. although generally i'd perfer just write code all day but given how faang is structured you need to talk to other team owning tools you use and request a change often.

always learning new stuff on and off work, just like college. go a little extra to get to learn another language, another design pattern, etc. I call this ""nights and weekends nerd out"" and I generally enjoy it because I liked cs since middle school and has been kept developing

writing skills: you needa good reading and writing skills. read large tech docs that has complex designs that very senior people created. write good reports to update managers.

meetings: i try to attend less meeting as possible unless very necessary. maybe 3 meetings a day and I still feel it is too much

master's: extremely cracked undergrads drop out to start companies. very good undergrads secure immediate placement after graduation. the rest get master's to delay job search. does not apply to intls due to work visa need. i go to a mid uc and this year we had placements like meta, google, apple, the-cornell-like-faang, yahoo, etc and these are all internationals who need visa sponsorships btw

food and benefits: don't really spend anything on food during weekdays. extremely good medical insurance that you pay pennies for the benefits you get out. 401k matching generous tho i won't see the money until like 40 years later. the rest of the benefits are so-so.

life quality: increased a lot since my college days. had my own apartment. finally replaced my constantly broken car. saved a little on the side. the sign on and relocatoin bonus really helped in the beginning to set up your life.

dating: moved with long term partner. i've heard sf is bad for guys but haven't really experienced. interestingly all my friends who moved also had partners so no one is really single. so yeah date in college guys

burnout: real, but take pto helps. as I become more proficient with codebase and tooling that has decreased.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mljj2p/reflection_at_1_yoe_at_faang_post_undergrad/
1kh7ihj,Took a Research Year for Ortho - Here’s My Quick Thoughts On The Topic,"**TL;DR**

* Took a research year due to ""meh"" 3rd year grades
* Despite strong clinical evaluations, the Shelf exams were my weakness
* Took **Step 2 before** research year → scored **>260** after grinding Divine Intervention ([AMA: Step 2 Score 211 --> 262 real deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1dl9za6/ama_step_2_score_211_262_real_deal/) by[u/LipidLikeaBilayer](https://www.reddit.com/user/LipidLikeaBilayer/) in[Step2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/))
* Did research at my home program (paid), 100% in-person, worked directly with my PI
* Learned stats (SPSS or R), IRBs, writing — critical skills if you want to be productive
* Strong advice: **take Step 2 before starting** and **work directly with a surgeon**
* It’s a grind, but this year gave me real skills and helped reshape my application

  
I’m writing this because I was advised to take a research year to strengthen my application for orthopedic surgery, primarily due to average third-year clinical grades. I want to help remove the stigma of a research year (it's not the end of the world) and help future students be successful in the Match. I attend a top-40 NIH-funded medical school with a strong orthopedic department, but only average clerkship grades. I had decent ortho mentorship starting early in med school, but my PI already was already mentoring students/residents to their capacity, which limited my ability to get involved in meaningful projects. In hindsight, it was clear that if you’re not the go-to student for a surgeon, it’s hard to get on their radar.

Others I know took research years for various reasons—some didn’t have a home ortho program, others had low Step 2 scores or were looking for better mentorship or stronger letters. Personally, I don’t think a research year is necessary for everyone, but the stigma is definitely fading. That said, from what I’ve seen, those who take a research year to try to compensate for low Step 2 scores tend to struggle more in the match than those who combine strong scores *with* research. I acknowledge my grades weren’t stellar, but I’m all-in on ortho and decided this was the best way to invest in my application.

I didn’t commit to the research year until late into third year. My PI approached me, and after talking it through with mentors, classmates, and matched applicants, I decided to stay at my home institution—mainly because of my significant other (also in medicine). This allowed me to really focus in on Step 2 and I feel that it is a large reason for why I actually performed well on Step 2. Many of my colleagues relocated for research years and embedded themselves at new institutions where they plan to do sub-internships during fourth year. Everyone I know is working in person, which I believe is crucial if you are going to a different instutition. Some work for a group of surgeons, while others report to just one attending. If possible, I strongly recommend working directly with a single surgeon. Without face time, it’s very hard to build the kind of personal relationship that leads to meaningful letters and long-term mentorship.

I was fortunate to be in a paid position. That’s a big deal—especially in expensive cities—because many research positions are unpaid, which adds a significant financial burden if you don’t have outside support. If you're considering a year like this, plan ahead financially. Some of the hardest parts for people I know were not academic, but financial and logistical.

One of the most important decisions I made was taking Step 2 before starting my research year. I highly recommend this approach—even if it means starting research a few weeks late. A few of my peers delayed Step 2 until after their research year, and most underperformed or just did okay. Being away from clinical material and trying to study during a full-time research job is a recipe for burnout. **Your #1 priority during a research year should be research.** These jobs don’t pay enough to justify slacking, and your productivity - measured by manuscripts, presentations, and publications - is ultimately how programs will judge the success of your year.

My daily routine was focused entirely on research. I had the option to spend some days in clinic or the OR, but I opted to go all-in on research (albeit, I did spend a couple days in the OR near the end to brush up on my skills). During the day, I felt an obligation to maximize output since I was getting paid, and I knew that my publication record would be the only objective measure of the work I put in. I also made it a priority to go to all (appropriate) resident learning sessions to just get may face out there. I treated the year like a full-time job—often working late, checking email after hours and on weekends, and occasionally going to the office for a few hours on weekends. Though I tried to keep weekends light, the work definitely spilled over. I reported directly to my PI, but I was expected to work independently, manage my own projects, and be self-motivated.

Before the research year, I had around 2–4 publications either submitted or published and \~10 presentations or posters. At the end of my year, I’ll have over 30 publications submitted or published, with more than 10 as first author. That number may be higher than average—I had preexisting relationships with my team and some projects in progress—but the key point is that you can achieve a high level of output if you’re organized, proactive, and focused. Many people that I know were not for various reasons (Step2 studying, going to OR/clinic too much, golfing or rec activities took priority). In the beginning, for most people, it takes at least a few months to get traction. Databases need to be built, IRBs need approval, and it takes time to collect and clean data before you can even start writing.

The most important skill I gained was the ability to perform my own statistical analyses. **This is a non-negotiable if you want to maximize productivity**. It is worth noting, but this is coming from someone with a computer programming degree with 3+ years in industry prior to medical school. You don’t want to be stuck waiting for a statistician or another student to run numbers for you. Whether you learn SPSS, R, or another program, mastering statistics will make you incredibly valuable. You’ll get asked to help with other projects. You’ll be invited to collaborate with new attendings. If you can bring clean data, run the analysis, and present a draft manuscript, you become a research engine. That’s when things start to snowball.

I also became proficient with IRB submissions, retrospective study design, data management, and manuscript writing. Retrospective databases, in particular, were the secret weapon. With a solid database, you can ask a huge number of research questions and crank out projects efficiently. Prospective studies are great in theory but are slow, take time to enroll patients, and usually won’t produce results within a 12-month research year. Retrospective studies are your best chance to build a productive CV.

Reflecting on the year, I feel like I’ve learned how to go from idea to IRB to publication completely independently. Whether or not it helps me match remains to be seen, but the skills I’ve gained are invaluable. Coming from a blue-collar family and background with zero academic exposure or research experience before med school, this year changed the way I view academic medicine. I never thought I’d enjoy research, but this year helped me realize that I actually love it.

If you're considering a research year, my advice is this: make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons, take Step 2 beforehand, work directly with a surgeon in person, and learn how to manage data and run your own statistics. This isn’t an easy year—it’s a grind—but if you do it right, it can completely change the trajectory of your career. I’m happy to answer questions below.

  
ETA: the 30+ publications will come from multiple groups across multiple institutions that I have worked with and earned authorship by ICJME standards for authorship. Not all will be accepted at any given time, but rather constitute a distribution across many statuses: published, accepted pending publication, accepted pending revisions, and submitted in review. 

Furthermore, I would like to provide more context. I am a computer programmer with 3+ years in the biotech industry. This also had a lot to do with contributing to my success of my year. Financially, I had a lot saved up from my prior career. - the point of this write up was to highlight the importance of gaining research skills to be successful.

1ibp6x9,Can we talk about quiet quitting again?,"Hi,

I’m a middle-aged associate professor in the humanities at a private university that is thriving as far as these things go. I used to be quite active on this sub, and it helped me both through and past a long period of burnout in 2021–23. Due to some poor thinking and carelessness on the part of administrators, my salary declined last year because I didn’t get as much summer teaching. Downloading my W2 this past week and seeing the impact has kinda wrecked me. I can’t believe at my career stage I earned less in 2024 than in 2023.

My immediate reaction is “they pretend to pay me and I’ll pretend to work.” So I’d like to stop saying “yes” to service requests, pushing scholarship through conference presentations to publications, and freeze development on my pedagogy. The issue is that if I pull back from giving a full effort, none of the people who caused this—my unit-level head, staff and admin in the budget office, the senior leadership of the school, and the finance-bro board of trustees—will even notice. But people who have done me no wrong—my students, my colleagues, my department chair—would be impacted. They’d have to pick up my slack, rope others into doing what I currently volunteer to do, get less interaction with their instructor, etc.

I know this issue has been raised a million times, but please indulge me: what’s the appropriate response to falling salary when for personal and profession reasons switching institutions isn’t an option?

1f1ftiw,Advice and a word of caution to PhD Prospects ," Dearest ones, I know you hear this a lot, but I believe words of advice and caution should always be given when necessary.First of all congratulations for having the courage and drive to want to embark on ur phd, we are all proud of you. However, choosing the right SUPERVISOR is one of the most crucial decisions you'll make during your PhD journey. It's essential to conduct thorough research on potential supervisors beyond just their academic achievements or the number of publications they have. Look into their track record of successfully graduating students. Find out how long it typically takes for their students to complete their degrees and whether these students are mentally happy and emotionally ok after completing their PhD. It’s also invaluable to reach out to former students, especially those who are no longer affiliated with the supervisor. These individuals can provide honest, unfiltered insights into what working with that supervisor is really like. Don't shy away from asking the tough questions about their supervisory style, expectations, and the reality of working under their guidance.

⚠️ Caution ⚠️ 

Beware of the allure of a supervisor who appears overly supportive or charming during the beginning of communication process. Sometimes, supervisors might present themselves as the perfect match or as someone who cares deeply about your success. It's easy to be swayed when you're eager to secure a position or when you're impressed by their reputation, but remember that nothing is more important than your mental health and overall well-being. A supportive and understanding supervisor can make your PhD experience rewarding, while a mismatch can lead to unnecessary stress, depression,  burnout, and a challenging experience.

Your mental health and well-being are paramount, so choose wisely. No degree or academic achievement is worth compromising your peace of mind and happiness.You got this, we are all rooting for you.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1f1ftiw/advice_and_a_word_of_caution_to_phd_prospects/
1ludy7n,20/20 Reasons Every Medical Student should consider Ophthalmology,"**Intro:** I'm a current ophthalmology resident in the US and wanted to share some in**sight** (pun-intended) into why everyone should consider ophthalmology as a potential field.

**My backstory:** I too, like many others, thought that eyeballs were disgusting and that ophthalmology was one of the most boring fields in medicine. I mean, why would any sane person spend 4 years studying body medicine just to throw away all that knowledge to focus on diseases of the two balls of jelly in the sockets of my skull that a seasoned optometrist can handle right? I came into medical school knowing I wanted to be a cardiologist 100%, no doubt. In fact that's what I did my college research on.

At first, ophthalmology wasn’t even on the radar. In need of shadowing hours to apply to medical school, the only available opportunity came from a local comprehensive ophthalmologist. The experience, admittedly, didn’t make a strong first impression — it felt routine, even dull. But that exposure quietly planted a seed. Over time, it became clear that ophthalmology offered a rare combination: the ability to make direct, tangible impact, engage in precise hands-on procedures, and maintain a balanced lifestyle. Once in medical school, the appeal only deepened — and the path forward became undeniable.

**Why ophthalmology?**

**1. ¿Por qué no los dos? (Why not both?)**

How many of you heard the advice ""First decide between surgical or non-surgical"" when choosing a specialty. Well, if you truly hate surgery you can stop reading now because ophthalmology is a surgical field no matter how you see it (and while it's true that neuro-ophth or ophtho oncology may be less surgical, you still have to go through surgical training per the ACGME in residency).

What about people who want both medicine and surgery? Great news! In ophthalmology you can have both. Actually, you get 3 categories of care: Outpatient clinic, surgery in the OR, and procedures in-office. If you love variety or want variety in your schedule, ophthalmology may be a great fit for you. Imagine clocking into the same clinic 8 AM - 5 PM every single day for 30 years. Now imagine on Monday - Wednesday you see clinic patients and do some in-house procedures, Thursday you operate, and Friday you work a half day to see post-ops and go home by 1 PM with your entire weekend off? If the latter sounds like something you would like, it's possible in ophthalmology.

OBGYN, urology, and ENT also offer the same perks of being a hybrid specialty but at the cost of a longer residency, worse hours, and/or more emergencies.

**2. The need for eye care is increasing**

Every one reading this will develop cataracts eventually unless you die before they form. Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are no where near controlled in America, all of which are risk factors for devastating eye pathologies that require ophthalmic care and even surgery in some instances unless you want to become permanently blind. Every July 4th, some poor unfortunate soul gets shot in the eye with a firework and needs immediate attention.

America's population is aging. And don't even get me started on the large need of eye care and cataract surgery for countries outside of the U.S.A. Everybody eventually is going to need to see an ophthalmologist. The demand for trained eye specialists is not declining any time soon, especially given the fact that 99% of physicians don't know how to treat eye pathologies period.

**3. The art of the physical exam**

Ophthalmology is one of the few specialties where the physical exam matters before you even get imaging or diagnostic studies. It requires finesse, skill, and the ability to use both hands and your brain simultaneously.

You are analyzing parts of the eyes as thick as couple microns and sometimes evaluating the presence of red blood cells with your own eyes. You can even diagnose a patient without a proper history because you can often see the diagnosis yourself.  For those who appreciate technical skill, the tradition of the physical exam, and the ability to see literal blood vessels, nerves, and microtrauma with your own eyes, you will find ophthalmology to be a truly captivating field.

**4. You are a specialty consult service and can do many things in-house**

I personally see this as a pro because ophthalmology is rarely the primary team, if ever. You are consulted for your help and then you get to dip out of there. Long gone are those long-winded stories about how grandma baked brownies for her granddaughter's sweet sixteen after you asked the simple question of whether she still takes her Lisinopril.

Visits are often more straightforward, focused, and efficient than primary care clinic or internal medicine rounds. Ophthalmologists have access to their own procedure suites and imaging units (OCT, Ultrasounds, Laser rooms, injections). If your patient needs something, simply send them down the hall to get it ASAP. Compare that to some of your IM folks who have to place the order for an MRI, then things get lost in translation or the radiologist doesn't provide the impression in time, etc.

Which brings me to my next point

**5. You are the clinician, the surgeon, AND the radiologist for your patient all at once.**

Ophthalmologist not only treat diseases medically and procedurally and surgically, but they also diagnose and evaluate through imaging. From photos of the back of your eye, to cross-sections of the layers of your retina, to ultrasounds of your eyeballs, ophthalmologists can perform, read, **and** interpret their own imaging without the need for a radiologist.

**6. Lifestyle and Job Satisfaction**

It's no secret that ophthalmology is a ROAD specialty and grants a balance of lifestyle, salary, and job [satisfaction. ](https://www.aao.org/education/headline/high-career-satisfaction-rates-among-ophthalmologi)Ophthalmologists are routinely rated as one of the happiest physicians and would choose both medicine AND ophthalmology again if they went back in time. Rates of burnout are low. They spend one of the [least amount of time charting](https://www.beckersasc.com/uncategorized/the-specialties-spending-the-most-least-time-on-paperwork/), especially if they have a personal loyal scribe Jonathan.

If you like the idea of being able to manage diseases medically and surgically while still maintaining a good lifestyle, ophthalmology should be near or at the top of your potential specialties of interest.

Oh, did I mention ophthalmology residency is **4 years.** Technically 3 years because 1 year is IM. This is one of the best deals in medicine.

**7. Fellowship is OPTIONAL and there's something for everyone.**

Not only is residency only 4 years, but fellowship is TRULY OPTIONAL. Some of the highest earners and happiest doctors are comprehensive ophthalmologists who do cataract and refractive (LASIK/PRK/SMILE) surgery which doesn't require a fellowship.

If you do fancy a fellowship, there are a TON of options: Cornea/Refractive, Glaucoma, Medical and Surgical Retina, Oculoplastics, Neuro-ophthalmology, Pediatrics, and more niche fields such as Uveitis and Ocular Oncology.

Want a high stakes, fast-paced specialty within ophtho? Surgical retina is great

Enjoy more of the refractive, quality of life improvement side of ophtho? Refractive and cataract surgery is a great option

Like the more medical side of ophthalmology? Neuro-ophtho and/or Uveitis fits that bill

Realized you don't like the eyeballs that much but enjoy the structures around the eye? Oculoplastics has you covered.

**8. Quality of life improvement**

Going blind is one of the top fears in America.

This goes without saying but cataract surgery allows you to quite literally cure blindness in 15 minutes. LASIK can rid somebody of glasses or contacts for decades, allowing them to wake up with 20/20, play sports without corrective lenses, save money from buying contact lenses, and reduce the risk of contact lens induced infections (there are many articles that indicate that the rates of complications and infection from wearing contact lenses are higher than that of refractive laser surgery).

Some patients will go blind forever after a retinal detachment for instance. Only an ophthalmologist can go into the eyeball and re-attach your retina back in your eyeball and preserve your vision.

You think transplant surgery is only for transplant surgeons? Well good news, ophthalmologists can transplant corneas from one person to another.

Some babies are born with congenital defects and cataracts which can make them amblyopic for life. Imagine living your entire life seeing double? Great news, an ophthalmologist can fix that issue before it becomes a permanent issue.

From a newborn to a 100 year old patient, ophthalmologists can care for a wide range of patients and provide immense quality of life improvements.

**9. The technology is rapidly evolving**

If you like technology and innovation, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for it. Ophthalmology is a field rooted in technology, lenses, physics, optics, lasers, imaging modalities, robotics, microsurgical tools, etc. People are incorporating AI to help diagnose ophthalmic disease and screen for glaucoma. Lens technology is improving every year so that patients who undergo cataract surgery can become less dependent on glasses with reduced side effects from the surgery. The potential is endless and ophthalmology attracts many people who have backgrounds in CS, engineering, and even architecture.

**10. One of the best fields for global outreach**

If you enjoy helping those in need outside of the USA or perhaps have a religious background and want to use your skills to help the less fortunate outside the US borders, ophthalmology is one of the best fields for that. The prevalence of infections and need for routine cataract surgery is immense across the globe and ophthalmology provides opportunities to do high-impact surgeries and medical treatments for those who need eye care.  Ophthalmology even has a literal [flying eye hospital](https://www.orbis.org/en/what-we-do/flying-eye-hospital) inside of a plane.

**Common Misconceptions and Responses:**

**1. ""I don't want to sit there going ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" ""1 or 2?"" all day long.**

Most ophthalmologists do not refract their own patients like this routinely and even if they did, it does not take up majority of their day. Our main job is not to prescribe glasses. It's to diagnose and manage eye disease. If you think this is what ophthalmologists do all day, this is a severe miscategorization

**2. ""What a waste of medical school to just focus on eyeballs"".**

Ophthalmology is deeply interdisciplinary, and many cases require knowledge across **general medicine, neurology, rheumatology, dermatology, infectious disease, and more.**

For instance, **diabetic retinopathy r**equires understanding systemic diabetes control and knowing how to educate patients on the importance of A1c control in relation to their eye health.

**Thyroid Eye Disease r**equires collaboration with endocrinology for managing thyroid dysfunction and orbital disease.

**CN III, IV, VI palsies r**equire full **neuro exams, stroke risk evaluation**, and sometimes urgent **neuroimaging.**

**Uveitis** can be caused by systemic diseases like **sarcoidosis, HLA-B27 diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis), Behçet's, lupus** and requires knowing relevant labs i.e ANA, RF, HLA-B27, ACE, etc.)

**Herpes Zoster** can affect not just your skin (derm) but also your eyes.

**CMV retinitis** is common in patients with low CD4 counts (AIDS) and requires knowing how to collaborate with doctors who provide antiretroviral therapies.

**Artery occlusions of the eye** require stroke workup, carotid US, possible echocardiograms, understanding of hyper-coagulability such as in the case of antiphospholipid syndrome, malignancy, etc.

A good ophthalmologist must have the underlying fundamentals of medicine and multiple specialties to evaluate systemic causes of ocular disease and more effectively coordinate and understand the plans of other physicians that might be taking care of the same patient.

**3. Surgery on eyeballs sounds disgusting**

While I can't convince everybody that ocular surgery isn't as bad as it looks (because even I'll admit some eye disease and surgeries look really gnarly), please note that ophthalmic surgery is highly controlled, precise, and requires extreme finesse and steady hands. Ophthalmologists are working inside a tiny capsule in your eyeball to remove a cataract or sometimes peeling off literal layers of your retina. It takes hours of practice and technique to master ophthalmic surgery and is done in a clean, precise manner with anesthesia. No we don't get a knife and slice down the cornea and rip open your eye. No we don't scoop out people's eyeballs with a ice cream scooper in clinic. No we don't inject needles through your pupil.

**4. Optometry scope creep**

I'll just say that majority of optometrists do not want to do surgery and even if they did, they do not have the medical expertise to both perform surgery or to manage any of the complications from surgery and thus should not even be allowed to cut the eyeball period. Optometrists and ophthalmologists have a pretty good relationship and often work TOGETHER to refer and manage patients as a team. And NPs and PAs typically don't fight for any ophthalmology rights, at least none to my knowledge.

At the end of the day, people are going to flock to a trained ophthalmologist when it comes down to severe eye disease, surgical referrals, and trauma. So no, that optometrist at your local optical shop is not going to replace us in 10 years.

**Final words for upcoming and current med students:** Just take a chance and learn more about ophthalmology or shadow. Consider things you want in a specialty and whether it caters to your strengths and life values/goals.

Ophthalmology is competitive. It's been hovering around a 65-69% ish match rate with no signs of it becoming less competitive. However, it's competitive for a reason clearly. Study hard, shadow, be open to any learning opportunity. Even if you don't end up deciding on ophthalmology, I hope that the main takeaway here is to not knock it til you try it.

1e7k225,What's up with the hate towards Internal Medicine as a career?,"I came into IM hearing things about how rounding takes forever, social and dispo work, burnout, low salary. I spent a couple weeks with a hospitalist at a large community hospital and my experience with these concerns were:

1. Rounding takes forever: I feel like students only see academic IM and \*some\* attendings that take forever to round and think that's all IM doctors do but the doctor I was with rounded very quickly. He said that the myth of long rounds and lectures on sodium are mainly memes perpetuated by students and that as an attending, you set the pace. 

2. Social and dispo work: I get that it can be annoying coordinating this but 99% of the dispo work is done by the social work and dispo team. If a patient is denied at a SNF, the social work team messages us saying they'll look into alternatives and get back to us. Never once during my academic or community IM experiences did I see an attending trying to figure out how to get a patient home. 

3. Burnout: This is highly variable and a 7 on 7 off schedule can be brutal but my attending would often leave around 4 PM? 7 AM - 4 PM and then take phone calls. Weekends were even shorter. And this is also including a hefty lunch break where we got to kick our feet up, type notes, chat, etc. while eating in the workroom.

4. Low salary: again this is variable and I didnt' ask my attending about his salary but job offers online list positions ranging from $200,000-$300,000/yr which, personally, is good money. It's not ortho money or plastics money but still a lot. 

I feel like a lot of students also shit on surgery for being long days, holding retractors, getting shit on by surgeons yet so many students want to go into surgery.

1iirmha,PhD quitting,"I’ve noticed a lot of posts here lately from PhD students seriously considering quitting their programs. I completely understand that life can hit really hard, and burnout is real—but as someone who dreams of starting a PhD, it’s left me feeling really conflicted. This has been a lifelong dream for me.

To add to the confusion, I’m currently in a tough spot emotionally. I applied to five PhD programs this cycle and just got rejected from two. Still waiting on the remaining three, but the anxiety (and creeping self-doubt) is hitting hard. Part of me wonders: *If so many people want to leave, why does it feel impossible to even get in?*  

Has anyone else struggled with this disconnect between the ""dream"" and the reality?

****Update 
Thank you so much for all the support and guidance you’ve provided. Many of the comments were genuinely helpful, and I truly appreciate them. People often ask me, “Why is a PhD your dream?” As a current master’s student and teaching assistant, pursuing a PhD is the natural next step in my academic journey. Beyond this, my passion lies in research—particularly in my field of study—which drives my commitment to continue growing as a scholar.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1iirmha/phd_quitting/

1bidbu8,"People who love inpatient IM versus people who hate IM, can I know your reasons why?","I think I'm crazy but I'm actually considering IM now with the option to maybe fellowship. The more I learn, the better I get at it, and the more interesting it is. But I've also gotten A LOT of pushback with people telling me to avoid IM and that it's not as great as it sees.

I'm curious what opinions you have for those who either love it or hate it?

&#x200B;

if you care about my opinion here's my take:

My pros for inpatient IM:

1. You set the pace on rounds. It feels liberating whereas clinic is constantly go-go-go and perpetually behind.
2. You can spend more time on sicker patients and less on stable patients whereas in clinic, you are bound by the schedule for that day
3. You have time to think and sit and grab a coffee before seeing patients or in between patients. You can discuss with colleagues and nurses. It just feels chill.
4. If you're on shift work, you're completely off when you're off. No pagers, no inboxes and emails that pile up.
5. Patient's aren't usually acutely ill to the point of death like in the ICU (unless ofc you go into ICU medicine or PCCM)
6. The stereotype that IM doctors jerk each off about sodium and potassium is not that true in my personal experience and even if it was, it doesn't mean you have to become an attending who does that.

My cons:

1. Dumping service from other teams
2. Have to consult to proceed in patient care many times
3. Lower pay, high burnout
4. Inefficiencies in the hospital i.e you place orders but nurse didn't apply it. You order labs but nobody draws them.
5. Some consult teams can be assholes

1mq0jy3,Am I overreacting or is my workload actually too much?,"Hello,

I’m a 3rd-year PhD student in psychology, and this fall will be my first time teaching as the sole instructor for a class. I’ll have 2 sections, 2 hours each per week, with a total of about 50 students. I’m responsible for all the lectures, grading, and communication.

At the same time, I’ll be taking two courses as a student myself (one in statistics and one in my area). I’m also actively collecting data for my research, working on a manuscript, and planning to submit an abstract for a conference.

Here’s the thing: I’m already feeling stressed before the semester even starts. As an international student, I don’t have much of a local social support network, and teaching in English for the first time adds extra anxiety. I want to do a good job, but I’m worried about burning out.

The psych course I’m taking as a student has kind of heavy workload (weekly readings, discussions, final paper). It’s actually the last course I need to fulfill my requirements, but I could technically take it in a future semester, there’s no urgent reason I must take it now.

Part of me wants to drop it so I can fully focus on teaching my class well (since it’s my first time), doing well in the stats course, working on my paper and data collection.

I want to enjoy the PhD process, not just “survive” the semester doing the bare minimum. But I’m second-guessing myself - am I being lazy or overreacting? Or is it reasonable to drop a course in order to avoid burnout and protect my mental health?

I plan to talk to my advisor, but I’d like to hear from others first. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?

I want to build a daily habit: **1 hour every day reading math research papers** (surveys, short notes, full papers) for the next 4 years. I don’t want strict deadlines or throughput targets (e.g., “finish 1 paper in X days”). My plan is simply: sit with a paper for one hour each day, try to understand as much as possible, take notes, and only set stricter goals once I’m more competent.

A few things I’m curious about::

* What will I actually be able to do after 4 years of this?
* Is 1 hour/day sustainable long-term or should I change the rhythm?
* Should I start with surveys/short papers or dive into full research articles immediately?
* Focus broadly across fields or pick one area by year 2–3?
* Realistic checkpoints at 6 months / 1 year / 2 years / 4 years?
* When could I reasonably expect to contribute to research (coauthor, reproduce+improve results, write an expository note)?
* Best way to approach professors or grad students for mentorship?
* Common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid burnout or getting stuck?
* Any tools/workflows that made a big difference for you?

1j11j2w,My $24k Scholarship Might Have Ruined My Life,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 19-year-old college sophomore currently majoring in Chemical Engineering, and I'm really at a crossroads right now. I'm making this post after failing my physics midterm (still have C in the overall course), so I might not be thinking straight but I'm on the verge of dropping out. This semester has been a nightmare. Sorry for the length.

A little backstory, I got an almost full ride (full tuition for 4yrs, a year of free housing, and an additional $500 a semester) along with an outside scholarship that gives $3000 a semester as long as I stick with engineering. However, a dangerous roommate situation severely impacted my GPA and academic performance, nearly causing me to lose these. I was put on probation last semester, I got a 3.2 GPA after being on probation (and moving to a studio), but this semester my grades have tanked to around 1.25 (A in one class, F in 2 others). I've been struggling with everything from a daily 8AM in-person lecture (after biking 7-15 minutes in cold, even rainy/snowy weather), extreme burnout, undiagnosed mental health issue(s) that I've struggled with since middle school that have only gotten worse in college, I can't speak to people normally, insomnia (but for some reason I fall asleep if I attempt to seriously study), poor financial management (last semester I only ate one meal a day but now I have to eat like 2-3 or else I feel hungry but rent is almost $2000/month and I don't have a job or car).

Since I've already been on probation I doubt they'll give me another chance if this semester tanks. I'm starting to seriously question whether I should stick with engineering or switch majors, or even consider leaving college altogether. I'm grateful for the 24k engr scholarship, but I despise it at the same time. I passed Calc and Chemistry, and I've never struggled in a Biology class, so I should've just majored in that. I was top of my class when I did a CNA program at a tech college during high school. The risk outweighed the reward and now my GPA's about to be in hell, and I won't even be able to get federal aid. I hate ChemE major so much.

The work is hard and requires a level of thinking and processing time that just isn't suited for me. It's not that I don't get the concepts but it takes me too long to learn them, so I always end up behind. Then I feel stupid after the tests have passed because of how I missed questions that I can now easily comprehend. I hate the way my professors look at me when I ask a question, like they can't understand the words that are coming out of my mouth that sounded so clear in my brain. I hate being ignored by professors when I reach out to them in emails. I hate how these motherfuckers act so superior to people just because they're a professor.

I’ve been looking into certificate programs (like dental lab tech or pharmacy tech) because I want a job with a stable, repetitive routine where I don’t have to deal with the chaos of customer service or constantly shifting responsibilities. Ideally, I’d love a role where I can work semi-independently and eventually afford my own small place (like a one bedroom/studio) in a safe neighborhood, with enough to cover healthy food (I’m tired of having to eat junk cause it’s more affordable). I don’t want a 6 figure income or to travel constantly or have a whole bunch of clothes and tech, etc. I just want the basics and to be safe and away from my family.

I’m also considering trying to land an online job, even though my work history is limited to a few customer service positions (the longest being 6 months). I’m not sure if companies would consider me seriously given my age and the fact I’ve mostly done customer service. If anyone has experience or advice on how to present myself for online roles—or what sites are best for finding such jobs—I’d really appreciate your input.

TL;DR: Should I try to switch majors and keep pushing through college, or is it better to consider alternative career paths like a certificate program or online work, even if it means facing some judgment from others? How can I best set myself up for stability and independence given where I am right now?

1iwwxm7,Make Sure You Are Going to School for the Right Reasons,"I just want to start off by saying, I am very grateful that I have had the opportunity to work at a master’s degree and am proud to be graduating in the spring with it. I also recognize that I am very lucky in the fact that I was able to get it majorly funded through becoming a TA and recognize that I am very lucky to have gotten the ability to not only go to grad school but go for what will be a little under $3000 for the entirety of my master’s program, especially when looking at how things are going with the current administration and so much being up in the air when it comes to funding and such here in the United States.

With all that being said, I just want to caution you if you are thinking about attending and why you want to attend. I will fully admit, I do not think I did start my MA for the correct reasons. I will fully admit, I started because I felt it could allow for me to get paid more adequately in the job market, and I was at a job that I was not particularly passionate about. And now I feel like I am the same place as I was two years ago. I often regret my choice to go to school, but I am in no way not going to complete it, I am here for essentially three more months, it would be stupid not to. I joke about how I will never actually use my master’s (which I know rationally isn’t true). I am working on not being upset with my past self and moving forward, and ultimately, while I may not think I have gone for the correct reasons, I am proud of the fact that I currently have a 4.0 GPA in a program and field that I personally hate, again, not the program or field’s fault, just not something I particularly care about in the slightest. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s just self frustration because I am going in a different direction in my life. I am unsure.

What I will say, really do yourself a favor and look into why you want to go to grad school. Do you feel like you are unsure where you are going in life? Maybe avoid going until you are confident in what you are thinking about in that regard. It is a commitment, and I really only recommend going if this is something you absolutely love and are passionate about. Grad school can be an extremely rewarding experience and one that can really advance you in life- but only if it is something you really want to pursue. And also look into if you really want to engage in academia. It is definitely different than undergrad, there is tons of research involved, much more reading, and can be extremely time consuming. 

This isn’t meant to ward anyone away from joining a grad program! I have met some wonderful friends in my program who absolutely love everything we do within the program. Even though I have some regrets, I have ultimately leaned more on the side that I am glad I went. I just wanted to give my experience and thoughts, and sort of maybe lay everything out there. Good luck to everyone!

1.) First PhD advisor dropped me due to a dispute over how I managed the lab. She advised me from 2020 (my first year)-2022.

2.) Program chair thankfully takes me as an advisee. At this point though, my autistic burnout and PTSD (yes, it's clinically diagnosed) were so bad that I could only focus on doing one research project at a time (my first PhD advisor made me only work on one project at a time) and still am only working on only my dissertation. I put in 10-20 hours per week's worth of work this academic year.

3.) My stipend got cut in half my 3rd year due to university budget issues. Same tuition waiver was intact thankfully, so I got the rest of my program paid off at that point.

4.) I got a visiting instructor gig at a nearby SLAC my 4th year and bombed it horribly (this is not hyperbole either, I got 1-2s out of 5 across the board on all categories). Thankfully, it fulfilled service credit for me to keep some fellowship money.

Notably, I never collaborated throughout my PhD and was basically isolated from every other department and professor in my case.

123ppzd,The constant cringefest that is grad school,"In undergrad, I was on top of my shit. Gears changing constantly. Though the classes were easier, there were more of them and the subjects were more varied. Work/internship/research. Student organizations. Events and planning. Prep for professional life and grad school. Social life. So many things, and I rarely if ever dropped the ball. I felt like a machine. Fulfilling and purposeful work. We were all ready to change the world.

In grad school, dropping the ball has become business as usual. Throughout my department, people drop commitments without announcement, show up late to meetings, miss deadlines, and send emails after the fact - sometimes apologetic and others accusatory. Presentations and papers are thrown together last minute, and lectures are permeated with the constant undertone, ""There are much better uses of my time than this,"" from both instructors and students. Resources to prepare for industry or education (anything outside of research, really) are scant - treated as obligatory by the department - and those who seek them out are viewed as admitting burnout or a lack of commitment or skill. Research is carried out with petty comments and measuring contests. People trade shady favors, becoming authors of papers to which they didn't contribute and exchanging techniques to fudge numbers and buy time. Those who are seated in tenured research positions seem constantly frazzled. If you ever ask them how to develop yourself, where to find meaning, how to generate questions and goals, you get a weak laugh and some half-hearted talk for 5min. Watching them work has been like watching someone stuck in a bad marriage. The encouragements that have come my way feel like the lies people tell themselves while losing religion.

I've never caved to academic dishonesty, but I can't deny that the lack of professionalism has rubbed off on me. It's hard for anyone to generate sincerity and drive in a system this demoralizing.

1bnsjwx,I refuse to break my boundaries. Will this not go over well for doing a PhD?,"Hey everyone,

Basically what the title says.

For context, I’m starting a PhD program this fall (biomedical sciences in the US) and I have been reading all the posts talking about burnout, working weekends, overextending yourself, advisor’s unrealistic expectations, etc. I’ve worked in industry for 3 years and I am so grateful for it. It really taught me how to set boundaries around work-life balance and stick to them after a loooooong time of me overworking myself to make a good impression as a researcher. 

Of course, there have still been many times I’ve worked late or on the weekends so it’s not like I refuse to ever work more hours/on weekends but you get the idea, only when it’s absolutely necessary. I’ve just learned to not back down from advocating for myself so I’m not one to shy away from having difficult conversations with higher ups. 

Someone tell me if I’m delusional but I plan to tackle my PhD lab rotations and future research on a 9-5 schedule within reason as I do now (not classwork, just lab stuff). I’m not about to completely break my boundaries to appease potentially unrealistic work expectations for these 5 years.

I work efficiently during my work hours but, from experience, staying late just leads me to make mistakes (I have ADHD so when the meds wear off concentration is definitely not at 100%).

1f5ll4z,This is what you are fighting for,"Working as a programmer these days is so stressful and stubborn, especially on low positions, and you guys can't even get breadcrumbs, which are interviews for internships. The market is oversaturated with candidates, and companies are expecting more and more for less pay. It feels like no matter how hard you work or how much you learn, you're just another cog in the machine, easily replaceable and undervalued.

And let's not even talk about the constant pressure to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. It's like you're on a never-ending treadmill, running to keep up, but never really getting anywhere. The burnout rate is through the roof, and it's no wonder so many talented developers are leaving the field altogether.

It's frustrating to see the industry becoming more about squeezing every ounce of productivity out of developers rather than fostering innovation, creativity, and a healthy work-life balance. The passion that once drove many of us into this career is being drained by a system that values profits over people.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1f5ll4z/this_is_what_you_are_fighting_for/
1jdjmtb,Should I continue my PhD?,"I’m towards the end of my third year of my PhD and I’ve gotten behind in my research. I struggle with ADHD so my time management has been pretty bad. I’m a black female btw. 
It Basically looks like I don’t get much done. I do feel like a disappointment a lot of the time because I could’ve gotten so much done these past couple years.
I have a couple papers in progress, but it’s just been lagging with the data on my part. I’m really trying to get my shit together, but I feel like I keep disappointing my advisor and my collaborators. 
I just feel really embarrassed with the lack of work that I have done and I’m trying to get it together. 

What do you think?

Update***
So my gender and skin color come into play for my specific experience because I’ve never met anyone that looks like me that’s also struggling with ADHD. So I just felt alone and not seen. I’m also one out of two black women in my whole department on the grad school level. So I have a lot of imposter syndrome, not thinking I’m good enough, etc. I’ve had a lot of trouble managing my adhd and getting work done especially with burnout coming into play. And particularly as a black women it looks like a bad look for me to look unproductive because I could easily be seen as a stereotype. I’ve tried with a couple therapists in the past to help me try and get more productive with the adhd but they weren’t helpful. 
That’s why I wanted to hear advice from other people so I can get a better idea of how to get through it.
But I also understand too other nonblack people might also deal with adhd issues as well in this journey.

mcdenj,Today I Withdrew From Medical School,"I'd be lying if I said I was one of students who said they wanted to be a physician from a young age. Something about being shuttled from specialist to specialist at a young age to figure out what causing my seizure disorder without a permanent fix had me questioning the efficacy of modern medicine. It wasn't really until I had a focal resection to eliminate uncontrolled seizures that I really began to believe in the life changing effects of medicine. Even then medical school still seemed like a distant dream. In uni, I found myself exhausted and over-caffeinated as I tried to balance volunteering in a lab, extracurricular, and a full class load. My parents told me it wasn't possible, though their tune changed once I scored well on the MCAT. From their it continued to be a struggle. First cycle, 3 interviews yielding 3 waitlists despite letter of intents. I worked endlessly to chase pubs, bring up my sGPA, and less then optimal clinical jobs. Second cycle, 4 interviews, 4 wait lists. A month before matriculation, a sudden admissions email. A acceptance? Granted it was my last choice but a US MD school nonetheless. A sense of relief knowing that the hardest part was over. Or so they say. 

&#x200B;

First year was probably easier then the worst of undergrad. It definitely took some time to figure out how to approach in-house tests, but such is life. Seasonal depression, burnout struck, failed a block. Remediation began, still burned out, failed again. Repeating a year went alright after overcoming my personal stigma against SSRIs and establishing new friendships/support. Had to remediate a few more themes, but more easily got into second year. Second year was a train wreck. A string of low passes despite adjusting study methods/resources, medication adjustments, and self care. Eventually managed to get a neuropsych eval for memory. I've never seen a provider so apologetic when delivering results. Memory, problem solving, and attention deficit. Permanent from surgery, and non-curable of course. Apparently she's seen people succeed with one but definitely not all three. Well they do say people only fail out from medschool for not wanting that MD degree bad enough, right? 

&#x200B;

A true fail. More medication adjustments and a stimulant to compensate. As despair sets in, a string of passes even in my worse blocks. Confidence starts to build. Right as my appeal passes, another marginal pass violating the terms of the appeals 2 blocks before dedicated. I'm defeated. Medical school specific learning specialists, psych, neuro, neuropsych, cognitive rehab, therapy, advising. I'm out of resources and out of appeals/year repeats to continue. I so desperately want to stay, yet even when I try my best I can't succeed. Yet in the back of my mind I wonder if I should have pushed harder I wonder if I could have pushed harder, and sacrificed my mental health. After all online we only read about those who overcome there struggles or chose to withdraw due to change of heart instead of personal ability. 

&#x200B;

I'm not quite sure about where I want to go from here. Being a hyper-focused bio grad doesn't really help with job prospects and my only real working experience is in nursing. I'm extremely fortunate to not have any student loans, which helps quite a bit. I don't quite know how to end this so I'll leave you all with something a ENT mentor once told me: ""Looking after a our mental health as a student and doctors of any age or status is the top priority.""

1n63mnp,[BREAKING NEWS] Admin Solves Burnout,"**Abstract:**  
Admin has finally cracked the code: the cure for clerkship fatigue is a *mandatory 3-hour wellness lecture* and a reflective essay. Mid-rotation. In this non-consensual trial, preliminary data suggests a statistically significant increase in exhaustion, antidepressant use, and caffeine dependency. 

**Introduction:** Burnout has plagued medical students for decades, often attributed to long hours, lack of autonomy, and crushing debt. While prior interventions have focused on improving sleep, mentorship, and workload reduction, these approaches require systemic change and thus were deemed “infeasible”. Instead, we hypothesized that a single PowerPoint-based intervention would not only solve burnout, but also generate new metrics to justify additional tuition fees.

**Methods:**  
Third-year medical students were forcibly extracted from wards, studying, and ""resident-only"" free lunches. They were then exposed to:

* **3 continuous hours** of lecture, tailored to be perfectly irrelevant to reality.
* **1 reflective essay** assignment with a minimum of 500 words requiring introspection on “how can you identify burnout and what can *you* do to fix it?”

**Results**:

**Table 1. Post-Intervention Symptoms**

|Symptom|Pre (%)|Post (%)|p-value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Exhaustion|89|92|<0.001|
|Caffeine Consumption|70|96|<0.001|
|Antidepressant Use|32|57|<0.001|
|Gratitude|12|0|NS|

*Figure 1 (not shown): Graph of admin self-satisfaction, which spiked to 100% after rollout.*

**Discussion**:

This intervention conclusively demonstrates that **the most effective way to address overwork is by adding more mandatory work.** Students initially suggested alternatives such as “accessible call rooms for 24 hour shifts”, ""fixing the only coffee maker students are allowed to use"", or “protected time off,” but these were rejected for being logistically inconvenient and not in line with the budget funded by *your* tuition. Future directions include a **mandatory wellness quiz** with a greater than 80% required  or students face a remediation course and a **reflection survey** about your reflection essay.

**Conclusion:**  
Burnout officially cured. Please submit your essays by Friday at 5 PM EST (yes, we know our school is in PST) or you’ll fail professionalism.

**TL;DR:** Admin decided the solution to burnout was… *more things to do.* Inspired by a true story. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1n63mnp/breaking_news_admin_solves_burnout/
1bifw2i,Partner of a PhD student here - how do/did you maintain work-life balance during your PhD?,"Edit: thank you all for your thoughtful comments & insights, they’ve been valuable in helping me understand work-life balance during a PhD better. I didn’t expect so many people to share so much with me. I’ll summarise the points made in a separate comment later on ☺️

I (24F) am working a 8-6 corporate job, while my partner (27M) is a computer science PhD student. His advisor is quite harsh towards him - he reminds me of an emotionally unstable parent - and this treatment has worsened as my partner’s qualifying exam deadline gets closer. My partner barely sleeps from the long working hours and stress, and doesn’t eat properly or exercise anymore. I’m so worried. 

I’ve heard that a PhD is incredibly stressful and makes work-life balance incredibly difficult, but I didn’t imagine it would be this disruptive. I try to support my partner by creating pockets of comfort & time away from work:

- having dinner together every day, whether it be him coming home for a few hours to cook/eat together or me visiting his lab to have take-out together
- encouraging him to sleep normal hours when possible, i.e., no urgent deadlines
- going out together on the weekends, usually grocery shopping or the gym
- listening to him and doing my best to understand his work & stressors. 

Is work-life balance possible, or even important, during your PhD? And if so, what are some things that you or your partner/family/friend did that helped? I want my partner to do his best in his PhD and feel proud of his work, but not at the expense of burnout or depression/anxiety.

1brbueu,Which medical specialty deals with the least amount of bullsh*t?,"Examples of said bullsh\*t include but aren't limited to:

* Administrative duties and tasks
* Charting and documenting
* Fighting with insurance/prior auths
* Phone updates, emails, inboxes filled to the brim
* Unnecessary consults (either bad consults or consults in the middle of the night)
* Frequent emergencies that require you to essentially live with a pager up your asshole
* Midlevel encroachment 
* Turf wars with other medical specialties
* Reduced reimbursements
* Being a dumping ground
* Unnecessary long-drawn small talk or conversations 
* Angriest or most ungrateful/least adherent patient populations
* Having to deal with asshole personalities in the hospital
* Having to deal with administrators breathing down your neck
* Dealing with disposition and finding the perfect SNF for Mr. Jones

EVERY specialty will deal with a combination of a lot of these, but I'm curious as to know which encompasses the least amount of them.

1gqrkcq,Are PhD years 4 and forward depressing for everyone?,"I'm at the beginning of my 4th year in bioengineering. and long story short: I'm just tired. I'm tired of school shit. of academia in general. 

School was a place I loved, and I started a PhD to finally become a PI, do my own research, and be surrounded by a young, curious generation. But doing a PhD and seeing this system inside out has destroyed all my dreams for the future. I no longer want to step into school, let alone become a PI.

But you know, in general, I'm tired of how the world works. Everyone is pretending to want to solve the problems, while they don't. Some basic things are still unknown and no one cares about that. They try to hide their protocols and boast about their results. The least and last thing they think about is a motive to solve an issue. 

So I don't know what I want to be in the future. I'm lost. I was just talking to my PI, and she was telling me it's normal to experience more burnout and mental exhaustion in 4th and 5th year and she has gone through it too. She is super nice by the way and is very supportive. 

  
so I'm just here to ask people who are either already in these years, or have passed this time, is it so? does everyone feel so tired in 4th year? and if you still are in the academy, what made you decide so, despite these issues? also, is the industry any better?

1htowf4,The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival),"Hi everyone. I am in the final year of a part-time PhD. I have been struggling with procrastination and lack of motivation for a very long time. Things are bleak for me - but I do want to complete. And I continue to explore ways to do so.

Today it hit me that what would be really useful was some kind of guide. Some kind of roadmap or pattern for a PhD. No-one has talked to me about this and I have not seen such a thing elsewhere \[they may exist, I just haven't seen them\].

So I created this ""8 Stages of PhD"" as a kind of map to help myself. But after I finished it I thought it might help others. So I'm posting it here.

**It is quite subjective** and very relevant to my own experience. But I'm sure others will relate to it too.

Transparency: This was a 'collaboration' with Google Gemini and ChatGPT. They wrote a lot of it \[but I write my own material when it comes to other stuff!\]. This was for my personal guidance, but after I had it I thought I'd share it anyway. Hopefully it helps a few others.

\----

**The 8 Stages of PhD: The Real Journey (With Insights for Survival)**

**1. Euphoric Anticipation:**

* You’re just starting out. You're bursting with ideas and ambition. The world is your oyster, and you’ve got the perfect thesis in mind. Motivation is *overflowing*.
* ""I’m going to revolutionise this field!"" you declare, ready to change everything. Insight: You might change your mind a hundred times, but that’s okay.

**2. Methodical Mania:**

* You dive headlong into research. The literature review becomes your universe, an endless rabbit hole of papers you *must* read.
* Your excitement is laced with creeping anxiety: “How do I organise this chaos into something coherent?” Insight: eventually it *will* happen. You'll get there.

**3. Impostor Syndrome Strikes:**

* The doubts creep in. ""What if I’m not smart enough for this?"" ""Is my research even *worthwhile*?""
* Insight: it’s easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to everyone else. But remember: they’re just as lost as you feel. You’re *not* an impostor—you're just in a deeply uncomfortable stage of PhD growth.

**4. The Data Desert:**

* The moment of despair: you hit a wall. The data either isn’t coming through or doesn’t make any sense. What you thought was a breakthrough is now just a puddle of confusion. Everything seems a mess and you have no idea how to organise it.
* Motivation has taken a permanent vacation, and you find yourself deep in the desert, parched for an oasis of progress. You wonder if you'll ever escape this desert. Insight: You will.

**5. The Burnout Abyss:**

* Here it is. You’re stuck. Every time you sit at your computer, the cursor mocks you. Ideas? Gone. Will to work? Non-existent.
* Procrastination feels like a full-time job. The idea of working on your PhD seems like a Herculean task. You start thinking, ""Maybe I should just take up a new career, like... dog walker?"". You watch ridiculous YouTube videos. You go on social media. You “take a break” after doing nothing for two hours. Rinse and repeat for days, weeks… or months.
* You stare at your digital folder with dread, feeling like even skimming an abstract is a monumental task. Reading feels pointless, overwhelming, and painfully dull.
* You fantasise about quitting and blame everything and everyone for your inability to work. ""It’s their fault!"" you cry. You consider therapy. Maybe you even do it.
* **Breakthrough Realisation:** Stop chasing motivation. It’s not coming. Start chasing *action*. It’s up to you to discover the way forward. There is a way through the woods, you just have to find it.
* Insight: If you're running low on mental reserves, you need to *lower the stakes*. Instead of e.g. aiming to read an entire paper, just read a paragraph. Instead of focusing on mastery, focus on *progress*.

**6. The Vomit Draft (optional bridge):**

* You stop waiting for perfection and start spilling every half-formed thought onto the page. It’s messy. It’s chaotic. But it’s progress.
* The key here: **lower the bar.** Forget brilliance—just focus on getting something down.
* It’s raw and unrefined, but hey, at least it exists. And from here, you can *polish*.
* Insight: These drafts are not just a stage—they’re a *strategy*. Embrace the chaos. Write poorly. Write messily. Write *anything*. The magic happens in the edit, not the first draft. Vomit drafting gets you from “nothing exists” to “something I can work with.” It’s your bridge from stuck to progress. As Jodi Picoult said, “I can always edit a bad page, I can’t edit a blank page.”

**7. The ""Just Finish It"" Frenzy:**

* Panic sets in. The deadline is looming, and suddenly, you realise this is *real*. You start running out of time, and the pressure hits you like a freight train.
* You enter a state of hyperfocus. Adrenaline is your new best friend, and caffeine is your only sustenance. The “Just Finish It” mentality kicks in.
* Insight: It’s not about *perfect*—it’s about *done*. Finish the damn thing.

**8. The Sweet Release (and Mild PTSD):**

* You defend your thesis. You survive. You succeed. Relief washes over you, but so does disbelief: ""Did I actually do that?!""
* The memories of the burnout and vomit drafts haunt you, but the joy of completion outweighs it all. You’ve earned this.

**The Takeaway**  
Every PhD journey is unique, but the struggles are universal. Whether you breeze through or rely on survival tactics, the key is persistence. Progress isn’t always pretty, but it’s progress nonetheless. You don’t have to be perfect—you just have to keep going. Good luck. You *can* do this.

Afterthought: It's possible to create a visual map from this. It could be something like:

1. The Golden Hills; 2. The Cornfield \[aka The Maize\]; 3. The Valley; 4. The Plateau; 5. The Chasm; 6. The Storm Cliffs; 7. The Racetrack; 8. The Mountaintop. This gives it more of a location-based epic computer game feel, but one which you'll eventually win.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1htowf4/the_8_stages_of_phd_the_real_journey_with/
1lis21z,PhD Burnout from Racial Bullying,"Does anyone have any advice on how to handle burnout/depression during the graduate program after facing prolonged racial bullying? I desperately need to meet deadlines but am having a hard time focusing on my work.

For some context, I am a third year PhD student and am currently working on my research proposal. Due to factors outside of my control, I ended up having to step up as president of a cultural organization a couple of years ago as no other undergrad was in the position to take on leadership. A larger geopolitical event more than doubled my responsibilities as president even though I tried my best to keep my organization out of the limelight. It was terrible trying to balance all of my professional responsibilities and medical issues with these, but was able to survive the first year.

Starting the second year, a more senior PhD student in a different program on campus began bullying me and some of my friends and enabled outside actors to harass us, too. The school refused to do anything no matter how many times I reported incidents – I just got bounced between our Title IX office and the student life office. These incidents happened almost once every two weeks for 8 months straight, so my productivity plummeted and I began avoid campus in case anything turned physical. Thankfully, this PhD student has moved on and now I get to pick up the pieces.

I’m so burnt out that it’s hard to even cook food in the microwave, much less actually do my work. I love my research and my advisors are great, so quitting is not an option. Just need some help getting over this hill and none of my colleagues have experienced this, so nobody really knows how to help.

1mpz6kq,"Advice for designing short ""video response"" assignments to be used with in-person classes?","I'm thinking of trying some form of video response/reflection assignments in a class this fall.  Have never attempted it before.  Here's some additional context and some tentative parameters I'm envisioning:

**Class Modality:**  in-person

**Discipline:**  a humanities field

**Class level:** introductory/gen-ed (mainly freshmen and sophomores)

**Class size:** \~25

**Assignment frequency:** weekly (or maybe bi-weekly would be better to avoid student and instructor burnout?)

**What students will be responding to:**  in-class discussions  
(which may include small group discussions, whole class discussions, or some combination)

**Timeframe:**  If a discussion takes place in class on a Monday, students would need to post their video response before the next class meeting on Wednesday

**Assignment Type and Weighting:** formative and fairly low-stakes; assignment category as a whole (for all video responses combined) would be about 10-15% of the total grade

**Assignment Objective:** students should demonstrate that they paid attention and have given some further thought to a few specific points from the discussion

Ex: making a connection from the day's discussion to other assigned materials or discussions from the course; raising further questions; connecting a point from discussion to some aspect of their personal or educational experience; etc..  I have a list of open-ended reflective questions I already ask them to use with assigned readings and other materials that I would modify it to apply for discussion-based reflection so they would have something to use as a guide.

**Time limit for each response:**  3 minutes (is that long enough/too long?)

Would love any advice (including any suggested modifications to my tentative parameters above) from those who have tried this type of assignment, whether the advice is based on a sucess story or a flaming fiasco!

uviay1,Starting 4th year and reflecting on what an absolute joke the past four years have been,"Year one first semester I'm indoctrinated about what a privilege it is to be a doctor. I belong here. I just have to work hard. Admin makes a speech about how they don't understand why empathy decreases and burnout increases during third year but to make sure we don't become that way please prioritize your wellness! Sometime during second semester I starting catching on...

Year two admin tells us if we only use outside resources we will fail. Random vague threats of professionalism to our class as a whole. SPs taking their jobs too seriously after being gone due to the pandemic. I do some research I don't wanna do cause admin tells me to. I don't fail.

Year three the rose colored glasses come all the way off. Why am I shadowing like a premed student for some of my rotations? Why am I comforting my attending who's having a mental breakdown because her husband was mean to her? Yeah, thanks for finally sending me on a 20 min lunch break when the cafeteria is CLOSED. Oh this attending is kind of ok-oh wait nvm they hate gay people. On surgery and obgyn rotations I witness the absolute worst personalities known to man. If this is the best year of medical school, then I am in *trouble*. My feedback culminates to ""the best medical student out of their entire cohort"" to one attending who waited to the final eval ""absolute dog shit of a medical student. Will never pass boards."" Nice! My mental health takes a nosedive. ""You signed up for this."" No, naive 21 year old me signed up to help people. 25 year old me is living with the consequences of 21 y.o. me's actions. The 15 min encounters with my patients when they tell me how precious I am is the only thing keeping me going. Bless them

Year four I crush boards. Now I'm bitter. ""Yeah we set it up this way to build resiliency so you'll be stronger doctors! It was much worse when I went through it though. You all complain too much."" You never see your kids and your spouse hates your guts. I'm not trying to be like you. 

I do love the friends I've made and the field I'm going into (but every fourth year rotation I'm forced to do outside of it is killing me slowly). I'm just quite bothered by the whole ""we're building humanistic, empathetic physician leaders of tomorrow but let's tear their self-esteem down in the process and then query why are medical students are burnt out?""

1djq0tl,It gets better. Trust me.,"Just wanted to write an encouragement post for those of you who are in the midst of this difficult degree with some perspective as someone who defended a few weeks ago.

I absolutely hated my graduate school experience in basic science. Horrible supervision, low resources, COVID, illness, being scooped, failing research models, and self-pressure plagued me for 6 years. I experienced anger, rage, burnout, and frustration to an extreme I couldn't imagine in myself. I couldn't sleep properly for at least a few years. To go from a person who was positive and happy to angry and short-fused was alarming.

I know many people here experience similar thoughts or are somewhere on this spectrum (hopefully better than I was, but some unfortunately have it worse). In my experience it is common that at some point around 4th-5th year most students hit a low point. I know how it feels as if this degree will never end, that it was not worth the effort, that you hate science or want to just open a bakery and be happy.

I promise you that you will be ok. I don't know if I could go back in time and do this degree again. I also can't tell you how I made it through these last 6 years, but I did and you will too. Every day since I have submitted my thesis the stress has started to release. Every day since the defence life gets a little brighter. I feel like I am slowly gaining part of myself I lost in this degree. I am still short tempered, or maybe I just have been through the wringer and refuse to put up with anyone's bullshit. However, even the things that bothered me in the PhD like my supervisor refusing to read my papers are starting to lose their impact. I did my best and earned this degree and then some. I don't have room to care anymore about the past, I am free.

Many PhD students will just not have the conditions needed in their labs to publish in high impact journals, discover a cure for a disease, publish multiple papers, land a stellar post-doc on the first try, feel financially secure, etc. They get frustrated because they aren't making progress, can't publish, can't get guidance from their supervisors, have toxic labs, don't know what is coming next in their careers, can't graduate on their schedule, and their supervisors have no connections to help them. Whether you are at a low ranking or R1 institution, there are garbage labs and supervisors everywhere. Some days it seems your project and you by extension are doomed.

Talk to your friends, refuse to work on weekends, adopt the same attitude your supervisors have (they don't give a flying f\*\*\* about anything and just push deadlines or do everything last minute), and just trust in the process. Everyone graduates eventually, just jump through the hoops and do the maximum you can. If today that means doing only one experiment, writing one page of the thesis, or making one figure, so be it. If that means you do simple experiments instead of grand ones, oh well. All you can do is your best and that is enough. Your supervisor probably has no clue what is happening, they might be expecting the world yet they graduated in the time of hand-drawn graphs and ""trust me bro"" statistics. None of it matters as much as we think it does. If you hate it year 1 or 2, leave the lab and find a new one or a new dream. If you hate your PhD in year 4 or 5, just take it day by day and hobble to the finish line. You will be fine. I promise.

Sincerely,

A recovering Dr.

P.S. I know to those not in graduate school this may sound either crazy or discouraging. Graduate school is harder in ways you have not experienced in undergrad and many face some sort of challenge. That is no reason to be scared! I promise graduate school can be fantastic with the right people around you. I made amazing lifelong friends in my PhD who really pulled me to the finish line. There are also many great supervisors. Don't be discouraged from your dream of completing a PhD and working as a scientist, but know that it will be hard and you will come out the other side ok.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1djq0tl/it_gets_better_trust_me/
1n3rk8i,Probably stupid question about Master's thesis...,"I am struggling with my thesis a ton. I'm in a forensic psych program, and my original idea was to research and survey a jail correctional facility's officers, implement an intervention, and then follow up survey to see if intervention worked. But my time got cut down because I thought I had more time. I won't have time to implement the intervention, but I can still do the survey and see perceptions of the staff on burnout and such. Do I need a program implementation, or can it strictly be ""this is what I found, and I recommend a follow up study utilizing the program""?

  
Essentially, ""collect survey data, explain results, do results allow for the intervention to be a valid use of time, and why should it be done if so"" would be the brunt of my study.

  
I don't know if this makes sense, and my instructors and advisors are no help whatsoever. I'm close to just quitting, but I am also like five-six months from graduating at most (I think).",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n3rk8i/probably_stupid_question_about_masters_thesis/
1iv7npg,Am I truly underestimating myself or am I really not performing at the level I should be at?,"I'm a 5th year PhD in Experimental Psychology who should graduate this May assuming my latest set of revisions goes well. I'm posting today because I met with someone to help me with career options and I got hit with something others in my support circle have told me often, which is that I underestimate myself. I see where they're coming from in this case. However, I also get feedback consistently here on Reddit or elsewhere that indicates I'm behind on something major despite where I'm at now. I'll lay out the argument for those say I underestimate or undermine myself and lay out those arguments who are surprised I'm at where I am now.

Undermining myself argument:

1.) Finding major resources on my own (vocational rehabilitation, support offices, etc.)

2.) My experiences so far

    a.) Soon to be 7 years of research assistant experience

     b.) 2 years of TA course experience

     c.) 1 year of teaching an online section of Research Methods each semester, one semester adjuncting two courses at a community college, and one year visiting full time instructor at a SLAC (all extremely low ratings other than the 2nd semester I taught online)

     d.) Competitive 10 week summer internship at a top 10 research hopsital for children in the country

3.) Writing well (albeit I'm not mindful on Reddit or Discord)

The ""surprised I'm here"" argument:

1.) Managed only one research project at a time throughout graduate school

2.) Only made my own course materials for one of the adjunct courses and one or the visiting full time lecturer courses

3.) Severe autistic burnout after major emotional and professional setbacks (e.g., when my first PhD advisor dropped me 2.5 years ago and I haven't been the same sense). Autistic burnout also applies to how quick I've burned out even after writing and whatnot. Ties into next point

4.) I can only manage 3-3.5 hours of actual work a day at most over these past 2.5 years. I used to work 7 each weekday and 3.5 each weekend my second year of my Master's and first year of my PhD when courses were a thing. After coursework ended though, fairly directionless.

5.) This is the biggest one I saved for last. My parents paid for a life coach to help me with social and study skills throughout undergrad. Note they didn't do my work for me, that'd be unethical. I also got a different coach when I took a gap year to help with Master's program applications before they came back into my life in 2019 for PhD applications. They came back again 2.5 years ago after the incident with my first PhD advisor happened in this case.

6.) No publications

There's other examples I could list in either category, but those are the most salient in my opinion.

After reading this, am I underestimating myself? Or, am I not performing at the level I should be at this point? If there's a third option I haven't considered, I'd like to hear it too.

Edit: Added my PhD field (Experimental Psychology) and the fact I have no publications as point 6 in the ""surprised I'm here"" arguments.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1iv7npg/am_i_truly_underestimating_myself_or_am_i_really/
1grco9v,"I quit PhD today, and give up scholarship","Until now I still do not know if this is the right thing to do, but I listened to the voice in my mind and made the decision.

My background is a bit complicated. I am a phd student in the humanities in the 2nd year. I am from Asia and was admitted to a European university last year. For financial reasons, my PI and I agreed that I can defer one year before officially starting my studies. So I used the time to apply for funding and scholarship. Unfortunately, for the largest funding I was rejected in the final round; however, I was able to secure a scholarship from another source. But somehow this was not enough for me (not precisely financially but more psychologically).

During this one-year period, I kept doubting myself, about the studies and the future after that. I found out that I cannot bear the fact that I need to severely twist my topic to fit the academic ""fad"" (in my home country) so that a funding can become possible. The doctoral project I am looking at right now does not click as it did a year ago. And I cannot help thinking this ""twisting and fitting"" will definitely still be the case if I could graduate and work in academia. So I have been experiencing something I cannot quite describe (burnout? depression? imposter syndrome? maybe pride? or a mixture of all).

I totally understand that MA and PhD are completely different things. But in my MA years, I can spend more than 12 hours, everyday, in library, for 3 years, just to read and learn and write. I eventually generated a 250-page dissertation, reviewed by committee as almost ""PhD-level,"" and won a state-level diss. award. But now, I just feel disgusted and ashamed of my doctoral project. I do not even want to start it and feel that it will be a failure anyway. It is just amazing that how much I have changed. Maybe it is just that I cannot bear the fact that I can be so against the subject I loved once. And that thought kept developing into an action—""it's time to leave PhD.""

Anyway, I quitted today, informed my PI of the news, gave up scholarship, canceled housing booking and visa, everything. Maybe it is time for me to realize that I am not cut out for PhD and academia, professionally and psychologically. Sorry for the venting. But the lesson I learned from this experience is that we have to cherish our passion (I assume after graduation it will become even more important). It used to be one of my greatest strength to push forward, but I somehow lost it on the way. Just be grateful that we are able to love the things we love.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1grco9v/i_quit_phd_today_and_give_up_scholarship/
1le2sfi,"A Idiot’s Guide on How I ""Got Gud"" My Second Year (While Preventing Burnout)","Did you struggle your first year? Are you terrified of second year and boards? Are you unsure if you even belong in medical school? Then this guide is for you. It may even be a good guide if you’re a first year and freaking out about how the hell to do medical school. Having just passed Step 1 and with some time before rotations start, I wanted to do a little (lol) write-up on what my last year was like after almost failing out my first year. Reddit has always been helpful for me when it comes to learning about how to get through medical school, and I want to give back to the community that got me here. I would also like to state that my methods work for ME at a Pass/Fail school, and while I think they could help many other people, they may not work for everyone. I am very open to criticism on this. Most of this post is me pontificating about my experience because I think it can be relatable to many other students who struggle their first year, and I want to show that you can succeed without school being all sunshine and rainbows. I also explain why I used the resources I did, and why they worked for me. Feel free to skip to the bottom if you just want to read the study plan. 



**My Credentials:**

 I currently attend a mid-tier DO school that is Pass/Fail. As I will explain later, my first year went horrifically. I then made a huge leap my second year to the point where I consistently scored above average, and only scored below the 50th percentile on tests where I specifically chose to put my time into other things as I knew I had already passed the course (and didn’t want to learn non-boards-relevant material). I never scored below 80% on a test in my second year. I also did this while averaging 4-6 hours of work (review and new material) per day, which extended to 6-8 hours the day before a test. Please note that this does not count mandatory in-person classes, although I had way less of these my second year compared to my first year. I certainly was not a top student, but I also put far less time into studying (and more time into my hobbies) than many other students. I proceeded to pass my first Step 1 practice test (aka NBME) in April, and passed Step 1 after approximately one month of dedicated in May. 



**My First Year and Summer:**

My first year was absolutely god awful. I failed way more tests than I’d like to admit, and I was consistently scoring within the bottom 5 (and often the absolute lowest) on tests according to Canvas. In fact, I’m pretty sure they changed our grading system in the second semester to explicitly prevent people like me from passing. The one thing I had going for me is that I am a good test taker, which allowed me to scrape by. 



Looking back, my issues were primarily related to discipline and not knowing WTF I was doing. There’s a whole list of reasons I could get into to explain this, but the thing I think is most important to note was that **I did not stick to a consistent study plan.** I was constantly torn between watching school lectures, various third party-resources, and making my own Anki cards versus using Anking. This was exacerbated by the fact that our first semester material seemed to cover a lot of material that was not relevant to boards (anatomy), which nobody on Reddit seemed to mention. As a result, I frequently did not cover all the material before a test, which in turn sent me into a panicking spiral and prevented me from studying well for the next test. As someone who is typically very laid back, I was not used to feeling like this and had no idea how to deal with it. I did not seek help, which I almost definitely should have. 



After barely passing second semester, I decided to take the majority of summer to decompress. I did some side jobs, hung out with friends, and generally thought about anything besides medicine. I realize that a lot of people who are interested in competitive specialties need to be doing things during the summer, so this won’t work for everyone. But I walked out of first year seriously considering quitting school and borderline depressed, and I personally really needed that time to relax. I think more people should seriously consider this as an option if you come out of first year feeling like I did. It helped me realize that 1) I did still want to pursue medicine and 2) I absolutely could do this, but I needed a plan. 



**The Comeback/A Note on Anki:** 

During the second half of my summer, I decided that I was sticking with school and realized I needed to come up with a plan to succeed. Given that Anki had worked well for me during the MCAT and for a few tests my first year, I decided that Anking would definitely be part of the plan. I also liked Sketchy, so I started some light studying by watching a few Sketchy Micro videos per day and doing the associated Anking cards. While I only got through about half the bacteria during summer, this helped me to develop the necessary discipline to do Anki every day. 



I know people have mixed thoughts about Anki, and some swear that it’s a waste of time. I HEAVILY disagree with them. I don’t think you need to optimize every little thing about it like some people do, but I have not found a more efficient review system yet. I can’t make you use Anki, but I would recommend everyone seriously consider if the other methods people try are actually better or just feel easier because they feel like less work despite being less effective. Also, it seemed to me that the people who did not use Anki required significantly more dedicated study time for boards than those who did.  



I also am not a fan of making all my own cards from scratch, if for no other reason than because I am lazy and don’t want to spend a bajillion hours doing this. I genuinely cannot recommend Anking enough. You watch a third-party video, unsuspend the Anking cards for that video with a couple clicks, and you immediately start reviewing. If you want to add a bit more information to a card, you can use the “Lecture Notes” section of the card to do so (just make sure you look up how to “protect” this section from being updated by AnkiHub). IMO this is the most time efficient way to review material while still occasionally writing down the information on your own to really solidify it. There are already a billion posts about how to optimize your Anki usage (FSRS, retention rate, etc) that I’ll get into somewhat in my plan section, but the important thing is to **use Anking and stay consistent with it.** Can it eventually become overwhelming? Hell yes it can, and I address ways to get around this in my plan. 



**THE PLAN**

TLDR: Watch third party resources, do Anking, do practice questions, and skim through in-class material. 



Before anything else, **ask yourself if you are a good test taker or not**. Specifically, are you generally pretty good at multiple choice questions. You should typically be able to rule out at least 2-3 answer choices right off the bat based on the question stem. If you’re not able to do this on a consistent basis, there’s either a knowledge deficit or you’re not a good test taker yet. If you’re not, find a method that works for you. This will arguably be one of the most important things you figure out this year, and will 100% boost your chances of passing boards. 



Also, realize **you can be flexible about WHEN you study!** With the exception of mandatory in-person classes (I am fully of the belief that you should skip most non-mandatory classes), make your schedule your own. I personally liked to sleep in, work out, and chill before studying in the afternoon. Sometimes I would start at 12, sometimes at 2 or 3 PM (if I had morning classes). This should give you plenty of time to do research, exercise, hobbies, and generally not burn out. Anybody telling you that they consistently study 8+ hours is probably not efficient, although I acknowledge that some people need to work harder for the same results. I also like the Pomodoro method, specifically starting with a really low work:break ratio and then working your way up to longer study periods (with shorter periods again at the end of the day). 



**The Materials:** 

* **Anking**. See my above explanation for why I like this, but I cannot recommend it enough. I hate doing Anki, but I give it 90% of the credit for why I did well in my second year. 
   * For a one time payment of $5, you can permanently keep the current version of the Anking version 12 deck without future updates. You could subscribe and pay $5/month for constant updates, but you can also get away with just resubscribing for one month every 6 months to get all the updates. If you want to try for free before paying, the v11 version of Anking is available for free somewhere on reddit (should be easy to find with Google). 
   * You do not need to pay for BnB or First Aid add-ons. While I’m sure these may be helpful, they require paying for the premium Anking subscription consistently and don’t actually seem to offer that much. 
* **Boards and Beyond**: I used this as my primary resource for the majority of my learning. Some people like Bootcamp, but BnB seems to be more completely covered by Anking tags at the moment. I also like that it is easier to take notes on the BnB slides. Pathoma is another great option and I highly recommend reading chapters 1-3 at some point, but it doesn’t cover physiology, biostatistics, biochemistry, and other things that BnB and Bootcamp do. Ultimately it’s up to you, just pick a resource and stick with it while using other resources to fill in any gaps. 
* **Sketchy Micro/Pharm**. I am very much a visual learner, and Sketchy is perfect for this. You see the image and explanation in the video, then hammer it into your brain with Anki, and then you never forget it. You can even skip the BnB pharm/micro videos and just do the Sketchy videos. 
* **UWORLD/AMBOSS Question Bank:** You need one of these for boards studying, and they’re useful tools for studying for in-house tests too. 
* **AMBOSS** **Library**: Not mandatory, but so so helpful. AMBOSS has great explanations that go more in-depth than any of the lecture resources, which can be helpful for more complex topics. 
   * Works best when paired with the Anking and web browser add-ons that add highlight words/diseases on the page/card you’re on and have pop-ups that you can skim through. Very effective for quickly refreshing your memory on a topic. 
* I only looked at school materials as a last resort for situations where third party resources just don’t cover it well (ex. Neuroanatomy, anatomy, auditory system, etc). IMO school lectures will never cover a topic as efficiently or succinctly as third party resources do, and taking the time to actually watch them simply isn’t a good use of time at a pass/fail school. You maybe should eventually look at the powerpoints though, as I explain in my plan below. 



**The Steps** (some of this is copied from previous comments I’ve made):

On any given day, I’ll: 

1. Look at the school schedule to see what’s being covered in lecture. I’ll write down all the topics on a sticky note and cross them off as I cover them. This lets you create a plan and also get a sense of how long you need to work that day. 
   1.  If I’m feeling really motivated/have time, I'll look at the in-house lecture objectives to make sure I cover each topic.
2. Watch the relevant third party videos. I generally follow the school schedule in terms of what I cover each day, but I’ll aim to watch the entire Boards and Beyond section + sketchy for any micro/pharm stuff by the end of the block. 
   1. I personally like to highlight and take a few notes on the B&B slides. This isn’t a requirement, but I find it helps me connect stuff to previous material and actively think through disease processes. 
3. Unsuspend and go through the relevant Anking cards after each video. You do this by going to Browse→ scroll down to Tags→ AK\_Step\_1\_V12→ BnB/Sketchy/whatever → that specific video→ select all the cards and unsuspend.  
   1. Add additional notes to the “Lecture Notes” section of each card as you see fit. I like to write in additional explanations and my own mnemonics
      1. Make sure you look up how to “protect” this section from being updated by AnkiHub. This is not a problem if you’re using the old version 11. 
   2. If the lecture notes section isn’t enough, you can always create and add your own cards to the Anking deck. I did this pretty rarely, but one thing I consistently did it for was things that can be easily comprehended as a flowchart/image. Examples of this include the P53/Rb pathway and the adrenal enzyme pathways. I personally found the image occlusion card type to be perfect for this. 
   3. Keep finding and unsuspending cards even after you’re done with your primary resource (BnB, Bootcamp, Pathoma, First Aid, etc). Each one covers some things that the others don’t, so you can always unsuspend all the cards for a given topic from each resource; however, I don’t necessarily recommend this as you may unsuspend cards that you haven’t covered but that your chosen resource covers in a later video.
4. Figure out a hard cut-off time and stick to it. This prevents burnout. Mine was 9 PM because I started studying so late in the day, but make sure you’re leaving time each day to relax.  

I aim to complete all of the material for a test at least 3-4 days before a test. In the 2-3 days before a test, I then: 

1. Create a Google document explicitly for that test. I use this to review stuff the morning of the test. 
2. (optional): Skim through the school PowerPoints, and take time to read through the portions that weren’t covered by third party. For me, this generally included newer drugs and bugs not covered by Sketchy. I don’t consider this essential because third party resources will cover most of what you need to know, and doing practice questions will fill in the gaps. 
   1. If I find something that wasn’t covered by third party, I’ll search through Anking to see if it has any cards on it. If Anking doesn’t have any cards on it, I add it to the Google doc and forget it after the test cause it probably isn’t boards relevant. 
   2. If you don’t want to do all of this, you can just skim through the lecture objectives to make sure you have at least heard of all of the topics. 
3. DO THE IN-HOUSE PRACTICE QUESTIONS. I normally don’t get to this until the day or 2 before a test, but it’s arguably the most important step because these questions should reflect the style and topics covered by the actual test. 
   1. You may realize while doing these that you didn’t actually cover a given topic during studying. You can correct this by looking through the school lectures, or by seeing if a different third party resource covers it. For example, B&B doesn’t really cover GI nutrient absorption, but Bootcamp has a video dedicated to it. 
4. Go through as much of the AMBOSS/UWORLD/whatever question bank as I can on that topic. Take the time to really review the question explanations for questions you get wrong. This solidifies the material in your brain and gives you an idea of how it’s going to be tested, while also giving you a head start on studying for boards. 

(optional) Morning of the test:

1. Get up early
2. Use the filtered deck option to pull out the cards for the test, and only do those cards
   1. Consider doing this the night before to save yourself time the morning of the test
3. Look through the Google document you made to review the in-house material that wasn’t covered by third party resources



**Preventing Burnout/Making Anki Work For You**

This is probably going to be the most controversial part of the plan, and I accept that it is not perfect. That being said, I am of the belief that a lot of people are too uptight about sticking to Anki perfectly. It is a tool that you should try to stay consistent with, but it does not need to be your entire life. I would also like to again note that I was passing Step 1 practice tests before even starting dedicated, so it’s not going to screw your whole study system over. So here’s a few ways to make Anki work for you:

* Get one of the add-ons that allows you to postpone cards, and use it when needed. Yes this means “you won’t see it on the exact expected day, oh no”! I do not care. Sometimes you need a day off, and that is okay. I especially like to use it to postpone cards on the day of a test, because hell no I’m not studying after a test unless absolutely necessary. Just try not to use it multiple days in a row unless you’re on vacation.
* If you get behind on studying and aren’t using separate subdecks yet (explained later), use filtered decks to prioritize the material for your current block. There are many guides on how to do this, but you’re essentially using tags to pull cards from a given topic into a special deck. I always recommend doing this the morning of a test, but you can also consider doing it if you’re really far behind and still have new material to cover the day or two before the test. After the test, you can try to catch up on all the cards you missed or \*GASP\* postpone them.
* When your daily count starts to become overwhelming, you can consider suspending the lower yield cards. This really gets some people twisted, but frankly you do not need to be reviewing OLD material for 3-4+ hours a day. The number will vary for everyone, but my break point was when I hit 450+ per day on a consistent basis in my second semester. I would get so burnt out on cards that I started covering new material more slowly, which in turn put me behind schedule and made everything worse. 
   * Suspend lower yield cards from OLD material. Go to the tags section and find AK Step 1 V12→ \^Other→\^High yield. This has the cards broken down from low yield to high yield. Start with suspending the low yield, then lower, etc until you’re only doing high yield cards. 
      *  I generally do this at the end of a block so I’m not suspending material from my current block. 
   * If the problem is that you keep getting a card wrong, it might be the card’s problem. Try rewatching a video on the topic, and consider breaking up a really long card into multiple smaller cards (Looking at you, mnemonics cards). If that doesn’t work, just suspend it and move on with your life. 
* Play around with separate subdecks and retention rate. I eventually settled on a subdeck with current material at a 0.9 retention rate, a subdeck with old,high yield cards at 0.87 retention rate, and a subdeck with old, non-high-yield cards at a fluctuating 0.8-8.85 retention rate depending on how I was feeling. 



Some notes:

* We are P/F and have tests every \~2 weeks, with each test having minimal overlap with previous tests. Consider changing the timing of things based on your own school’s schedule.
   * If your school isn’t P/F, decide for yourself how important your grades vs time are. You can probably still follow this plan, but start covering the school material earlier. 
* This plan takes me approximately 4-6 hours per day, which can extend to 4-8 hours in the 2-3 days before a test. This does not include weekends (unless right before a test) and DOES NOT INCLUDE MANDATORY IN-PERSON CLASSES. My school probably averaged around 2 hours of mandatory class per day, although this was highly variable. Adjust your expected time accordingly. 
* There’s a billion different Anki guides on Reddit and Youtube. Use those to fine tune your settings and method. 
* This study method sets you up well for Step 1, but **by second semester you’ll also need to be putting in additional time to study for boards specifically.** I’ll do an additional write up on this at some point, but IMO the best way is to set a minimum number of UWORLD/AMBOSS questions to do daily such that you’ll get through most/all of it by the time you reach your dedicated period. I personally only finished 25% of UWORLD (although I was using AMBOSS for my first 3 semesters) and still passed, but I don’t really recommend this. 
* If you were a terrible student in your first year like I was, you’re probably going to want to review some of the higher yield topics before boards. While a full run-through of B&B and Anking may take too long, I highly recommend watching Dirty Medicine on Youtube. His videos are so high yield that I sometimes wonder if he writes the test questions. Mehlman’s video questions/explanations are also great for when you have downtime (showering, driving,etc), and Dr. Goljan’s lectures on Spotify are great as well (albeit much longer). Adjust as necessary based on how much you actually remember, but note that UWORLD/AMBOSS question explanations are also fantastic teachers and should be prioritized. 
* Remember that medical school is full of smart people. You may not always score above average, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be a fantastic doctor. 



I’d like to end by again stating that this method worked for me at a P/F school. It may not work for everyone, and I am fully open to criticism in the comments. Thanks for reading!

1mixypk,Telling my PI about mastering out,"In a nutshell, I’m currently being assigned a project that has gone through two previous grad students without any results. It’s become a running joke in my group about the “burnout master out” of this project and is now falling on me as an incoming second year PhD student in the US.

I recently make an alternate approach in the project that has given my PI hopes of a “development”, but it has become obvious that this has yielded nothing. However, my PI has flat out told me he wants me to do nothing but focus on this project, despite the history of the project failing for two PhD students. 

Before joining the group, I had been advertised projects related to a whole other focus and would have never joined the group knowing that this would have been my project. I have flat out told my PI I’m not willing to have this as my PhD project but am met with, “just try it for two weeks and then we can discuss.”

At this point, I don’t see any options to move forward other than leaving the program with a masters and pursuing a PhD perhaps outside of the US. I have been flat out told that this is my project now and I will not be offered the resources to pivot. 

There are no other PI’s in my program I am interested in joining, which could be on me for choosing a program based on one advisor.

At this point, I am looking for advice or guidance from others in a similar situation, or if mastering out of a STEM PhD program in the US would harm my career and impact my ability to get a PhD in Europe, for example.

Any advice at this point is appreciated, thanks so much for reading!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mixypk/telling_my_pi_about_mastering_out/
12h5g6m,"PSA, Plz Don't Be Unreasonably Judgmental Towards Patients","I've always been extremely bothered by the assumptions/projections/judgments that some people in medicine place on patients, and seeing it happen so often makes me really want to advocate for patients (when I'm finally not the lowest on the totem pole) and not allow myself to fall into that mindset. Please don't let burnout or bitterness make you like those people because it breaks my heart being the fly on the wall in situations where I see both sides. I've been keeping this rant inside me for a while lmao 

Certain types of people are so quick to label patients hysterical, crazy, rude, annoying, etc who do not deserve it at all. We had a patient who was GOING TO DIE and whose wife was scared and kept asking questions. I cannot stress enough that he was imminently ON DEATH'S DOOR and decompensating horribly. And I heard a [healthcare professional] complain about the wife annoying her to other people, then she went and talked to the wife in a condescending tone and told her to wait and stop asking questions, then walked away and talked with someone in the hallway near the patient and burst out laughing for a while.. while the patient and wife could clearly just hear them chatting and laughing really loudly near their room. The wife wasn't being annoying or problematic. I was there listening to everything. 

I saw a young woman who I thought was nice and was clearly having a lot of anxiety about a pre-existing health condition, but it wasn't really serious and she could go home. Obviously she didn't know that, she came to get reassurance and she was polite. I overheard multiple [healthcare professionals] started complaining about how annoying she was and impersonating her to mock her, saying she's taking up time for no reason and that she needs to go home. 

Just two random recent things that stand out in my mind but there are so many cases where patients get quickly slapped with an ""annoying"" ""problematic"" ""crazy"" label or just shit-talked behind the scenes for weak reasons. It really deeply gets to me. Like please just check yourself before you jump on someone for being annoying and gossip with everyone on the team about it, because then everyone has bias towards that patient. Censored which healthcare professionals did it (they were different both times) bc I don't wanna derail this to dig at certain positions. I've worked in different jobs in healthcare and I've seen all different levels of medical professionals do it, I just realllly don't ever want to become like that. Obviously if someone is actually an asshole, you'll know, and there's enough of actual assholes to go around without projecting onto nicer people!

1k0yh2o,"Realistically, how much time do you actually spend on your thesis/dissertation per day/week?","It's so hard to figure out how much daily time should be spent working on such a massive project in order to finish it and defend by a certain date. I'm afraid of not spending enough time and then having to run myself ragged before defense. On the other hand, I am also afraid of burnout.

I tried to do an eight hour work day for four days a week this semester, but I found that I just ended up procrastinating and being depressed about how much work needed to be done that day and then being depressed that I couldn't hit the 8 hour mark.  I lasted for a month or two trying to do this, but I could not do focused work for that long. (For the other days of the week, I spent two of them on the research work for my assistantship and then took one day off per week.) I ended up in massive burnout, which is kinda where I'm at now.

Maybe I'd be better off trying for 2-3 hours of focused work per day using a Pomodoro timer? Then I could spend the latter portion of the day working on research for my assistantship, since it's a bit easier on my brain (lots of database management).

1n168c9,Moving across country for grad school and feeling sick about it,"I just moved from Oregon to Massachusetts for grad school. I’ve moved far away before, once, for a job in another country, but I was desperate then to get out of my abusive fathers house (I was 21F then and I am 24F now). 

I’m just so scared and sad and nervous? I’ve been crying non-stop. I don’t have friends, family, or a partner over here. It’s my first time in the East Coast. I don’t have support.


I know I literally only completed one day, but I already feel so overwhelmed. I’m working a GA 20-hour week, on top of a clinical, and three grad classes. I know that I’m going to be stressing out. I already am. I don’t even know if I want to major in what I’m studying. I’m hardcore second-guessing my degree and career path. 

I feel under-qualified, like an imposter, not good enough, etc. I’ve been working non-stop for years, hustling, and I’m tired and don’t want to go to school or work. But I feel like it’s maybe burnout from previous jobs or just nerves. 

I just wanna quit and go back home where it’s safe. I know I can get through this. But I’m just so overwhelmed. I miss my mom and siblings and grandparents so much.

1m96b58,Hit the wall at work,"A cry for help and advise.

I am a university professor from Russia . After I graduated with honors from my undergraduate program,  i immediately started working full-time as a lecturer, while simultaneously persuing my master's and actively engaging in  top-tier research.


I used to be able to teach five classes in a row from 9 am to 6pm , without a break for food or even the bathroom, then go to my own evening courses until 9 pm, come home, eat, and start doing homework... and, honestly, I felt... fine...

But now I feel like I’ve hit a wall... In 2023, during my third year of teaching, after a series of unpleasant events, I fell into a completely miserable state: I kept working on two major research projects, teaching a huge number of courses—basically plugging every hole I could—and studying in a PhD program. Sometimes I wouldn’t sleep for 48 hours straight and just work-work-work. At the same time, I didn’t even have the energy to shower (yes, I didn’t care that I stinked), I became easily irritable, flinching at every noise, and more... In December the whole month I worked with a 39°C fever because I was afraid of letting the students down—after all I get at least some kind of life energy  when I’m with them, and I feel like my life has some kind of meaning (since, no matter how hard I worked, I was constantly being told by my higher-up that I wasn’t doing enough—something I later realized was partly because I didn’t complain and never told them I was pulling all-nighters to meet their deadlines—but that’s a whole other story). And I think that was the final strow that broke my back: even though most of my teaching load ended by the end of 2023, and I finally had some time to take care of myself, I still felt like I was drowning in some kind of deep swamp... it was incredibly disheartening.

The summer of 2024 I spent basically without a vacation, dealing with some family issues and wrapping up research projects (I didn't visit my hometown even once during summerto see my parents—there just wasn’t time). And now, in 2025, my entire legally allotted vacation, my whole summer, is being eaten up by writing this pointless brick of a dissertation.

Why is it taking me so long to write? Because No matter how hard I try, it feels like I’m slogging through some very dark wasteland—Iam writing actively, using up energy I have left into it, but it takes me three times longer than it should... which means no rest this year either.

 I even considered taking academic leave—if only this weren’t the very final stretch of my PhD.
As is often the case with teachers, I’m constantly sick, constantly tired, and my mood swings wildly. Overall, I don't feel bad ALl the time  yet I feel like all the joy I experience now does not compare at all to 2021–2022, because everything I feel is like... in a fog.

I’ve heard that in Europe, one can  take a  temporary disability  due to depression... unfortunately, that is not possible in my country, 'cause people with mental illness record are prohibited from teaching. Which is why I have no idea what I can do in this situation, because I don’t want the repeat of 2023, when I lived in constant paranoia that I was being watched, with a clogged toilet full of shit I kept going to and defecating until it over-poured anyways because I literally did not have the capacity to get up and fix it—but I still kept showing up to classes and trying to smile... 

The upcoming academic year looks like it won’t be that difficult: I will not have any big research projects, no more PhD obligations after defending in the fall. And when I am writing it, I even feel like I can wait one more like this and take it thru,  But I don't know

I am honestly, jealous of my classmates—those who could afford not to work from their third year of undergrad onwards let alone those whose parents allowed them to take time off between life stages to recover. I am jealous of western people who don't have five years of teaching experience by 26 and are not expected to yield q1  articles by then.

Right now, it feels like this career has eaten away several years of my life for nothing and just led me into a deep, empty nowhere, but there is no alternative rout I can take. 

I don't know. Have anyone been in this situation? How can i escape this?

bbzxxa,UNCOMMON college tips for continuing students and incoming freshman/transfer,"So I know there are a lot of post that give tips about college, academically and socially. A decent amount of those post mention a lot of the same tips/advice. After almost getting done with my junior year of college I thought I shared some tips that I don’t see on here often and just stuff to expect that most people wouldn’t(applies mainly for incoming freshman or CC transfers to uni). If any of you have any tips that aren’t super common, ex; joining clubs, studying, don’t skip class, etc., definitely comment to help out others.

1. Making a legit calendar or journal that you plan to follow saves so much stress in the long run. I see people with planners a lot but they mainly just use it to write down as a  “what to do” when ever they plan to do assignments, studying, etc., If you actually sit plan specific date and time for certain things college will go very smooth. This helps me mainly because I work and am a dj outside of college. My schedule gets crazy and I used to stress but immediately when I started doing the date and time process, things got so less stressful.

2. It’s okay to say “fuck it” a few weekends of the semester and just enjoy life rather than studying or doing college work. This may seem like bad advice but everything is good in moderation. Sometimes you just wanna say screw it and lounge around all weekend or go hang with your friends all weekend. As long as you don’t have a midterm or a major exam early in the next week, I think it’s okay and healthy to have this mentality here and there.

3. Greek life is not what everyone thinks it is.... this one is pretty common and everyone really does have their own personal experiences with fraternities/sororities so I’ll just say that Greek life for me personally was a drama oriented waste of my time. I’m not gonna sit here and say their is no benefits of Greek life because there definitely is.

4. This is the main reason I actually made this post but for all of us who didn’t have the “best” high school/past experiences, people end up talking about high school a lot more than you think they would. After being a looser, burnout, Loner type of kid, I was really excited about college because people make it seem like none of that stuff matters. Well when I got to my uni, it was not how I imagined. People talk about high school a lot but it’s mainly because thats their past and they don’t know what else to talk about and you can’t really blame them. People used to tell me “this is just a early college thing”, it’s not I’m friends with tons of upper level undergrad and even grad students that are always bringing up the good ole days. I am left out of many conversations because of this but at this point, I don’t really care anymore because that’s just life. It does suck but you have to get over it at some point.

So that’s it but definitely comment if you have any other tips or experiences that aren’t posted on this sub often. Also feed back would be great especially on 4",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bbzxxa/uncommon_college_tips_for_continuing_students_and/
1kvxv5l,PhD in Nordic country,"Is it normal to feel frustrated by the PhD recruitment system in Europe?

I’m honestly so frustrated and emotionally drained. I’ve been applying to multiple funded PhD positions across Europe, spending countless hours tailoring applications, writing research statements, and preparing for interviews all while being unemployed as I just graduated from Master degree in the end of 2024.

Meanwhile, I see some PhD candidates especially non-EU people who are applying for unfunded PhD study rights mostly just to stay in Europe. No judgment on survival tactics, but it feels unfair when I’m doing everything “by the book” and still not getting anywhere. I'm non-EU myself and it feels exhausting to watch people use the system this way while the rest of us are stuck trying to survive academically and financially.

The whole process is starting to feel more toxic now than intriguing. The committee hire those unfunded PhD for the pilot (government funding) and salaried position. The selection criteria feel inconsistent, not inclusive and transparent. Some of my interviews went great but still end in silence or rejection. I feel like I’m losing my motivation to apply as soon as I learned who get accepted. Often, they're affiliated with that institution or Associate professor from Asian countries 🙃

1lz3gwi,"Been out of teaching for 10 years, was asked to come back.","I taught intro and historical geology as an adjunct for about 15 years at a large state university with a geology dept that was undergrad only. I have a “day job” as a professional geologist. I started as a TA in grad school in 92, and I pretty much taught straight through MS and PhD, and then as an adjunct 2 years after I finished. I really enjoyed teaching, and there were always a couple of students who made it worthwhile.

About 10 years ago I resigned from teaching. Part of it was burnout, and the students seemed less and less interested in class/lab with a phone and laptop to distract them. The last two semesters I taught, I didn’t have a single student make it worthwhile to teach.

I’m passionate about Internal Medicine. I loved it during med school and naturally, I considered pursuing an IM residency in but now I’m filled with doubts and need honest opinions.

I don’t cope well with night shifts or sleep deprivation- my performance drops significantly.

I get very anxious in high-pressure, fast-paced settings, especially when managing very sick patients. 

Multitasking overwhelms me

Why you should become a neurosurgeon. An Attending’s Perspective


Background: 

What is your medical background(DO, MD, MBBS, etc)?  MD

What type of med school did you go to? Supposedly Top-10 though I don’t think there was anything special about my education.  It probably helped me match though

What were your interests during training? I wanted to be a badass brain tumor surgeon/skull base surgeon and maybe a chairman someday.

Where are you currently practicing? I’m in private practice.  I’m not a badass.  I will never be a chairman anywhere.  I still do some brain tumors.

What type of setting do you practice in now(rural, community, academic, etc)? Community private practice.  Mostly spine. Some brain.  A little trauma.

Anything else you would like to share?  I am 10+ years out of training.  So I am old.  I realize that you reading this is like me trying to read Canterbury Tales in Olde English.  I’m sorry that I couldn’t fit all of this into a TikTok video with a funny dance.  Lastly, what’s with all the memes?



Residency: 

What type of residency did you do? Standard US 7 year residency.

 Is conducting research an important part of your field?  Probably.  I did some research prior to residency which probably helped me match.  I did some “clinical” and “translational” research during my junior and senior residency years.

Any additional thoughts?  My junior resident years were the best/worst of times.  I learned more and did more during my PGY2-4 years than any other period of my life.  This was before the 80 h work week rules kicked in, so the hours were incredibly long, but the foundation of my entire career was built in those 3 years.  I know that everyone in this sub is focused on residency; I would try to encourage you to also look long term.  It’s a marathon not a sprint.  I certainly am showing my age here, I know.



Fellowship(if applicable): 

What type of fellowship did you do? I did a BS enfolded research fellowship for 1 year.  I spent the majority of that year helping to cover our growing neurosurgery service and moonlighting and not researching.  

Any additional thoughts?  The best thing that happened during fellowship was that I made enough moonlighting to nearly pay off all of my med school loans. YMMV.

There’s a lot of variety in neurosurgery fellowships nowadays, which is great.  Most are only one year:

Cerebrovascular/Endovascular:  I want to be a catheter jockey, but I also want to be known as a brain surgeon

Pediatrics: I want to someday separate craniopagus twins and maybe the director of HUD

Spine: I either want to focus on minimally invasive spine so as to inflict the least amount of pain to my patients, or I want to focus on deformity surgery and inflict that maximum amount of pain thru the maximum amount of invasiveness.

Functional:  I am really smart.  I can talk for hours at a time about every individual thalamic nuclei.  Also, maybe my hands aren’t so good. And I’m sure my spouse is fine renting an apartment for the next 10 years.

Neurointensivist: My training program broke me and I don’t want to operate anymore.

Skull base: I like to report my outcomes in terms of percentage of still functional cranial nerves.

Tumor/Oncology:  GBM killed a loved one of mine and now I need to destroy it.

Peripheral Nerve: why?, just why?



Typical Day: 


How is your typical day structured hour-by-hour?  
Right now I probably average about 60 hrs a week. Maybe more on call weekends or with busy calls


Typical outpatient day? 
Up by 530. At work by 7.  Inpatient rounds then clinic starts at 8.  The pain is usually over by 330. Finish charting by 4:30, hopefully.  Then afternoon rounds, see any consults if it’s a call day, administrative meetings (I’m on a few hospital committees and I’m a poor man’s CFO for our practice). 2.5 days a week of clinic per week


Typical OR day? 
At work by 630 to round.  The phone calls and texts already started around 6.  OR starts at 730.  Usually 2.5 days per week.  Could finish as early as 2 or 3 pm.  Could be 7pm or later.  It just depends on how many cases we have scheduled, how efficient the ORs are running and if there are any delays/cancellations/emergencies.  Postop rounds, phone calls, consults, see unplanned admissions.

Usually something comes in over the weekend or during the week.  Either thru the ER or a partner who needs help with a case or a post op complication or one of my referring docs with an urgent case.  We somehow squeeze that in to the above schedule.


What are your days like now that elective cases are cancelled?  
Work by 7.  Floor Rounds - I find a nurse and ask her why she’s trying to kill my patients.  She then informs me that I don’t have any patients on the floor.  I take the long way around to the OR so that I can avoid walking thru the ICU, cause that’s where the patients with the ‘rona are.  I walk thru the OR and make unreasonable demands about case staffing and equipment for my one level ACDF even though I don’t have any cases scheduled - have to keep everyone sharp.  Having finished a whole days work in a mere hour I then speed home in my Mclaren so I can homeschool my toddlers.  Today’s topic: cranial nerves V-XII.  Pop quiz on the circle of willis and I swear my oldest better perfect that two handed tie before he starts showing off the left handed one hand tie.  Kids!?!?! Then I drink beer and get on Reddit.



Call: 

What is your call schedule like?  
I take one call weeknight per week.  It’s pretty light but there are inevitable phone calls to look at films.  Mid levels take the first calls and filter everything before it gets to me.  I have to physically go in to do an emergency case or assess a patient maybe every 4th or 5th call.  I take about 6-8 weekends a year, Friday-Sunday.  We get paid pretty well for call.  About $2k a day.  Most places I know of offer between $1k to $4k

What is the typical call schedule like in your field/residency/fellowship? 
I don’t remember the specifics of call during residency, but there was a lot.  After the junior resident years though, you could start taking call at home.

How are others doing it?  
I don’t do stroke.  We have a separate call schedule for stroke.  Those guys can be very busy in middle of the night



Lifestyle: 

How do you feel about the lifestyle in your field?  
Well it’s certainly better than it was in residency.  I actually think my lifestyle is pretty good despite the long hours.  I see my kids nearly every night for an hour or two before they go to bed.  I usually have a few hours to myself after they go to sleep. Sometimes more.  When I’m off, well I’m off.  We have enough coverage in our practice that the on-call team takes care of everything.  I don’t have to travel away from family if I don’t want to.  Plus, being in private practice, I make my own schedule.  I don’t have to answer to a chairman, program director, dean...etc.  I take as much or as little vacation as I want.  Last year I took 4 full one week vacations with the family and it was fabulous.  It’s nice also taking the family out for a great vacation or the wife for a fancy date night and not having to worry about the cost.  That’s a big upgrade from residency.

I am looking towards going to a 4-day a week schedule at some point, probably in 5 years and I may drop off of the call schedule at that time.  

The more cranial/vascular/trauma that you do, the more often things go bump in the middle of the night.  I can’t function very well with zero sleep anymore.  I need a good 3-4 hours at my age to be functional the following day.

Do you feel burned out frequently?  
I do and it’s definitely worse for me the older I get and the more I would rather be spending time with my kids than in the hospital.  When I start feeling the crunch I just have my office start moving things around to get me some time off.

Do others in your field feel burned out?  
I’m sure they do.  When I was a resident we use to refer to it as “weakness” but now I recognize that’s it the start of burnout.




Income: 


What is the typical income for someone in your field(Starting vs mid-career)?  

I think it depends what subspecialty, country/state, and academic/private/employed.  Cerebrovascular is the money king right now and if I was a new fellowship trained endovascular grad I don’t think I would even look at anything less than $750k in my area.  Academic usually pays lower, but I think that gap is smaller than its ever been (anecdotal - no data to back this up).  My starting guaranteed salary was $500k with some incentives.  Partners in our practice currently make from $300k (older partner working part time) to $1.8 Million (busy cerebrovascular).  I’m somewhere in the middle, but the numbers vary year to year since I’m in private practice.  With the current pandemic, our numbers will certainly be down this year.



Career outlook: 


What is the current demand of your field? Very good

Where are the jobs? 
Everywhere.  Everyone is looking for endovascular neurosurgeons so that their hospital can be stroke certified.  Everyone wants busy spine surgeons since their revenue often drives hospital profits.  Building a children’s hospital? You will probably need two pediatric neurosurgeons to build a practice and take call.  If you want to go live in the middle of nowhere you can make bank. Desirable locations are going to be a bit tougher.

How will this change going forward?  
I think demand will remain high.  There is still a shortage of neurosurgeons and the scope/variety of our cases is expanding.  Residency programs are not graduating that many more surgeons.  Plus, many of the current graduates don’t want to work 60-80 hours out of residency (not a knock on this generation, just an observation) so you might need more than one fresh grad to replace some of the busy older surgeons.

How do you expect your field to evolve in the next 10 years?  
I think you will see more employed neurosurgeons or those working on RVU based contracts.  Small to medium sized private neurosurgery practices will cease to exist.  I think that cerebrovascular will continue to grow, but the growth will slow.  In spine, I think we will see a lot more robotics and image guided surgery making cases easier but with more setup time.  Although it might seem paradoxical, we will also continue to see more complex deformity surgery.  Overall, though spine reimbursement will continue to go down.  I hope that in the future that DBS and other functional cases start reimbursing better.  

Next 20 years?  Who knows.  I try not to think that far ahead.  Bold predictions: Alzheimer’s still untreatable, the first prion based CJD like pandemic, robotics “cures” paraplegia following spinal cord injury, Sen. Ivanka Trump defeats Sanjay Gupta, MD to become the first woman US president.



Reason to do/What type of people like neurosurgery:

What type of people go into your field? 

People who love neuroanatomy/neuroscience but also want to be on the frontlines of patient care, people (like me) who fall in love after seeing their first brain surgery, people who want to do a surgical subspecialty but still want to do a “variety” of cases, people who want to be clinical but also do meaningful translational research, people who have siblings that are rocket scientists, sociopaths.

What do the physicians in your field enjoy about their work(procedures, continuity, inpatient/outpatient, etc)?  

I can only really speak honestly for myself here.  I am someone who can do the same thing over and over again and still find some small nuance/detail/challenge that keeps me interested.  I didn’t really play video games or sports too much growing up, but one thing I noticed was that if I found a glitch/cheat in a game or a weakness in my opponent that I could exploit, I would just keep exploiting it slowly modifying it to perfection — and somehow that was enjoyable to me.  I have done nearly a thousand ACDF procedures since I started practice but I am alway trying to refine my technique and that challenge still brings me joy.  I enjoy helping people get better too, I’m not a total sociopath, but what keeps me going on a day to day basis is really the continuous honing of a rare complex craft.


Downsides of /What type of people don’t like Neurosurgery:  

What type of people don’t go into your field? 
It’s certainly not for everyone.  If you don’t see yourself working more than 40-50h/week on a regular basis then I certainly would not even consider neurosurgery.  If you don’t like surgery, that would be an obvious no. If you like surgery but you don’t like long cases, I guess that would be a no also.


Other Notes: Anything else you would like to share regarding your specialty that is important to know?

It’s a great field.  I still love it though maybe not as much as when I was a junior resident.  The hardest part is probably matching and the training.  If you can make it thru the training it affords opportunities that not many other specialties offer.

1l126gq,"Help me choose between Gas, EM, and Psych","Current M3 halfway through rotations and find myself struggling with this question. Each has pretty major pros and cons that make it tough to decide

**Anesthesia**: I like short procedures, I like the OR but don’t want to be a surgeon, working with the coolest drugs we’ve created sounds really fascinating, career longevity is great, but I can’t give up the feeling that I would regret not being a doctor that treats disease and helps cure people. Also, attending/residency rigor is something I’m taking into account because M3’s hours have taken a toll on me and this seems like the most strenuous of the 3. I worry that the job market and pay will not be what it is today by the time I’m practicing, though I do have connections in this field.

**EM**: I like short procedures, I feel fulfilled helping people in acute settings, I value helping the underserved which EM certainly does a lot of, I function best in an “on when i’m on, off when I’m off” schedule, and the 3 year residency is appealing but I can’t help but be scared by the high burnout, frequent night shifts, and legal liability. I look at EM and don’t necessarily think it would burn me out, but my lack of experience means some of you might have better insight than me. 

**Psych**: I find psychopathology very interesting, I think that the pharmacology of psych is very cool, there are a variety of potential practice settings which interests me, and it certainly is the most “lifestyle” of the three but I don’t want to spend my whole career simply titrating meds and I think that listening to people discuss difficult issues in their life without being able to make any real intervention might trouble me. Also, the idea of never working with my hands and giving up a lot of the medicine I’ve learned turns me off a bit. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1l126gq/help_me_choose_between_gas_em_and_psych/
1lcji70,Pulm/crit vs Psych?,"
I'm at a crucial point in my career planning and trying to solidify my specialty choice. I've narrowed it down to two distinct but equally compelling fields: Pulmonology/Critical Care and Psychiatry



Why Pulm/crit appeals to me:

-Intellectual Stimulation: Fascinated by complex physiology, diagnostics, and immediate impact in critical situations + being the jack of all trades and not dealing with only one organ system 

-Procedural Aspects: Appreciate the hands-on nature and tangible satisfaction of procedures (bronchoscopy, intubation, lines).

-Acute Care Focus: Drawn to the high-stakes, fast-paced ICU environment and bringing patients back from the brink


Why Psychiatry appeals to me:

-Deep Human Connection & Empathy: Profoundly drawn to understanding the human mind, emotional complexities, and individual life narratives for transformative patient interaction

-Holistic Approach: Appeal of addressing biological, psychological, social, and spiritual facets of health.

-Personal Connection: I value deep listening and collaborative therapy

-Longitudinal Care: The idea of long-term therapeutic relationships and witnessing growth is very appealing


My Current Considerations/Concerns:

-Pulm/Crit Concerns: Burnout potential from intensity, demanding on-call, frequent death exposure

-Psychiatry Concerns: Emotional toll of constant exposure to severe psychological distress + the possibility of losing touch with the rest of medicine and forgetting it with time

I'm empathetic, highly analytical, and resilient. I thrive in challenging environments but also deeply value personal well-being and a rich internal life (work-life balance matters to me). I want to develop both intellectual and interpersonal skills, and be able to put them into good use for treating patients

Any insight would be truly appreciated! Thank you

1kyv2e8,Cardiology/Interventional Cardiology vs Gen Surg — PLS help me lol,"So I’m currently debating between these three: Gen Surg (not planning to subspecialize), cardiology, and Interventional cardiology. I'm gonna start clinicals and I need to start getting my stuff together. I’ve always been super interested in surgery. I love the idea of operating, fixing things with my hands, instead of just sending our referrals for other surgeons to operate instead.

BUT I’ve also heard horror stories about the lifestyle in Gen Surg-- crazy hours, burnout, strained family life. And honestly, I **really** value time with my family and having at least **some** control over my schedule. I don’t want to be completely consumed by work to the point where I regret it later in life bc Im just a working robot

I heard Cardiology (esp general) is easier to break into private practice and make your own hours eventually. Gen Surg, on the other hand, Ive heard is way more hours, pressure, and expectations. I love surgery as a field, but I’m scared I’ll hate the *life* that comes with it. And let’s be real… who’s gonna hire a part time general surgeon? 😭

That made me start looking into Interventional cards-- still procedural, less “cutting people open,” but more control maybe? Downside is… the training is SO long. Like 3 years IM + 3 Cards + 2 Interventional?? Idk man. 😩

I also don’t know much about IM residency lifestyle compared to Gen Surg. Are the hours *actually* better in IM? How are things during and after general Cardio and Interventional fellowships?

So yeah...

* Is Gen Surg (5 yrs) worth it if I want a manageable work/life balance after?
* Would interventional Cards be just as bad hours-wise?
* Should I just do General Cards and call it a day?? 😭😭

1mhgqfh,"Landed my dream job, now wondering if grad school is worth it?","Hi all, I recently landed what truly feels like a dream job—an entry level role with a well known non-profit. The mission deeply resonates with me, and the work aligns perfectly with my long-term goal of making a meaningful impact in healthcare. It’s a salaried position, fully remote, and feels like the kind of job I would’ve wanted after grad school. There is room for growth in the organization, but I don’t want to depend on that. The role is entry level so I would need to move up for long term financial stability. So now I’m sitting with the question: Should I still do grad school right now?

For context:
- I’m starting my MSW online, fully asynchronous, this fall through the University of Kentucky, full time. Classes start August 25.
- My new job starts September 22, the initial training (remote) runs for 10 weeks, then I begin job duties. 
- I applied to the program before I got this job offer, mostly to expand my future options and move away from burnout-heavy frontline case management.

My original reasoning for going back to school was:
- I wanted more clinical skills, especially for medical, legal, or forensic social work.
- I was wanted long-term career growth, security, and higher salary.
- A lot of roles I’m interested if I leave my company in like palliative care, hospital social work, or remote behavioral health require or strongly prefer an MSW.
- I was feeling stuck, and school felt like a forward path.

But now, with this new job, I’m wondering:
- Should I just focus on excelling in this role and put school on hold?
- Or is it better to push through school and get my MSW while I have the ability: I’m currently single, no kids, working remote.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this?

Appreciate any insight—especially from folks in healthcare, policy, or remote social work roles. I’m open to adjusting timelines but don’t want to burn myself out or close off future doors.

Thanks in advance.

12gnhby,just wanted to say fuck 3rd year,"I've been out of med school for 5 years and am about to finish fellowship. Gonna finally start making good money for the things I enjoyed doing during medical school rotations. Almost forgot about this account until my cofellow and I commiserated on how much we hated 3rd year a few days ago.

For all those who are struggling during your clinical rotations and are feeling like nothing is going right, residents/fellows/attendings are shitting on you for no good reason, feeling the burnout, can't stand your colleagues who are taking all the patients and kissing major ass to attendings, are on OB/GYN or gen surg and can't fucking stand it, I feel you. I was a 3rd year student too, along with many others who ended up graduating medical school and successfully completing a residency.

Don't give up! The people and things that are making you feel like shit now will be insignificant a year from now when you are an official MD. Find what you enjoy, just acknowledge you have a bunch of other shit to get through, and focus on what part of medicine actually makes you happy and looking forward to being a doctor.

Ended up saying more than just ""fuck 3rd year"" but figured anyone who was in my position about 6 years ago could use some words of encouragement. Definitely helped me when I was a 3rd year student to know I wasn't the only one who struggled.

1l1bw8e,Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting a PhD Abroad,"Hey everyone,  
I’m putting together a few insights that I wish I had known before starting my PhD abroad. Whether you're applying to programs in Europe, the US, or elsewhere, these might help someone out there navigating similar challenges:

1. **Understand the Funding Model Early:** Not all PhD programs abroad are fully funded. Some include stipends and tuition waivers, others don't. Always ask about what's covered especially living expenses.
2. **Know Your Rights as a PhD Student:** In some countries, PhD students are considered employees. In others, you’re more like a student. This impacts things like contracts, working hours, and supervision expectations.
3. **Build a Support Network from Day 1:** Isolation hits harder abroad. Try to join writing groups, attend workshops, or find accountability buddies online or locally. It makes a huge difference.
4. **Supervisor Fit Matters More Than Prestige:** A famous university won’t save you from a toxic supervisor. Choose someone who supports your research goals and communication style.
5. **Document Everything:** From emails with your supervisor to lab notes, keeping records can save you from confusion or disputes later.
6. **It's Okay to Take Time Off:** Burnout is real. Don’t fall into the “I have to work 80 hours a week” trap. Quality matters more than hours logged.

1ljid3j,25|F I think I’ve hit rock bottom and I just needed to let this out,"I'm 25 and studying at the Faculty of Medicine. It was my dream to get into med school, and I fought really hard to make it happen. It took me 3 years of trying, and when I finally got in, I felt like I had made it. But then I had to repeat a year. And now, just when I was about to start my final year, I failed an exam for a completely stupid reason, and it was entirely my fault. Because of that one exam, my graduation is being delayed by another 5–6 months. I even had a minor anxiety attack at school because everything just came crashing down at once.

What makes this even harder is that I didn’t come from a background of hardship. I didn’t have to sacrifice everything for medicine. I didn’t face financial struggles. My family has always supported me, and they still try their best to lift me up. And yet, here I am constantly failing, feeling like a spoiled and stupid person who doesn’t deserve the chances I’ve had.

I cry a lot lately. And every time I scroll through this subreddit and see people going through similar struggles fighting their way through depression, burnout, anxiety, academic pressure it honestly makes me angry at myself. Because they’re doing it. And I’m not. I feel like I don’t work hard enough to belong in med school. Like I’m falling short of something that was once my biggest dream.

I’ve never been in love, never had a relationship. I had feelings for one person once, but we had zero communication. He's graduating this year, and I just feel like I’m falling behind in every part of life. My friends are starting to figure things out, and I feel stuck, anxious, and always late to everything emotionally, academically, socially.

I don’t even know what I need right now. Maybe I just needed to tell someone, because holding it in is getting too heavy. I’m not even sure if this post belongs here, but I just felt like I had to write it. Somehow, I thought I needed to.

1jdsp9y,HELP picking a specialty,"Okay hello! Sorry in advance for the long post, but I am freaking out. I am from a T5 school with a good step score and really feel all over the place in terms of specialty. I even took a research year to figure it out but I'm just not sure what to do. I keep thinking about what my 40 year old self would want (derm?) but I just don't feel like I had the ""AHA"" moment that I keep hoping for. I am an extrovert who likes interesting things and maybe some chaos and enjoys having fun, but also doesn't want to work too hard and appreciates routine as well. I also want to have a family and not feel like I am always RUNNING or stressed about going to work, as I have went straight through to a top school and have always felt like my life was a big rush. I appreciate any help or guidance, truly :) I am forcing myself to decide by the end of this week. The specialties in med school I liked in alphabetical order:

\- Derm: been to AAD (those free samples) and presented there a few times. I am currently on my research year in dermatology with wonderful and kind mentors but I also have family members who applied into it and I think that's a big factor into my interest. Additionally, everyone and their mother says if I have the scores for it and could see myself doing it, do it bc my 40 year old self would thank me and I see the endless reddit posts that ""derm is a unicorn."" That being said, I really do enjoy the tiny procedures of biopsies, steroid injections, cryotherapy etc. I am not a procedure kind of person in the sense that >15 minute procedures and fine tuning stuff really bore me (no ophthalmology); however, I enjoy working minimally with my hands. I feel like the time I spent in derm outpatient clinic always goes by wonderfully fast. Also I LOVED derm consults and was pretty invested. I think that's also because it's **easy** in the sense that I don't feel overwhelmed often the way I do about the endless bounds of IM, because there's a finite amount of treatments. So I'm not sure if I really adore it, or it's just easy and then very likely in a few years will be **boring**. I am the person who gets bored kind of easily, and I'm not a serious person, so I don't really want to be bored. But I also really don't know about IM and all because I am not a workhorse and didn't like rounding for hours and hours (my program does all standing rounds on olds and news and im not sure if that's standard for other programs, considering my program is a top workhouse program). I have my letters all lined up and applied for aways, but not feeling certain and don't want to apply into something just because it has the best lifestyle. But I do have the scores and research and mentors for it, so I'm not sure if I'm just being an idiot by not going for it. I also have a partner in a tough residency right now and I don't want to feel like less of a doctor/inferior to them/always home by myself lol. Could also use some advice on dual applying derm and IM and how to do that if people think that's the move.

\- Emergency med: pediatric emergency was probably my favorite rotation tied with psych. I only did it for a few weeks but it was super fun and awesome. I am worried about the burnout rate, lower salary, and nights. I also would want relationships with my patients. I appreciate though how if you don't know something, you can consult. With that being said, I know they have the highest burnout rate and I really don't want to miss out on weekends and stuff as an attending. But I like the procedures and the ""little bit of everything"" and I love the chaos sometimes lol. it's just hard because I'm not sure ill still love that as an attending the way I loved it as a med student because if I didnt know something the resident would help, but as an attending the job can seem very stressful of course and maybe my 40 year old self would want something more predictable. Also this sounds bad but if I have great scores, not sure if I should do something more competitive. Could also do anesthesia but missing long term follow-up, and I am an extrovert as well so I enjoy talking with patients.

\- Internal medicine: could see myself doing GI. Enjoyed rotating at an outside hospital in IM, but didn't like my workhorse program that made me do a bunch of nights in a row. Kind of a bucket because I feel like I have a lot of interests and can do procedures like GI or do skin stuff in rheum. But I'm not sure how bad life will be in residency because again my program is a workhorse program where residents come in on gen medicine at 4:45 AM. I just really don't want to work so hard that I feel stressed about going to work even on days I am off. But I really enjoy the team aspect and working in the team room, bonding with co-residents and having a mix of inpatient and outpatient time, derm is missing this in terms of inpatient time and team rooms of co-residents.

\- Peds: Old people sometimes make me sad and are smelly. My FAVORITE age group is truly like 15-35. Which is why I could do adolescent medicine and enjoy the psych and peds part of it. I could see myself doing like peds cards too or something fun like that to work with perinatal moms. But peds is also like a bucket option. I really liked my peds rotation and felt like for the most part it was super pleasant (we even had 2 deaths while I was there and went to one of the my patient's celebration of life, and found that that was also super meaningful to help the parents through some of the worst times of their life, it was very touching and very moving). I came into medical school thinking peds and have always gravitated towards working with children. I prefer them a bit older, but babies are also so cute. Again, I really enjoy the team aspect and working in the team room, bonding with co-residents and having a mix of inpatient and outpatient time, derm is missing this in terms of inpatient time and team rooms of co-residents. However, the low salary has me wondering if 40 year old me will kick myself when I had the resources to apply derm.

\- PM&R: I had an injury for years that was helped only by PM&R and ortho and years of PT. I shadowed PM&R for sports medicine and also general PM&R and really enjoyed my time. I am very interested in sports and mobility (and alllllll of my hobbies are sports and running and working out) so I like the work of it. Additionally, I like the tiny procedures like injections and needling and the patient follow-up. But again with higher scores and coming from a top school, I don't know if I should aim somewhere else. I just go to clinic and im like oh this is cool I could do this, the same way I feel about derm kinda.

\- Psych: so this was my first clinical rotation coming from pre-clinical years and it was on eating disorders. I really liked it it was tied for my favorite rotation. I loved the age range of younger adults and talking with patients and counseling them. I LOVED eating disorders. But since I spent my entire time there, I am worried that I did not get a full inpatient psych experience. However, my rotation in the psych ED was strange of course and a bit scary, and I found that psych outpatient also went by a little slower than derm clinic (because I would look at the clock wondering when the appointment time was over). I am also worried about the safety aspect and the same thing about derm as not feeling like a real doc to others (even though I know mental health is important, but also life circumstances determine like 90% of someone's mental wellbeing, so I don't know if I'llalways feel job satisfaction if my patients don't respond to treatments. And I feel sad about losing other clinical knowledge I had and never using my stethoscope. But the lifestyle is wonderful and all my friends had an intervention with me telling me to do psych because they always say that im the easiest person to talk to and always ask the right questions. my psych evals were also wonderful and everyone was saying I was so good at it. I genuinely enjoy talking with others so much, I am a huge extrovert, and I loved my psych rotation. It felt light and easy (not sure if it;s just eating disorders though) and I enjoyed going everyday. But, again I'm not sure if like derm this was just a med-student-friendly rotation. It also seems like the lifestyle and not working crazy hard also suits me.

I would really appreciate any insights or thoughts you all have. Thank you SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME!!!!! and let me know if you think dual applying is the answer.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1jdsp9y/help_picking_a_specialty/

1ftxzed,How to let an undergrad go?,"So I (now newly 3rd year PhD in USA) interviewed this person (now 4th year UnderGrad, just switched majors to stem/my labs focus right before the interview) last winter and chose her to join out of several applicants despite a slightly lower gpa cus she seemed capable and good to work with.

Through the winter quarter, UG was not very reliable to show up, didn’t take notes despite me reminding her, and ended up having to take a few week break from the lab at the end   because of burnout, which I totally understand. She said she’d return for spring, in which I’d be taking my QE, so my amazing lab mate took her under her wing for me. She continued to not be reliable, barely showed up once a week, still no notes, but at least some practical experience was gained. One time they had an agreed to meet and the UG finally texted my lab mate an hour after they were supposed to meet that she couldn’t make it. Almost always, these are emergencies or finals. 

Fast forward to this fall quarter. She had an internship over summer in industry where she learned some techniques, notebooks skills, and hopefully time management. Promising to drop her other lab to commit to ours, she still didn’t show up for our first meeting this week or drop by the lab last week like she said she would. 
So it’s time to let her go… but how??? 
I have no idea how to write this email that I need to send out today. I want to be encouraging and offer to stop by a resource for her but she hasn’t made our lab a priority (as my PI put it). Any advice on how to let her down gently but let her know I’m not gonna keep wasting my time and enable this behavior anymore, is appreciated. 

Update: I sent her a well written  ChatGPT thing but now she’s responded BEGGING for one more chance (tomorrow as planned). I’ve already had the priority talk with her 2 months ago and several attempts last winter to get her to be more timely. So she’s beyond her like 6th strike now… I feel awful for this cus I see myself in her, trying to juggle all the things. But I don’t have time for this, I’m a third year with no data!

Please do not sign up for a career  you are not fully in love with, just to match. I know not matching is  scary, but matching into a speciality you are not meant for can literally be life ending unlike any other field in medicine. Like who's ever heard of a derm fatalaity? I mean, just take a research year or year off and amass more debt. After all, whats a few thousand dollars compared to the 1/2 mil you're already in the whole? It's not like being an out of cycle unmatched applicant next year will have ANY negative impact on your application. Plus we don't need more aloof PCPs that act as referral jockies & prop up midlevels just to make a quick buck. FM  is a special place and requires more empathy, people skills, multitasking, bending over and taking it from admin, insurance, patients, your fellow physicians in more prized specialties (like EM), and cognitive load, than any other. I am biased however as an FM applicant, these are facts (definitely not opinions supported by ""studies"" written by other FM physicians). I can tell you  whole-heartedly, this is not the place to be if you don’t truly want and  crave to be in chaos, constantly.

1bqb608,Broke down in tears in tutorial today,"So… I just had the most embarrassing fucking thing in the world happen to me today. As the title says, I broke down crying in front of my students while leading tutorial. I still can’t believe it. I’m so mortified and disappointed in myself I don’t even have the words for it. But I thought maybe I could reach out to people on here because I’m too embarrassed to admit to pretty much anyone in my real life that this has happened. Warning: pity party incoming. I know I screwed up so please don’t tell me that haha, maybe share a story of when something like this has happened to you??

This semester has absolutely kicked my ass. The professor has a weird way of doing tutorials where the students have a weekly short assignment that they do which is due the Sunday night before the course. Tutorials are organized based off of questions that we (instructor and TA) come up with based on the assignment. The assignments all need to be graded before the tutorials on Thursday, leaving 3 days to mark around 80 assignments and come up with questions based off of them. So on Thursdays I attend the lecture in the morning, then lead four 50-minute tutorials back to back with 10 minutes between each one (all in different rooms lol). 

I have to get up really early for this class as the professor likes me to be there around half an hour before the lecture starts, but I don’t always manage to get to bed as early as I would like the night before (due to having to get my own assignments done, meal prep for Thursday as I don’t have time to buy anything for lunch between tutorials, and sports), so I’m always tired all day and typically am having migraine symptoms by the end of the day due to fatigue which is a trigger for me (I have a migraine disorder and can sometimes ward off the migraine with meds + caffeine if I get to it soon enough but obviously if it happens during tutorials I have no way of accessing caffeine until all 4 are done because I don’t have enough time in between to walk to the nearest cafe). Also, the fourth tutorial is hard because half the class doesn’t show up, so I’ve formulated all these questions and structured the flow of the tutorial around them, and then the people aren’t there to answer them so I have to reformulate on the fly while dealing with a group that is really not participatory at all. 

Anyway, today was especially bad. I was so wiped. My eyes were closing of their own accord and by the time I got to the fourth tutorial, it was like my brain was shutting down. Not only were half the words I said coming out wrong (saying “injury” instead of “industry”, that kind of thing), I couldn’t sustain my attention for more than a few seconds. I have a mediocre attention span at the best of times, but in the fourth tutorial, students were talking and I was trying SO hard to listen and it was like my brain just refused. They would finish talking and I wouldn’t be able to formulate a response because I had barely understood a word they said. Anyway, at one point I asked a student a question based on her assignment and I phrased the question very poorly. She explained that that wasn’t what she meant as she (fairly) thought I had misunderstood her point when actually I had just done a shit job of phrasing the question. I apologized, got ready to move on, and then just… started crying. It was like an out of body experience. I thought “there’s no way this is happening right now”. But it was :( One of the students asked if I was okay and I said yes, apologized profusely, and asked them to please forget that this happened. I wasn’t sobbing or anything, but a few tears definitely leaked out that I had to wipe away and I had to take a few seconds to collect myself and drink some water before I could carry on. 

The positive thing is that the students were really nice about it. Several of them who usually don’t say anything after tutorial took the time to stop, say thank you, and tell me to have a good weekend 🥲 One of the students (the one who asked if I was okay) also checked in with me after. I kept it professional and just briefly said that I was tired and my workload is a bit heavy at the moment, but we had a nice conversation about burnout which I appreciated. 

Anyway, like I said I’m so embarrassed and feel really bad that I was so unprofessional. I’m just trying so hard to be perfect in every area of my life (sports which take up like 20 hours of the week, my relationship which is still fairly new, friendships, TA-ing, RA-ing, etc.) and it really gets to me sometimes. I always feel like I’m dropping the ball somewhere and I don’t get a moment to breathe. My time management has to be absolutely perfect all the time and even then it’s not enough. I have an appt with a counsellor coming up next week so hopefully that’ll help. 

Anyway… thanks for letting me vent 🙃",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1bqb608/broke_down_in_tears_in_tutorial_today/
140w2vy,I'll just say it: research is the hardest part of my job,"It seems like this is totally verboten to admit. 

I find research to be just so, so challenging. I guess I like it? I like the reading, I like finding things out, I even like writing most of the time. But I hate the pressure, the deadlines, the endless revisions, the cruel referees, the endless criticism, and the middle of the night crises when I realize I made a mistake in my code and have to fix all the tables all over again because the numbers are .0001 off. 

Teaching and service seem SO EASY to me compared to these struggles. Every semester I get to hit the reset button. Meanwhile I have research projects that are going on almost ten years before they finally appear in print. Burnout city!

I don't feel secure in tenure, either. Some creep somewhere is going to come out of nowhere to criticize my work, and I won't be able to show my face around my department.

1lt0s3k,Emergency medicine,"Hi everyone,

I’m an M3 currently on my first rotation, emergency medicine, and I’ve been loving it. I genuinely look forward to going in, I love walking into a room, rapidly assessing a patient, and trying to figure out what’s going on. The resuscitations and traumas are incredible, and I’ve even stayed after my shift a few times just because I didn’t want to leave.

I get along well with the residents and attendings, and I enjoy spending time with them. The procedures are awesome, and I’m even thinking about getting ATLS certified early so I can be more involved when trauma cases roll in.

That said, I’ve only been on this rotation for a week and I keep hearing about how tough EM is longterm (the burnout, the lifestyle, the shifts).. It makes me nervous. I’m trying to figure out whether I’m just in the honeymoon phase of my first rotation, or if this might be my specialty. 

Does this sound like EM could genuinely be a good fit for me? Or is it common to feel this energized on your first rotation just because it’s your first? And what helped you figure it out? Thanks in advance!

1loxtzz,Thinking of leaving my Oxford PhD — how do I know I’ve really tried?,"Hi all — I’m 28 and currently doing a PhD at Oxford, UK, in Engineeing. I applied mostly because it was Oxford and in a field related to my previous job — I always wanted to do a PhD and thought it would give me structure, credibility, maybe even pride. But nearly two years in, I’m starting to question whether I’ve truly given this a fair shot, or whether it’s just not right for me.

I completed my first-year modules, but then intermitted for 9 months due to burnout and several family bereavements. During that time, I was also diagnosed as autistic and with ADHD — which explained a lot about why I’d been struggling to stay afloat, masking constantly, and running on fumes.

When I came back, things initially felt better. I had some strategies, more clarity, and genuine motivation. But over the last few months, I’ve felt myself slipping again — back into procrastination, disconnection, and exhaustion. I don’t feel like I’ve gained any skills or momentum. It’s like I’ve just… existed through this, rather than grown.

I’m funded via a standard stipend, but was supposed to receive an uplift from my external sponsor. Despite chasing it over and over, it’s never come through — and after two years, that uncertainty has really worn me down. The admin and comms have been messy and demoralising.

I haven’t made friends here. I’m not sure how well I tried, and I still feel isolated. Most days I work alone, or avoid working altogether because I’m too overwhelmed. And to be honest, I don’t even know if I care about my research topic anymore — but I also don’t know if that’s burnout talking, or if I just chose a project for the institution, not the subject.

I keep asking myself: have I tried hard enough to know this isn’t right for me? Or am I quitting something I haven’t really let myself engage with?
I’m scared that leaving would be a mistake — but I’m also scared that staying would be one too. I don’t want to spend years trying to force myself into an environment I’m not built for.

If you’ve left your PhD (especially after intermission, burnout), did you regret it? What helped you make that call?

——

I don’t know if it’s burnout from the eternal pandemic or if I just got a few particularly bad sections, but it seems like the students this semester are more burnt out, more likely to turn in abysmal work, and less invested than any semester before—not just in the “love of learning” aspects of the courses, but even in the things explicitly explained in the syllabus and in class multiple times. There is a dramatic drop in average quality even just since last Spring. 

I’m trying to balance empathy for students, reflecting on my own practices, and not completely sacrificing standards so as to hamstring students in future classes, but it is frankly exhausting and perplexing that students this semester seem to have given up on even the low-hanging fruit, like signing emails with their names or using spell check included in their word processing programs.

1kamygj,How were my Master's and PhD experiences allowed to happen?,"The question is semi rhetorical, but folks can answer if they want to in this case. I'm (31M) a 5th year PhD student defending their dissertation this Friday. I've had a tumultuous Master's and PhD, as indicated in the list below. Skip the list if you saw the comment with the details:

1.) First PhD advisor dropped me due to a dispute over how I managed the lab. She advised me from 2020 (my first year)-2022.

2.) Program chair thankfully takes me as an advisee. At this point though, my autistic burnout and PTSD (yes, it's clinically diagnosed) were so bad that I could only focus on doing one research project at a time (my first PhD advisor made me only work on one project at a time) and still am only working on only my dissertation. I put in 10-20 hours per week's worth of work this academic year.

3.) My stipend got cut in half my 3rd year due to university budget issues. Same tuition waiver was intact thankfully, so I got the rest of my program paid off at that point.

4.) I never worked on multiple projects throughout my Master's or PhD at all. I was also the only one who stuck with a 10 hour graduate research assistantship both years of my Master's (everyone else other than me took on something extra to get to 20 hours a week), was one of two who didn't TA at all. I didn't since I was a.) scared of bombing the 1 credit hour course that was required for me to take in order to teach and b.) I thought it was self evident that the course would teach students how to full blown teach a course rather than just TA. Only one person ended up teaching altogether and everyone else TAed.

5.) Ended up with a C+ in a core course (which was still passing) in my Master's program and ended up with a 3.48 GPA in my case.

6.) I graduated my Master's with huge debt since it was the only program that appealed to my interests ($52k from both undergrad and Master's). I also didn't know that I could rescind my acceptance before the April 15th deadline. Had I known that I could do so, I would've accepted one of two fully funded assistantship offers I got on April 14th and 15th respectively that weren't Experimental Psychology programs (the field I'm in. One was General Psychology and the other was Cognitive and Social Processes).

7.) I never collaborated throughout graduate school and was basically isolated from every other department and professor in my case. Fast forward to now and I have no connections really other than my old internship boss from last summer who occasionally sends out messages to the ""2024 cohort"" of interns. My job applications are all as cold as cold can get.

8.) I edited this point in, but I bombed at both adjunct teaching and as a visiting full time instructor despite the suggestion that academia was the route for me (spoiler alert: it's not). This is not hyperbole either and my ratings were that bad. I had ratings in the mid to high 2s out of 5 and 1.4-1.8s on my last semester teaching (a downwards trend in other words). I even went as far as referring a renewable full time lecturer offer that would've been in effect this year had I taken it. I genuinely grew to hate teaching so living off my savings this year was a price I was willing to pay.

I realize that some of my program experiences were my responsibility. However, when the damage was done and it became obvious to my peers (e.g., my Master's program, one of then asked, ""Do you have an assistantship with your advisor?"" I replied, ""Yes."" Their reply, ""Well, at least you have that."") and faculty (the director told me to have a Plan B when I was still interested in PhD programs. After I switched to my current PhD advisor, he also told me that my CV is a ""bit lacking"" as well), that was only when I was pulled aside and questioned at all. Why didn't any of this happen sooner though? It took me actually being behind my peers for anyone to pay attention at all. I'm also first gen, even at the undergrad level, so it's not like any of this is obvious at all.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1kamygj/how_were_my_masters_and_phd_experiences_allowed/
1eeiovw,I'm beginning to hate it here - is this normal?,"Depression, disdain, anger, whatever you want to call it (and maybe a bit of all of that), things are setting in which really make me wonder why the hell I'm even here. For reference, I work in the ecology field at a R2 university, though our Ag college and my department like to tout we are a R1 program housed within a R2 university. I have a 75%/25% research/teaching appointment and am going up for my 4 year continuation review at the end of September.

  
I look around at what I've done over the past 4 years and get incredibly frustrated by the tenure process and the faculty that are basically ""in charge"" of my livelihood through the voting process. Yes, I get it, it's what I signed up for; so maybe it's my own fault? My third year saw what I would consider my most productive year: 7 publications, $1.5 million in grant money, graduated my first graduate student, all glowing reviews on my teaching evals. I won a College-level junior research award. And yet, I received my worst annual evaluation since I have been here. The one metric that is hurting me (and continues to hurt me) is graduating students...I need to graduate four students minimum to qualify for tenure. I've gotten one through, another failed to finish and left, one switched from a MS to a PhD (dumb move on my part I guess because even though it was good for the student, it hurt my in my tenure eval) and in the meantime I have a measly 11 graduate students (5 MS, 6PhD). In a perfect world, I would finish 4 students before I submit my packet, but who knows? Students are students, and it's up to them to finish; I can't force them, only guide them. 

  
As a whole, I've pulled >$4.5 million in grant dollars, I just hit 20 pubs during my probation period (including 5 first authors and two that were lead by my students). And still, that annual evaluation is really taking the wind out of my sails. I know there are some senior faculty that outright just don't like me. It's clear that plays a role here, and perhaps I should have done politics a bit better when I first arrived (lesson learned). But after all of this, I feel empty, beat down, and wondering what the hell I'm even doing other than collecting the paycheck so that I can maintain my quality of life. Is this normal?

1ho8z5x,Diagnosed with a disability during the PhD... any other autistics doing a PhD? ,"The first year of this PhD I floundered. 

I felt despair that entire first year and I was a complete mess after going through rotations and not being able to keep a consistent schedule. It was an extreme burnout (autistic burnout for those familiar with the term) from life and an extreme depression that got me diagnosed in the first place this late in life (bruh). I literally went through a cognitive decline. I could not hold a consistent string of thoughts that entire first year. Now, I can finally hold onto a thought for up to four hours and keep building on it. 

Because of this cognitive decline I went through, my advisor thinks I'm a fucking idiot, which I literally was during that time. I took a class with him and I was constantly asking for extensions, which he granted to me and I am extremely thankful. This is just evidence to say how mentally fucked I was during that time. 

I don't know what to say. I hate the unstructured nature of the program, this really gets to me everyday. I don't understand when I should show up to lab or when I should execute tasks. I also have no deadlines or anything. Everyday I come into the lab lost and confused. I don't care about my subject anymore, all this research seems incredibly useless - I don't know if I'll ever get over the feeling of the useless nature of this PhD. 

On top of all of that, I am trying my best to avoid being overstimulated in the work place. For those who don't know, autistic brains operate in a bottom-up processing mode, while ""normal"" or ""neurotypical"" brain types operate in a top-down processing mode. Due to the bottom-up processing autistic individuals go through, it is easy for them to get overwhelmed with their environment and all its details - making them more likely to be detail oriented, but prone to getting overwhelmed or overstimulated. 

I get overstimulated by the noises of the instruments in lab (I have good noise canceling headphones, but it's not enough for me, I still hear every noise and my autistic brain will never tune them out) and the random discussions that pop-up left and right that I get involved in terrorize me. 

It's just the constantly changing environment makes my head want to explode. There is no space for me to isolate and collect my thoughts together (or stim for those who know). The lab desks are an open office concept to promote collaboration (bro what collaboration, it's every man for his/herself in research). I cannot even just sit at my desk and decompress because everyone else is around me and can see me. 

Even when pipetting and mixing solutions at my lab bench, I get overstimulated easily. Especially when someone comes and stands next to me to pipette as well. My brain just looses all function because I am overwhelmed by the presence of someone else next to me. What makes it worse is that we have to share pipettors and communicate with each other (some really bullshit thing because my PI wants to save $$$??? this never made sense to me). This causes me to get overwhelmed even more. 

It's insane. I spend my days getting overstimulated by my environment - an extremely painful experience that doesn't allow me to focus on my work. 

All my attempts at mitigating overstimulation during the work day are futile. To cope with overstimulation, I need to be completely isolated to reorient myself, but there exists no isolated safe space for me to rid of this overstimulation. (I guess I'm a true scientist who loves being isolated with their work lmao). 

So then, I end up coming home and melting down for 3+ hours on the daily because I have held on to this pain for so long that it all comes out all at once. (The only reason why autism is viewed as a ""disability"" is because they cannot function in ""normal"" everyday environments... change the environment and watch the ""disability"" part go away lmaoooo).  

I have told my advisor about my diagnosis and the ***daily*** *struggles* I go through, but there are no accommodations that can be offered, and I completely get that. Either you can do the PhD or not, that's it. 



If this career is killing me this much mentally just because of the environment that I'm in, then it is not worth it for me. I don't give a shit anymore about my program, just like it doesn't give a shit about me. 

  
All of this is really making me think to just master the fuck out and get a remote job as a medical writer (I feel like I am a strong writer overall) so I don't have to interface with anyone. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ho8z5x/diagnosed_with_a_disability_during_the_phd_any/
1kx0rop,Does a PhD ever end? I’m exhausted,"I’m going into my sixth year of my PhD, and honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can keep going.

My advisors just keep piling on more and more tasks, even though I’m no longer getting paid for the PhD and it’s no longer my full-time focus. I’m completely burned out trying to juggle research with my current job. For the past six months, I’ve been stuck trying to get a single experiment to work, and nothing moves forward. To make it worse, now the lab has run out of funding and my supervisor still tries to push things forward even without the bare minimum. Last week we didn’t even have fetal bovine serum, so I couldn’t continue my cell cultures and lost (once again) at least a month of work.

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of restarting experiments over and over again. I’m tired of giving up my weekends. I have some results. I don’t even know if they’re “enough,” or if they’re what my supervisors were expecting. But they’re what I have and honestly, I don’t believe in the project anymore.

I started my PhD at the beginning of the pandemic. I worked with human patient samples, so it was horrible to do anything during covid. I lost my brother in my first year of PhD and just swallowed my grief to keep going. I’ve kept pushing and sacrificing through everything and now honestly I just want this chapter of my life to be over.

1l88guc,First-Year PhD Student Struggling to Find Direction,"Hey everyone,

This is my first time posting here, so please excuse any formatting or grammar issues.

I’m a first-year PhD student (23 y/o) and recently passed my qualifying exams. I’ve been exploring my research direction for the past 2–4 months. It does slightly deviate from my master’s work, I’ve been reading a lot of papers, Having discussion with my advisor, and working on different projects and also  to trying to narrow things down in my research.

But honestly… I feel like I’m spinning in circles.

Some days I feel like I have ideas but no proof for results to support them. Other days, i am struck. The field feels *so vast*, and I’m struggling to identify what’s novel And if i am being honest its like i am reading ,reading and reading....but the output is nothing. I really want to write my first paper and contribute something meaningful — but I’m panicking a bit because I just don’t know how to move forward.

My advisor is a good person — very supportive and laid back, and he gives solid ideas when we talk. But there are moments when I feel like he’s not totally sure what I’m doing… or ...that I’m not doing anything good enough(not with the research but my effort maybe). And sometimes, it feels like he’s way out of my league, and I’ll never be able to reach his level. It’s intimidating. 

In this loop- with just few months into it ..i am feeling burnout slightly....i love what i am doing....i know i am kinda being clueless is the reason i am feeling this way   

Sorry for the rant. I’m just overwhelmed and unsure of where to go next. If anyone has advice, I’d really appreciate it. Here are a few specific questions:

1. How to learn ""to learn""?

2How do you approach a research problem? Is it just about reading papers? Are there structured methods or frameworks that helped you?

3. How do you plan your research or stay organized? Any tools or software you recommend? 

4. Also any tools for research papers? I've tried Connected Papers and SciSpace, but I still feel lost sometimes.

I don’t have many people around to ask these questions, so I’m turning here. Any guidance, even small tips, would mean a lot.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1l88guc/firstyear_phd_student_struggling_to_find_direction/
17l3smf,I miss being in love with school,"Hi all,

I miss being in love with school and it is stressing! me! out! I am doing the bare, and i mean BARE minimum. I have classes 3x a week (3 classes, one class per day, each being 3 hours) and I barely read the material anymore or do the outside readings because it isn't tested or really required or demanded of us. In undergrad though, I was at the library 25/7 because I was so in love with studying and learning (granted I was doing STEM things) but now I feel like working a full-time job and being a full-time student (even though I'm barely doing it), I am not really feeling like I am doing all that I can or that I can find it in me to care and it's stressing me out that I may potentially be in the wrong field.

I have loved school for the past 4 years. I can't tell if it's from the burnout from working fulltime or if it's because I've lost motivation or if it's the degree itself that's not made for me. Idk.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/17l3smf/i_miss_being_in_love_with_school/
1matdvi,Working full time & in school,"Hi you all, I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or validation, so I'll take anything. I'm 26 YO, in the process of getting my second degree: my parents refused to help me with FAFSA paperwork unless I did what they wanted me to do the first time around. Now that I'm an independent student, I'm going back to pursue science.

I'm only about 60% of the way done with this degree after 3 years (including prereqs that I didn't have to take due to my first degree). Mostly due to me taking semesters off because I'm so tired from working my 40+ hours a week 8-5 job. I've failed classes because I've chosen sleep or having a day off over studying. Untreated ADHD and depression also aren't helping matters. I've decided to try to switch to an online program to see if that'll fix the burnout/pure exhaustion from school and work. 

  
My dilemma is this: I'm genuinely over working and going to school. I've dropped to part-time, and that's helped with the burnout a lot, but I really want to give up on this. I just know I'll regret it if I do. I do NEED at least a Master's to get into my dream field. My current full-time job is not at all what I want, but it is a ""career"". People are so happy with this job and company that they choose to stay until retirement.

 I guess what I'm asking is if you all think it's worth it to push through, no matter how long it takes. That's what I want to do, but I already feel silly for taking as long as I have. It's discouraging and very embarrassing for someone who graduated Magna Cum Laude in three years with her first Bachelor's.

Hey fellow engineering students,

I'm about to enter what's probably the most brutal semester of my CS degree, and I need your wisdom. My upcoming semester includes:

Theory of Automata (TOA)

Operating Systems (OS) + Lab

Database Systems (DB) + Lab

Computer Networks (CN) + Lab

Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Total: 18 credit hours


No minors, no fluff, just straight-up mind-breaking core subjects 😭

I know these courses are heavy on concepts, logic, and practicals. I'm aiming to get A grades in all of them, or at least minimize GPA damage. So here’s what I want to ask:


---

❓ Questions:

How did you manage your time across theory + 3 labs?

Any tips to study smart, not just hard?

What helped you crack TOA proofs or understand Algorithms better?

Best resources (YouTube, PDFs, websites) for each course?

What mistakes should I absolutely avoid?

How did you avoid burnout in a heavy semester like this?

143ebwq,Perspectives and advice from a graduating resident,"As graduation looms and we all move in lockstep to the next stages in our careers, I thought I would provide some perspective as I have been on this subreddit since I started medical school and seen just how much frustration and anguish this path can bring. To the incoming new MS1s - yes it will suck. To the incoming students starting clinical rotations - yes it will suck. And to the incoming interns, yes it will suck.

&nbsp;

But overall? Medical school and residency have been the most rewarding time for personal and professional growth. Sure there were shitty, sleepless, stressful nights where I binged Sketchy trying to cobble a passing grade but I also got to grow alongside the most talented, kind, and hardworking individuals who I may never have met otherwise. My close friends treat cancer, deliver babies, ease the passing of dying patients. The war stories we trade at weddings and graduations are incomprehensible to the average person. We as physicians need to do better in leveraging our collective voice because the community is there - I love all my colleagues and would never want to work with a different group of people.

&nbsp;

I don't feel like I missed out on anything at all - my friends in medical school have gotten married, bought houses, had children, and built their lives from the ground up. They made sacrifices with their time and energy and as a community we do need to prioritize wellness better, especially for starting families. Yes, the tech bro in SF has a nicer apartment - but how can you come home after seeing undocumented patients struggling to cobble together $5 for bus fare then complain about not owning a beautiful home in the suburbs yet? If you ever feel like you got the short end of the stick (maybe you have to take an extra day of call compared to a colleague) just look at the patient in front of you. 9 times out of 10 you would not trade your life for a single day in theirs, and I hope that provides you with some perspective moving forward.

&nbsp;

Coming from a heavily recruited top undergrad, I feel zero insecurity comparing the arc of my career to those who pursued other high income professions. Trust me, the people who question whether they should've done tech are the same ones who go into tech and wonder if they should've gone into medicine or business or law. Take a bunch of neurotic high-achievers and I promise you there will be second-guessers. Be confident and happy in your choice, and know there are avenues downstream to expand your career into other fields. Be proud but not arrogant, and remember that you did not accomplish this by yourself.

&nbsp;

For residency, I recommend prioritizing wellness, happiness, and fit above all else. I chose the program that felt like home. I had some of the most brutal call nights working 48+ hours, patching together the most disastrous eyes while explaining to families that their child would never see again, then showing up to a full day of clinic before passing out for 24 straight hours. It was soul-crushing and I wanted to quit, but it also pushed my limits and taught me that I can do anything I want. Those long nights holding patients' hands are the stories that go into your personal *House of God* that you write every day with your life's work. Those nights are the reason why when I feel overwhelmed, I can tell myself ""Everything will be okay"" and believe it. It's normal to feel stretched thin, but make sure you tell someone. Tell your program director or chief that you need to sleep in. Or just tell a co-resident or empathetic senior. I've sent junior residents home many, many times to catch up on sleep/notes, and that's ok. It's a marathon not a sprint, and we all need help getting to the finish line.

&nbsp; 

And before I make it sound like I had a toxic residency, I should say that I received the best, most supportive training I could've asked for. Don't pick a higher ranked program over one where you'll be happy. In our department of 20+ attendings, we have zero toxic personalities (ok there's one guy who can be snippy but he's also the one who you can call 24/7/365 and will bail you out of any emergency because that's how much he cares about residents). My program director feels like a member of my family. I probably shouldn't even say this but as a senior I had entire weeks working <20 hours. I do zero scutwork - most weeks I was either performing surgery, working in clinics where that I felt were most beneficial to my own education, or seeing my own post-ops. I had all weekends and holidays off unless I'm on call, which we split between our whole class. These programs are less rare than you think (well, outside of surg), you just have to search for them. My family medicine friends don't rush to tell Reddit ""My attending cancelled his clinic today so I'm going home!"" because he's too busy playing 14 straight hours of Diablo 4 (yeah buddy I see you online). Make sure you ask the residents lots of questions on interview day about fit, culture, and training. Speaking to previous graduates may even be more valuable because they'll provide a candid, discrete opinion that should figure heavily into your decision process.

&nbsp;

This is probably the most important piece of advice I will give you: do not, under ANY circumstance, develop a reputation for laziness or unreliability. Pick a healthy residency and work hard, and they will treat you well. If I don't show up for clinic because a junior resident needs me to help them with an emergency, NO ONE will check where I am. I could probably not show up to a single clinic until graduation and my attendings will just assume I'm working with someone else that day. This is because when an attending or resident or program director needs help and I'm able to fill in that gap, my default answer is always yes. If I didn't check an exam finding or review the imaging results myself, I don't lie and say that I did. This is not true for everyone in my department. We have people who have been dishonest in the past or gone missing from clinic one too many times, and they are still being watched like hawks. Your reputation precedes you. I would argue that your reputation is the most important thing to build your career on, whether it be for jobs or fellowships so make sure you protect it. And yes, do try to read a bit when you can to build your fund of knowledge.

&nbsp;

As far as the light at the end of the tunnel goes, I am now interviewing for positions with unbelievable compensation, unbeatable job security, and amazing lifestyle. Again, this is more common than you think. The average attending is VERY happy, they're just too busy golfing to answer surveys about burnout. Human nature is to complain so whenever we congregate we just bitch about how much our lives suck. But the reality is that most patients are endlessly grateful for your work. Remember that patients come to doctors, anxious and fearful, because they want to feel better - it's not necessarily to receive a new medication or undergo a surgery. The human compassion of handholding and counseling is simultaneously the most valuable but least prioritized aspect of what we do every day. This work is intellectually fascinating, rapidly evolving, and will change multiple times throughout our careers.

&nbsp;

So to everyone about to turn over a new leaf, congratulations! Medicine is one big community and we will watch your career with great interest. I would pick this life again every single day of the week. And when you're a 95-year-old GOMER lying in your lakeside villa surrounded by your loving family and the relics of a fulfilling career, I promise your last words won't be ""*I should've gone into business...*""",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/143ebwq/perspectives_and_advice_from_a_graduating_resident/
1mlg1ha,feel like I’ve reached my limit — advice from other PhD students,"Hi everyone,

I’m a PhD student and I feel like I’ve been running on empty for too long. I don’t really know where else to share this, but I’m hoping other grad students might understand what I’m going through and maybe offer some perspective or advice.

Back in Fall 2024, I had a serious issue with my supervisor that made it impossible for me to continue working under them. It was a difficult and stressful situation, and I ultimately had to take a leave of absence for that term. In Winter 2025, I started again with a new supervisor. I was determined to make this work and not let the past define my progress.

Unfortunately, my restart coincided with a personal crisis that I’ve been dealing with since January (I’ve shared a detailed account elsewhere, but in short, it’s been one of the most traumatic experiences of my life). It’s affected me deeply, both emotionally and mentally. I didn’t want to jeopardize my new supervision or come across as a student with “constant issues,” so I kept pushing through, hiding how bad things really were.

Somehow, I managed to make progress, pass my comprehensive exams, and prove — to myself and others — that I deserve to be in this program. But the truth is, my mental health hasn’t improved. In fact, it’s been getting worse. I was just diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder last week.

And now, there’s another blow: the funding situation for the upcoming year is completely different from what I was led to believe. My understanding from earlier conversations was that my living stipend would be maintained at the same level as when I started, and that I would TA to match that amount going forward. I didn’t realize that I would also have to pay tuition out of my stipend, which drastically reduces the amount I have to live on for the year.

I’m exhausted. A PhD is already hard enough under normal circumstances, but with my mental health where it is, my personal life in pieces, and now this financial stress, it just feels impossible. I’m genuinely thinking about quitting altogether. The only reason I’ve kept going so far is because I didn’t want to disappoint my dad, but right now even staying alive feels like a battle I can’t keep fighting.

I’m also considering “mastering out” just to have something to show for the years I’ve already put in — but I don’t know if that’s the right call or just a decision made in burnout and despair.

If you’ve been through something similar — balancing major personal hardship, mental health struggles, and the pressures of a PhD — I’d really appreciate hearing how you navigated it. Did you take a break? Switch paths? Push through? How did you know when it was time to step away?

Thanks for reading this far. I feel like I’m drowning and just needed to say it out loud to people who might understand.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mlg1ha/feel_like_ive_reached_my_limit_advice_from_other/
1ja1umk,Dealing with impatient parents?,"I'm (30M) in my 5th year and should be graduating in May if all goes according to plan here.

I'm posting now because I just had an argument with my parents over what I'm doing right now as I wrap up my PhD. My father seems to be convinced I could've worked an outside job again this entire time. My funding ran out two years ago and am taking one extension credit hour per academic year. Oddly enough, I don't disagree and I could've done something part time if I wanted to truly. But not full time like he probably thinks in this case. At the same time, I didn't want to work and cause potential tension between me and my current advisor. I also admit I could've put more effort into a fellowship project that I didn't work on until a few days before I gave a talk and need to give a poster on for a conference this May. However, even working on that more wouldn't have changed the fact that I'm living off of savings (around $7500 once a reimbursement is processed in this case) and that frustrates my father in particular. My parents also want me to schedule a defense date soon, even though that's up to my advisor and not me.

I've been applying to two jobs a week with the assistance of vocational rehabilitation (I have multiple disabilities, including ASD level 1) while mainly balancing my dissertation and not working on side projects other than the literature review for my fellowship occasionally. Main reason isn't exactly a good excuse, but I've realized now that I've let my emotions take over what I'm doing in real time and I'll nap a lot. I'm also dealing with autistic burnout as well, which my father thinks is a cop out and am excuse for folks talking about it (he didn't target me specifically). He also has fairly ableist views, such as me being one of the only autistic adults who ""doesn't drag people down."" I'd try to convince him, but he's not open to learning and I've accepted that much.

Funnily enough though, they were OK with me declining a full time renewable instructor position that would've taken effect this academic year had I accepted it. So, where's the line? I'm not sure and I want to talk to them about it soon. My parents also want me to take a job near home (I'm living at home with them since I don't need to be on campus for mg PhD anymore) as well and don't want me to take any jobs out of state too.

So, how can I deal with my parents' impatience regarding me scheduling a dissertation defense date? How can I also deal with taking a job in my area of the US (Midwest) even if it's not in my home state?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ja1umk/dealing_with_impatient_parents/
1m5kp1e,Immense writer's block. Feeling like a failure. Trying to get over it.,"Hey all. Just venting to try and get out my frustrations and back to being productive.

Long story short, in my program we can finish the written thesis after the oral defense. I got a good portion of my writing done (2.3/3 data chapters) before my oral defense. The preparation was hell for me, but the actual defense day went well, even if I didn't manage to say everything I wanted. That was a month and a half ago. Now, I'm supposed to finish writing and submit my first draft to my committee and I just. can't. write. I have the last data chapter, an intro, and conclusions left to go, and 5 days left before the deadline I gave myself and my committee.

The past month, every time I tried to get started again, I would remember the terrible months leading up to my defense and become crazy anxious, to the point of feeling nauseous. I struggle with OCD and perfectionism(i'm sure many academics can relate to the latter) but it's never gotten this bad before. I look at my thesis and can't help but feel the writing is bad. Beyond the writing, there are so many gaps and unfinished threads in my work...I feel like my long (7+ year) PhD was just a waste. Now, the physical nausea has gone away but I still have writer's block. I feel so weak for not being able to get out of my own head.

There's probably a lot of contributing factors. Burnout, anxiety over lack of job opportunities at the moment (i'm US based), sadness over leaving my lab, etc. I'm just trying to tell myself 'a good thesis is a done thesis' and that I'll pull it off in the end.

Hows it going for you and your non-medical student significant others?

(MS3 in Arizona here) It’s been progressing over the past two years. I can’t say it’s been all bad, there’s plenty of amazing times but maybe because I learned. How to avoid triggering my wife? I do my best to make time and I study from home when I know she’s home. I try to make small trips and go out for dinner here and there. Even after 15+ hour days I come home tired but never moody. She works too but for her it’s like all hands in deck and if she works too long she gets super moody and takes her anger out on anything I do wrong that normally isn’t a problem. I tell her many times to take care of her sleep and eat and take breaks just so I can avoid the fallout when she’s at that end of the week burnout BS. 

Besides that idk if it’s my profession but she gets super insecure and it becomes toxic to the relationship. Sometimes I avoid collaborating with any women with research or presentations just to avoid a problem. And if she gets mad about anything, she always wants to leave for the day or give me the silent treatment and that really hurts my mental peace because I spend my days at the hospital if she doesn’t block me trying to reason with her. 

I don’t know what to do anymore and what’s been creeping in my mind is a divorce because I don’t want to be with someone who if feel sometimes I have to walk on egg-shells around and so such a flight risk it makes me insecure about the future and to be frank, I rather divorce now with no children and in student debt than if it’s expected later. Been together for 7 years. Please any advice would mean the world to me because I honestly have nobody to talk to about this. Nobody would understand better than a medical student who’s also married.

I sacrificed romance, debauchery and sadly, my body for academic achievement my entire life, and now that almost all of my friends and acquaintances are either working or studying in another country, I feel like I've wasted everything. I was too scared to apply to another country for a PhD because I'm very close to my parents, and being away from them just felt wrong when I realised they were getting older. But I'm so stagnant. I'm in my hometown, but mostly at home, because what's the point in exploring the place I've always lived in with my 2 school friends who are still in the city?

I have my various hobbies (if playing Hitman WoA and reading count as hobbies) but my brain keeps postponing things, saying ""you'll do this or that during your postdoc, etc"". It's always AFTER the next thing. I'll get healthy/exercise/live-in-the-moment/find love/experience things AFTER I achieve x/y/z. It's never now.

I AM that loser who peaked in school; who never grew up and now my brain is rotting (I don't even know how to use a semicolon correctly anymore). I'm losing myself to overconsumption because that's all I do now. I do the science in the lab or on the computer and then I feed my brain with movies and shows and books and dreams to escape my mundane reality. I feel like I haven't existed as a person for years. I'm alive and breathing but my mind is lost to the ether.

I just need to know if anyone out there has felt the same as me, and if it ever changed for you. How do I prevent myself from being a sad loser virgin all my life? I know I'm super interesting and fun deep inside but it's buried under a fat layer of ennui. Help pls.

Therefore, the only real commitment I have right now is school and I am only taking 12 hours. So far, other than the day I used to set up my desk and home office, I’ve worked on school every day. I am terrified of getting behind. Talking to a friend who is in undergrad, I learned that she takes off every Sunday from work and school work. Even though I don’t have a job, I am thinking of designating one day to self-care, relaxing, and no school. 

Does anyone else do this without getting behind? What are some other things you do for school/life balance to prevent burnout? ",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1impxgg/what_is_your_weekly_schedule/
qhsrc3,I'm not OK.,"I keep receiving emails that say ""I hope this finds you well..."", or I find my self answering ""I'm good"" when asked how I'm doing by colleagues. But the fact is that I'm not OK. I made an international move during the pandemic with my family, and it was hard as heck. I'm still not settled a year later and still not OK.

I was not prepared to feel a loss or grief  from moving on from my past adjunct position.

I was not prepared to handle the emotional weight and struggles that our students are facing.

I was not prepared to raise young children during a pandemic in an unfamiliar school system.

I was unprepared to hear so many stories of injustices from students and in the world around us.

I was unprepared to have so many adjuncts facing burnout to the point where I have carried their workload in courses that we share.

I was unprepared to have my anxiety disorder spiral out of control. I've counted at least 14 panic attacks this year alone.

I was unprepared for all of the weight that I've gained during the pandemic and for a ""caring"" faculty member to constantly leave brochures for healthy eating on my desk. (BTW I'm on not skinny but still less under 160 lbs).

So that's my rant. I'm in therapy, I talk to my family about it. But I'm not OK. I thought that I'd share just in case anyone else also isn't ok.

Not looking for advice. Just sharing my grief, and feelings about not being ok. Let's not normalize burnout but instead normalize that many of us are not ""ok"" but still teaching high level courses, researching and raising families.

1m5i6aq,Taking boards after clinical year,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a tough spot and could really use some perspective or advice.

I’m planning to take Step 1after already taking Step 2 and honestly, I’m extremely burnt out at this point. My rotations start next week, and I feel like I’m running on fumes trying to wrap up dedicated before that begins.

Here’s where I stand:

* Just took the AMBOSS self-assessment and scored a 94% chance of passing with an estimated 200.
* But on the NBMEs, I haven’t cracked above 50% on any of them.
* After reviewing, it’s clear most of my mistakes are due to rushing, misreading, or second-guessing — not true content gaps.
* UWorld is \~90% complete, but I’m struggling to keep up with everything. The burnout is making it even harder to focus or retain information.

I’m stuck trying to figure out my next move:

* Should I postpone Step and take after 3rd year?
* Try to study during rotations and aim to test in a few weeks?

If anyone’s been in a similar situation, especially dealing with burnout this close to test day, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

People around me are ecstatic, but I feel absolutely nothing and I am wondering if anyone else got through these feelings.

11ycunt,Current grad student's: Share your stipend/budget or tips to save money/ tips in general for new students. Anything you think a new student needs to know.,"(If you disagree with any of these, just leave a comment and don't downvote. I hate when people do that. I'd much rather be told ""hey this isn't a good tip"", then a downvote that doesn't address the issue. One thing I hate about reddit.)

There's a lot of people getting accepted and thought it would help them realize what grad school is like financially. Also, I'm just curious. (Keep in mind, it might change by your major)

University of Toledo

Stipend: $23k/year

Retirement plan: Yes

Rent: 1Bedroom Apartment $700/month

Electric: (Electric heating) $60-$140/month. Also, electricity can be a scam here in toledo. I had a person knock on my door saying they worked for the electric company (they said the name of the company and dressed like they did) and they needed to correct something on my bill. Long story short, I was stupid/busy, they transfered my account to their company, and after they left I realized my rates would have tripled and luckily I was able to fix it before the damage was done. A week later another guy came and I almost wanted to call the cops on him. Another thing, I got a letter saying that back in November 2000 some committee voted on something and my supplier was going to switch to a different company. My current rate is like 0.02 cents/kilowatt or something and that letter said it was going to go to $0.06/kilowatt. Pretty much my bill would have doubled because a committee voted for something when I was 2 years old. Just, check your email and if something feels off, it probably is.

Internet: (AT&T 25mbps) $4/month because of ACP benefit (Thanks Biden)

General Fees/University Fees: about $700/semester; don't know what summer is yet; parking permit for year $250; my parent's job provide me healthcare but [here's the link](https://www.utoledo.edu/depts/hr/benefits/student/)

Textbooks: ..... learn how to use the internet lol. Books are expensive. If you have to buy, rent or buy used. I found out a lot of people buy books from small bookstore websites, then sell them for a higher price on amazon. So, try and find small bookstore websites.

Renter's Insurance: Around $160/year (liberty mutual)

Credit Card: Discover. I need to get a visa because not everybody accepts Discover (ex: Costco). But there is no annual fee, I've made money off it because of cashback, and they have a ""good grades"" thing that got me $20 a year. I did that during my undergrad and I don't know if it applies for grad students, but I don't think they even check. I think I just needed a student email.

Furniture for new apartment: Cheapest route is probably thrifting stores, Facebook marketplace, or maybe even putting a flyer up at local churches. However, I lived with my parents before grad school so I just saved all my money and bought furniture off amazon. It's not ""expensive"", but it does add up quick. Definitly a few $1,000 went into that. Bought my TV from best buy open box. Oh, and this one is really ghetto, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. If you drive around dumpsters in apartment complexes or just low-income places you can find stuff. My apartment complex is constantly through out furniture. At first I was tempted to take it, fix it up, and sell it, but I didn't have time and I hate Facebook market place.

Tip: Spend a good week looking for programs/local groups that support low-income families. Government programs. Some people shame people who go on welfare and stuff like that, but guess what, you are low-income and definitely qualify. I pay taxes like everyone else and you probably do it. So yeah, abuse it. Get money back.

Food: Honesty, I am still debating if it's better to eat out everyday (places like chipotle; not McDonalds or else you'll feel sick. Speaking from experience). When I consider the time it takes to do dishes and cook food, the price I paid for groceries, time to grocery shop and make a list, I almost think going out and getting dinner every other day saves me money and time. But that's an individual thing everyone needs to think about for themself.

Lighting: My apartment as two windows and no interior lighting except the kitchen and bathroom. The light switch only controls one outlet per room. So I had to get Wi-Fi led lights. I highly recommend [these](https://www.walmart.com/ip/WiZ-LED-Smart-Wi-Fi-Connected-60-Watt-A19-Color-Tunable-White-Light-Bulb-Dimmable-4-Pack/687078291) (although it looks like the price went up. They were $20). The connection is good. Works simi-well with alexia. The biggest thing I like is it has a ""wake-up"" setting that makes me peacefully wake up everyday. I used to tell myself I am not a morning person, but these lights changed that. Also, since there are no windows I lose track of time a lot. These lights have a daylight cycle that change throughout the day.

WATCH OUT FOR BURNOUT! Get a hobby, go for a walk around a metro park, or something. Too many people burn themselves out and I was one of them. Doing classes online during Covid years ago still did a number on me. Pace yourself.

Therapy: If you are even questioning if you need it before grad school you will most likely need it during it. I don't know how expensive it is here.

I don't recommend studying at home. My issue is I really want to go home after class and tell myself I'll study at home, but I never do. Keep school stuff at school. Keep lab stuff in the lab. Your apartment should be a safe place. My only exception is writing stuff because I have a big monitor and hate my laptop.

I know some people in academia are jerks, but I say be honest with your PIs and instructors. Tell them your issues, questions, etc. I mean, don't come up to them with 1,000 of questions and get made they can't help you right there and then. Set an appointment and tell them what your questions are. If it can be done over email, do it. I only had one professor ne a jerk when I had a question, but that was about how an assignment was graded and she gets a pass because she has a relevant health issue.

Lastly, if you were a straight A student through out college, you are probably in for a rough time. Not saying it's impossible, but some people in my program are not coping well with the idea they got a B on an exam. As far as I am aware, grades don't matter after grad school and they are more focused on what type of research you did. I am speaking mainly to PhD students and don't know about master students for this.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/11ycunt/current_grad_students_share_your_stipendbudget_or/
1m4yfi0,[IMP ADVICE] How to avoid burnout while interview prep?,"I was completely burned out 7 months back. To get back on track I had to rest for 1 month completely. I stopped studying completely and watched movies and walked my dog. It helped.

Looking back, it seems there were 3 reasons for my burnout:

* Pressure from daily interviews from full-loop rounds
* Constant rejections
* Long practice hours was the reason.

I addressed all 3.

I used to spend over 6 hours daily on Leetcode. In the last 6 months, I moved to a lighter practice routine and it worked. I did not crack FAANG+ yet but have **accepted a TC $165K job at the largest investment bank**.

I used to spend only 45 minutes daily for preparation, slept for 7 hours at least and went on a walk with my dog daily. I stopped stressing out on getting a job.

I made a weak plan B (MSc) which helped me cope with rejections better. For interviews, I strictly decided to schedule **interviews only on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday**.

This was my lighter prep routine (45 minutes daily, 6 days in a loop):

* **1 day**: 1 LC problem from GRIND sheet. LC discussion/solutions is a goldmine, remember.
* **2 days**: Revising **DSA Takeover Cheatsheet** for coding patterns. **It is not about practice. It is about knowing a lot of patterns and applying the correct one or one by one**.
* **1 day**: System Design YT videos
* **1 day**: Behavior practice. Practiced 6 stories.
* **1 day**: **Mock interview** with a friend

This is mainly for US. As far as I understand, the bar of interview questions and competition is higher in India for FAANG+.

1b5cenv,Self-academic trust is completely broken,"I am a PhD student in cancer biology at my 5th and final year, and hopefully will submit my thesis in a few months. For the first 4 years, I had basically nothing working for me for the first 4 years and since last year, I have found a story that I can chase. During these 5 years, my supervisor has been completely absent and never given any constructive or directive feedback. She didn't want to see any negative results, any optimization process, any mistakes; only cold hard positive data. If there were conflicting results that didn't fit the story, she would tell not to show them to her because it was confusing her. There was no room to discuss any inconsistencies or question marks about your project. From the very start, I was given a few cell types and told to make a project out of them.

Fast forward to the 4th-5th year, I have a semi-convincing story that I can defend. For some time I have turned a blind eye to so many mistakes I have made during my data analyses because I was so stressed and afraid of the backlash from my supervisor.

Also it is my greatest shame and regret that I have tampered with the samples of my 2-3 experiments to make the results more clear and obvious.

I have been writing my thesis for some time now and this has caused my a tremendous amount of fear, stress, guilt and shame. I was already completely burntout from working literally everyday, including weekends and holidays, for 5 years and the feelings coming from my own mistakes really started to kill me inside. I ended up talking to my supervisor and took the incorrectly analyzed data out from the thesis and did the experiments properly with untampered samples.

Now thinking back, I don't know what I was thinking or what made me do those things. Nonetheless, I am still overwhelmed by guilt and shame. I feel like I have comitted the cardinal sin in academia. My supervisor wants a publication out of my thesis even though I believe data is still very rudimentary and needs a lot on top. I can't trust myself to do experiments anymore because of the things I've did and every new experiment feels like life and death. I am psychologically in shambles due to the massive burnout and the guilt, and I do not know how I can handle doing experiments for a publication, writing my thesis and managing my burnout/depression at the same time.

1mn1why,"Surviving an online asynchronous course during a job search, other issues, and fellowship disbursement (long post)","I'm a recent graduate from a PhD program in Experimental Psychology as of this past Thursday. My only obligations at this point are making sure my dissertation is finalized the way the graduate school wants it by September 15th at the latest. However, I made sure to format it the way they wanted it when I sent it back on Tuesday to them. They'll get back to me on August 15th with feedback too. If I do need to make changes, they'll be minimal hopefully since I made sure I followed the format.

For this past academic year other than June through August since I had to attend a week long conference, had an emergency room visit for a benign liver cyst, and a summer internship for 8 weeks, I've been totally unemployed and worked up to 10 hours a week at most. My only obligations in this case were applying to jobs with the help of vocational rehabilitation and working on my dissertation. My commitments were kept to the bare minimum mainly because I've had severe mental health issues ever since April 2022 and they were at their worst during the 2023-2024 academic year since that was when I got partially hospitalized and had to miss around 3 weeks of lecture and had to go online asynchronous. When I got a re-evaluation at 29 in August 2023, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD, and major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent. My neurodivergent conditions (that I already knew about when I was younger thankfully) are ASD level 1, ADHD-I, motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed. I also have what my neurodivergent affirming therapist and neurodivergent community call ""autistic burnout."" If you don't know what it is, definitely Google it or ask ChatGPT since it's not complex at all.

My last point is that I currently have fellowship money saved at the moment. This fellowship allows me to accept up to $35k. For every third I accept, which is $11,667, I need to do a year's worth of full time service credit as faculty, staff, or administration to keep it. I can also only get one year's max before I graduate too, which I already got since I was a visiting full time instructor in 2023-2024. This instructor position went horribly for me sadly since my ratings were in the 2s out of 5 on most categories and in the 1s out of 5 on those categories the last semester I taught (same semester I was partially hospitalized too). This was despite reusing all of the materials from folks who taught the class previously as well as their slides and activities. I plan on returning the $23,333 that I have left saved so I can avoid being the obligation of having to find a higher education position a year after I graduate before it turns into a loan. Even if it does signal to the state that gave me the fellowship that I'm done with trying to be in academia, I'm alright with it given that I didn't learn anything in graduate school at all. This isn't hyperbole either given that I only got by in coursework due to help from my cohort, advisors copyediting in what they wanted to see from me when I had issues following feedback (handling feedback is the worst for me), and more that I won't mention such as how my first PhD advisor dropped me.

Between all of these issues and more, I'm looking for advice on how I can manage myself for teaching this 8-week online asynchronous course I'll adjunct this upcoming semester. Notably, I don't need to upload any lectures or create any new material at all. I do need to grade though. I plan on reusing my old course shell from the last time I taught it in Spring 2023 since I made my own answer keys from the old materials I got when there weren't any at first.

For those also wondering, I'm only doing this so I can get income, even if it's meager. I don't have any interest in becoming a full-time instructor or anything like that at all given my awful experience when I tried last time. I only did that since my first PhD advisor and current PhD advisor thought going academic was the route for me. Listening to them was a mistake. I had an offer in June 2024 for an instructor position that was full-time and possibly renewable, but I declined it so I could stay with my parents and wrap up my dissertation. After I sent the email saying I declined (after I asked for a one week delay to make a decision too), they ghosted me and didn't even wish me luck. When I told my current advisor that I declined it two months later, he didn't seem to mind at all.

1k42vy2,Landing Bachelor's level jobs even though I'd be overqualified for them?,"Full transparency that I made a post earlier about looking for postdocs, but I deleted that post as I now remembered how disastrously a postdoc would go for me given that my PhD has been nothing but a disaster. The bullet points below will contextualize why this PhD set me backwards rather than forwards. You can skip them though if you wish.

1.) First PhD advisor dropped me due to a dispute over how I managed the lab. She advised me from 2020 (my first year)-2022.

2.) Program chair thankfully takes me as an advisee. At this point though, my autistic burnout and PTSD (yes, it's clinically diagnosed) were so bad that I could only focus on doing one research project at a time (my first PhD advisor made me only work on one project at a time) and still am only working on only my dissertation. I put in 10-20 hours per week's worth of work this academic year.

3.) My stipend got cut in half my 3rd year due to university budget issues. Same tuition waiver was intact thankfully, so I got the rest of my program paid off at that point.

4.) I got a visiting instructor gig at a nearby SLAC my 4th year and bombed it horribly (this is not hyperbole either, I got 1-2s out of 5 across the board on all categories). Thankfully, it fulfilled service credit for me to keep some fellowship money.

Now, I'm graduating without any new skills compared to my Master's at all and am going to be overqualified for the majority of stuff I actually want to do that's in line with my current abilities. I just want the autistic burnout itself to go away mainly. I hate that I've lost so many skills, including when I used to read and write for sustained amounts of time.

Getting to the point though, how can I approach applying for the Bachelor's level jobs I want that would be in line with my actual abilities? I need work that has clear directions, little freedom, etc. given that I did the bare minimum throughout my PhD. I'm applying to Research Assistant and Clinical Research Coordinator positions mainly. I particularly wished I was a Clinical Research Coordinator the entire time instead of going for my PhD as I get to work on pre existing studies without having to resort to too much executive functioning, leadership, and independence.

I've considered hiding my PhD entirely, hibernating my LinkedIn, and changing where graduate assistantships are mentioned to ""researcher"" instead. The only tricky thing about hibernating my LinkedIn is that there was an article from my university covering me at one point that's present as well as my name on an admissions page too. I'm highkey mourning a bit as I'm writing this. Wasted all of my 20s thinking that being a PhD was just more of being a research assistant, but it was so much more than I realized in this case.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1k42vy2/landing_bachelors_level_jobs_even_though_id_be/
1gcl8hy,Failed My Qualifying Exam (Again),"Hey all! I failed my 2nd attempt at my qualifying exams and I've been asked to leave with a masters. I don't know how to feel about it and I just feel so defeated. 
I've been quite burnt out with my work for a minute now. My PI did not really help me find a direction to work on and really have not been present for guidance. I spent my first 2 years just doing anything in the lab I can do. I spent my 3rd year working on a project that I was interested in but it led nowhere. I attempted my first exam early this year and failed miserably. I was not aware of the kind of scope that will be covered in the exam. My PI told me to just understand what I'm proposing and that should be good. What I was asked was way beyond that, and on material and application from adjacent fields that are related to my committee. They also thought my proposal was too broad, although it was never brought up to me prior to my exam.  Since then, I've been working hard to narrow down my research question and write a better proposal. They thought it was more defined and I went through the oral exam. I thought it went well but later i was told that me being a 4th year now, they can't have me to stay on and complete this degree because I will not finish in time! They were also doubtful that I would be able to do independent research which did not make sense to me because i did all this work by myself so far.  I made sure to chat with all my committee before and prepare all that I could. My PI didn't really offer me much assistance with feedback on my proposal because he said that what I want to do is not within his field. I feel like I exhausted all my options. 

So here we are. I don't know where to go from here. I did not anticipate being in my 4th year and leaving my program. I thought I could push through the burnout and get it but I guess not. I am angry at myself for not leaving earlier. I knew that I'll have to fight through my teeth to get through in my current lab but I was so desperate and so scared of leaving. I guess the decision has been made for me now. In a way I feel a burden lifted. I hated going into the lab most days, due to how unorganized it is, and how it feels so hostile. In my time there I got severely depressed for the first time in my life. I also recently learned that I have ADHD.

I still love research and I want to stay in the field. It's been a life goal for me to get a PhD but I think I should have tried to do it after I figured out what I was really interested in and not jump at the first opportunity. 

I am just so upset about the time I lost. I could have left or transferred at 2 years when I started to question my program. But I'll be leaving at 4.5 years in. I just can't get myself out of this hole I'm sitting in right now. For anyone else who left later and figured things out, can you tell me about it so I know it's going to be okay?

I like neuro a lot. Its always been my worst subject but also what I find most interesting. I've even loved inpatient shifts while working... stroke service. But everywhere I go I see insane resident burnout, horrible resident hours even compared to other fields, difficult learning curves, and the field constantly finding its way on the top list of least life satisfaction and job satisfaction specialties. Do people who go into neuro  find themselves in my shoes of loving the field, but soon lose their glimmering wide-eyed beauty? Is this what would happen if I stepped down the path? Would I hate life as I work harder than others to make less and eventually just be miserable?

I'm in my late 40s with a few young kids and while I have certainly enjoyed catching up on life, last year I decided to take on some part-time adjunct work at a local college.

In my third semester now, teaching 2 classes (which I enjoy for the most part) and considering applying for a full-time position that is open in my department. I'm guessing I would end up teaching at least 4-5 classes/semester which obviously would be a big increase in the number of hours I'd have to spend in class, grading, meeting with students, etc. each week.

I'd like to hear from other people who have made the jump to full-time teaching - is it worth it compared to a full-time corporate job? I mean, clearly the pay sucks but with summers and winter breaks off.... seems like work/life balance could be better. I do enjoy having SOME free time but I am concerned that 4-5 classes might just suck the remaining life out of me.

Appreciate any and all insight here. Thank you!",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1isew1j/should_i_take_this_fulltime_teaching_position/
1huww43,"I'm almost there, yet I feel helpless ç_ç","Hi everyone! I think the title says it all.

I'm in the writing process of my PhD thesis (humanities). Theoretically, I should live in a state of perpetual adrenaline release, and my stamina should be at its highest.

Yet I feel quite the opposite. I think that paradoxically enough I'm experiencing a burnout, as a result of a very difficult PhD experience.

1. My main supervisor has not been helpful through my PhD. Rarely answering emails, I had often to call him and one time I had even to wait for him outside the classroom where he was giving lecture, in order to talk about some urgent matter with him.

While he \*once\* wrote for me a presentation letter that let me win a very   important fellowship, he was never there to write further presentation letters that I needed (once because of his own negligence, other times he was so difficult to contact that I couldn't even talk about what I needed).

2. My project proved to be utterly difficult, and it took a toll on my mental and physical health. It needed extensive archival research to be done through Europe (I'm Italian), often within private archives not easy to access. Imagine spending three years travelling from one city to another one, with almost non-existent financial support by my home university. Not to mention the continuous negotiating with professionals who spoke a language different from mine (this has been very helpful from one side tho).

While I had partly anticipated this, I didn't imagine that my own supervisor and other professors wouldn't have cared for my efforts nor wouldn't make me feel validated. I didn't start for sure this PhD fantasizing about becoming everyone's puppy, but didn't even expect senior scholars to be so apathetic.

Basically I'm in a phase where I feel conflicted about what I've achieved (which is a lot) vs this veil of pessimism above me. I don't feel motivated, I feel like these three years have been useless and I see even more uncertainity for the years to come. I want to try to concentrate now as I have to finish this damn thesis at all costs.

End of rant.

However, I’ve been having a really hard time in my current lab and it’s making me think I may not be cut out for a research degree.

I’m currently doing an independent project as a continuation of my major thesis. I’m a cog sci major, but I’ve pivoted towards biomedical engineering in terms of research. This has me feeling VERY behind, as most of my peers in the lab have a background in BME or EE. There are a lot of things I don’t understand, but I really do try to read papers and understand things on my own before I ask for help. I also had to learn MATLAB from scratch this summer, which was difficult at first but I managed to get through it and I use MATLAB now everyday Lately though, I’ve been having some new challenges.

I find myself getting bored with my topic. It is super specific, obviously achievable for an undergrad. Sometimes I’ll bring up my tangents to my PI, who kindly shuts them down and tells me that if I want to publish, I need to focus on my topic.

I also don’t know what exactly I’ll want to research in grad school. I’m generally interested in hearing aids and modeling auditory physiology, but I’m also passionate about neonatal care and hearing. 

I’m also afraid of regretting this career if I start to find it boring. I knew I wanted a PhD early on, so I never really took the time to explore other options.

8sw9gt,[residency]Why you should do Family Medicine - a Resident's Perspective,"Hey everyone!  I'm a PGY-3 graduating in two days.  I go to an academic tertiary care center and graduated from a top public Midwest medical school and couples matched with my wife who does internal med.  For the right person, family medicine can be an amazing opportunity with plenty of impact in your patient's life and also a great lifestyle as well.  Onto the good stuff.

**The Years**

* PGY-1: This is the hardest year of residency from an hours standpoint as you do the most inpatient intern year.  It ranges from the ob floor, general medicine floor, and ICU.  Throughout this year you'll also have clinic either within the rotation itself or in blocks.  Be prepared for a whirlwind experience and you'll likely average close to 60 hours a week.

* PGY-2: Easier hours wise, but still can be daunting.  You're now considered a ""senior"" so you'll be taking charge on the inpatient service, and expected to see a higher number of patient's during your clinic blocks.  However, this year is more outpatient heavy, so expect more office type hours.  You also get to do more off service rotations.  

* PGY-3: Senior on campus.  Should be the easiest year of your residency.  Again, you'll be leading inpatient teams and be the most senior resident on-call, but hopefully you've gained enough experience your second year that you feel more than able third year.  I really enjoyed this year and spent more time on teaching, efficiency and research.  Your outpatient clinic also ramps up and I saw up to 10 in a half day.  Also, this is the most outpatient of all the years plus elective time so hours are much better.  You'll also be rotating in a lot of different departments so while it may feel like 3rd year of medical school, you can go to each specialty you visit with very specific questions.  I also found that specialties were very appreciative of the work we did and very open to teaching and helping figure out if that was something we could manage ourselves or refer.  Third year is also when you find a job which is incredibly easy.  My wife matched for fellowship and I had vacation in 4 weeks.  I started applying to her city and had 6 different interviews lined up for that one week of vacation in a New England city.  I'd say I average 50 hours or less third year.

**Typical inpatient day:**


* 6:45-receive sign out from overnight team

* 7:00-8:30 - preround

* 8:30-11:00 - round

* 11:00-12:00 - call consultants, notes, orders

* 12:00-1:00 - noon conference/lunch

* 1:00-6:00 - admissions, follow up on patients, learning, etc. then sign out

**Outpatient day:**

* 8-12 - see patients

* 12-1 - conference

* 1-5 - see patients

To talk more about the outpatient world you'll end up in a variety of clinics.  My primary two clinics were the acute care clinic (cellulitis, asthma exacerbation, URI's, sore throats, etc.), continuity of care clinic (diabetes, HTN, annual physical exams).  We also rotated through other clinics including procedure clinic (IUD's, Nexplanons, shave, excision, and punch biopsies, treadmill stress test, colposcopies) our MSK/sports medicine clinic (injections, ultrasound, MSK issues) and also nursing home rounds (travel to the nursing home and round on patients) and also free medical clinic work.  Of course when you rotate on a different specialty you'll experience their flavor of medicine.  Also procedures were not limited to the procedure clinic.  Simple procedures like cryo, Nexplanon, punch biopsies and joint injections I did during all clinics.  

**Call:** We had weekend call coverage where you would cover a 12 hour shift depending on the rotation you were on.  Night float covered Sunday night-Saturday morning with three 12 hour shifts on the weekend to cover.  It was easy to trade call shifts.  Different places have different schedules.

Procedures: Covered in the procedure clinic.  I should also mention that some residencies will train you to do c-sections, are very active in you first assisting in surgery, or have you do screening colonoscopies/endoscopy.  

**Fellowships:** Sports medicine, geriatric, ob (train to do c-sections), hospitalist, medical education, informatics, sleep.  All generally are one year fellowships.  

**Who is a good fit in family medicine?**

* You want to do it all, or you want to not do it all.  It is very easy to create a schedule that works for you.  Want to be the do it all doctor who rounds on his inpatients, sees clinic patients, covers the ER, and then delivers babies?  Rural FM is for you.  Want to make six figures working part-time at an urgent care?  Easy.  For full scope FM you'll be restricted to rural areas, but for everything else you can go rural, urban and suburban with jobs available everywhere.  I'll generally talk about outpatient FM as that's the trend for most graduates.  

*  You enjoy talking with patients and like having continuity.  I've watched patients lose 50 lbs during my residency.  I've seen a diabetic exercise and lose weight and his A1c is now 5.1 completely off of medicine.  Though you also see that cirrhotic slowly circle the drain and pass away.  The diabetic wound that turns into an amputation.  You do goals of care conversations for your dying patients.  All my nursing home patients who I had at the beginning of residency have passed away.  I convinced one of them to go onto hospice.  I've delivered babies and seen them through the first years of life which is really incredible (or at least I think it is).  

* Most of medicine fascinates you.  I get to dabble in a little bit of everyone's field.  I'm currently working up a primary hyperthyroidism, treated chlamydia, sent a smoker to ENT for a laryngoscope for hoarseness, had to look up the work up for abnormal uterine bleeding, discussed PSA testing the list goes on.

* You want people to live their best life.  This applies to all of medicine, but in family medicine this means an emphasis on prevention and success can look different.  Instead of performing the heart saving cath, you counsel on diet, exercise and get appropriate people on a statin.  Instead of cutting out the cancer in the colon you convince people to get colonoscopies or do FIT testing.  There isn't that instant rush like other specialties, but it's very rewarding in it's own right.  

* Training: Our residency is only three years and it is definitely not the hardest one out there.  

**Cons:**

* Money: We're one of the lowest paid specialties.  Lifestyle wise it's very cush, but you're not pulling in half a million like derm does with their office life.    

* The unknown: You have to be okay with uncertainty.  Not every cough is lung cancer and not every cough needs a chest x-ray, but when you miss something, which will happen to you eventually as not everything is textbook, it can be devastating.  Along those lines, you can't know everything and you will hit things that you need to look up or maybe refer before you really want to.  

* Prestige: While a good FM doc is generally well respected it certainly isn't prestigious.  That being said, everyone in FM is generally down to earth and great to hang out with.

* Burnout: Some patients are nasty and that's just a fact of life.  You have to fight insurance companies.  The day is very fast paced and you'll see a lot of patients and documentation is a drag.  

I really love FM and am excited for my career.  I will be working slightly outside of a major Northeastern city working 4 days a week 8-5.  I will have occasional phone call which goes through a nurse triage line.  This generally means I get 1-2 calls when I'm on phone call.  I can't be drunk/altered, otherwise no restrictions.  I'll be making around 240k with bonuses.  

My wife is going to be a fellow in some internal med subspecialty and I'm excited to support her in her career.  I envision myself going part time shortly after she becomes an attending.  

For the right person FM can be a really rewarding career and nice lifestyle.  Let me know if you have any questions!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sw9gt/residencywhy_you_should_do_family_medicine_a/
1muq8k4,Advice: Spending 3rd Yr Elective in IM specialty or EM?,"I'm a DO student trying to decide whether I should spend my 3rd year elective in an IM specialty or EM. I'm torn between the two and still trying to decide if I like OP or IP. Started rotations mid July and my elective slot is early Feb. 

For either option, I would likely have to shop around as I've heard a lot of classmates having issues with hospitals with strict existing school contracts. I have heard that because our DO school sends out students to quite a few places, I might have a better time finding slots as a partner hospital.

My rotation schedule has EM as the first rotation in 4th year (I believe August) which is a tight turaround to VSLO deadline.

IM specialty

* Current hospital only has an FM residency and most IP attendings are FM trained. Would like more exposure to IM trained attendings at a larger hospital
   * We do OP IM specialties (neuro, addiction, and PCP)
* Get to have some more exposure and direction on what I want would want specialize in 
   * Thinking hem onc, rheumatology or nephro
* The only mark I have against(?) this is I have time during IM residency to figure this out

EM

* Would like to go to a Level 1 Trauma Center (current hospital is level 3)
* See how a different EM department runs 
* Figure out if this lifestyle is for me (the burnout comments have me really terrified)

1m359mg,How to accept to prioritize your mental health and not the PhD?,"TLDR: Despite a probable burnout, I still always feel like I should be more productive.

  
I am now in my second year of my phd in Germany, and I'm paid (nicely) and have little constraints, so I should be grateful for this. However, since the very beginning, I haven't been able to focus much due to various issues (emotional numbness, ADHD, and now grief). My supervisor is a very efficient person, the type of person that hyperfocuses on work even more if life gets hard, the type of person who does a PhD very quickly. To catch up my low productivity (especially by his standards), I work late in the evenings, and because I only start to get productive and random times like 1 am, I can get to sleep at 5 am, while still setting my alarm at 8:30am. Of course, because I'm exhausted, the cycle repeats itself and I never really fully rest. 

Honestly, I'm fully aware that the best idea here would to clearly take a break, get away from the screen when I feel unproductive instead of staring at it for hours, go see friends and exercise, see a therapist. All I can think of is ""well just get this done and then you won't be behind and then everything will solve itself"", and if I am not in front of my computer during regular work hours, I feel bad (and that's fully a self-set pressure, it's not like anyone's checking or anything). Plus, my field (AI) moves very quickly so we have to publish my current results soon, which adds to it. I do still take a breather when eating or on some weekends or seeing friends, but I always have in mind that I should finish work after/instead. This need to catch up with the work I need to do overtakes everything even when I know deep down that it isn't realistic, that I can't just get it done in two hours and then feel like I caught up on everything.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you manage to break out of it? Is this relatively normal in academia, and I just struggle to keep up?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1m359mg/how_to_accept_to_prioritize_your_mental_health/
1n63zew,How to make studying addictive again.,"I'm not a heavy texter so some of you might not even see this as venting.

I used study IT for GCE exams and I was behind everyone. I got to know a teacher (in our school teaching the same subject for Advanced level students) who does private tutoring. 

Everyday he would give a basic website image printed/ written as a client request to write in HTML. And because of everyday of writing out code, I got so hooked up to IT that I still love IT as a subject.

I want to find something like that in medicine so I don't burnout as much, and I know that noones there to handout projects to make things addictive again tbh.

So if there's something out there other than anki (or a better introduction to anki cuz I screwed up months ago), please let me know.

1n1mvl0,Advice on LORs and Electives to a 3rd yr (EM/IM),"I'll try to keep this direct and to the point bc I know we don't all have time for essays.

OMS-III, interested in EM or IM. Older, non-trad career changer. My main target for residency is to be back in a mid sized city - pre-clinicals were also in a rural town.

Current rotation site: community hospital, level 3 trauma center, no IM residency.

Research: None right now, but at least will have one by the end (school required).

EM: I'm trying to do my spring elective in EM at a different site bc I'd like some more exposure. My mandatory EM is 1st block 4th yr. Running into lots of roadblocks as a 3rd yr, with those slots going to 4th yrs (to be expected). My main knock against this specialty is the burnout tales and that others have said there are no ""old"" ED docs. I'm already old and don't plan to retire just as I'm starting. Also, there's no plan B for this specialty (no OP work that I know of other than admin which I don't want to do).

IM + LORs: Pro for IM is more subspecialty options and IP/OP options for most specialties. However, residency quality will matter when it comes to matching fellowships.

My main concern is I won't have an IM PD letter (no home program). Our site dean is pretty involved and usually writes LORs (assuming we don't do something stupid) but he's not IM. I didn't ask for a LOR from my very first rotation with a outpatient PCP (IM trained) bc I was getting my bearings and only spent a week with him. I'm considering spending a 4th yr elective with him because he's sharp as a tack and could write me a good letter (he gave a good eval but comments were generic). Problem is I only have 1 elective slot in 4th year before ERAS apps need to be submitted so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to ""get it right"". Should I spend that 4th yr instead at another hospital in IM?

1mihhnc,Reasons for Burnout,"Hi Everyone,

First time posting here. I’m curious to hear some of the reasons for burnout during PhD and want to get a better understanding since I’ve seen quite a few posts here. For background, I’m not a current PhD student. I’ve completed my bachelor’s and master’s, been working full time for 2 years and am looking to apply this fall for a PhD in Accounting that starts Fall 2026.

Some of the causes I’ve read:

1. Workload. Sounds like most of the STEM PhDs require significant hours in the lab, which can be really draining. I’m assuming a PhD in Business will be different in that it doesn’t require lab work? I’m also not expecting to do any experimental accounting research. Could this mean relatively lighter workload?

2. Losing passion. I’ve read that a lot of people lost their passion after 1 or 2 years doing research. I have 0 research experience in schools, but as of now I’m not particularly concerned because 1) I’ve read a few research papers in my field and found them interesting, and 2) I have related work experience that sometimes involves doing a bit of research (non statistical). But my question is, do y’all think that you’d really have to LOVE your field to survive PhD?

3. Frustration with advisors. This is a very new topic to me since I’ve never had an advisor in grad school and the advisors in undergrad were mainly there to help with administrative stuff. Speaking specifically about PhD in Business, how important it is to choose a compatible and responsible advisor and can I achieve so? If my advisor is not very helpful, how bad would the whole experience be?

4. Loneliness. I’m in a very stable long-term relationship (not married, not kids). Outside of intimate relationships, did you find making friends particularly difficult during PhD? If so, what caused it and how could someone improve this situation?

1lhwct6,What are other careers for medicine that you can do other than being a traditional doctor?,"’m not against becoming a doctor, but I want to make sure I keep all my options open. I’ve just entered my clinical years, and I’m already feeling somewhat burned out.

Currently, I’m on a neurology inpatient rotation, and I really enjoy it. We’re typically done around 2 PM and get close to an hour for lunch. My resident gives me the chance to see a patient on my own and then I present to the attending. It honestly reminds me of the show *Suits*—that back-and-forth professional dynamic—and I really like that aspect of medicine. Can't wait to do that with a different rotation. It like trying a different flavor in an ice cream shop. 

Still, I recognize I’m seeing a “highlight reel” of the profession. I don’t fully know what my attending is doing behind closed doors—charting, admin work, insurance battles, or other responsibilities that aren't visible to me.

Before this, I was on a neurosurgery rotation, and it was a completely different experience. I was waking up at 4 AM and working until 3 PM with no actual lunch breaks—just a granola bar to get me through. On the plus side, I lost some weight, but I knew almost immediately that neurosurgery wasn’t for me. The lifestyle was too extreme and not aligned with what I want long-term. And they were being generous to me because they worked until 7 pm daily. And they had on call for 2 weekends in a roll. 

What I do know is that I value balance**.** I want a career where I can have time for hobbies like rock climbing and working out. I also want to be present for my future family—to attend my kids' basketball games, not just provide financially but be *there*.

Before choosing medicine, I considered engineering, but that also comes with challenges—long hours, fear of layoffs, and navigating corporate politics. I actually worked at a science research company before med school. It was a standard 9–5 job, paid around $60K, and the work was simple. But there was zero upward mobility—most people quit after six months because the job involved nothing more than spinning blood samples. That lack of growth and stimulation pushed me toward medicine.

So here’s where I’m at:

I'm in third year, enjoying aspects of clinical rotations, but also already feeling the weight of the path ahead. I’m aware that medicine can be rewarding, but I also don’t want to blindly follow a path that could lead to burnout or resentment. I want to stay open-minded.

**My questions are:**

* What career paths can someone take with an MD besides traditional clinical practice?
* Does my reasoning for keeping my options open make sense, or am I just overwhelmed by the transition into clinical training?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1lhwct6/what_are_other_careers_for_medicine_that_you_can/

I keep hearing that cold emailing and networking can help, but I honestly don’t know where to start:

* Who should I reach out to?
* What should I say?
* Does it lead to referrals?

If you’ve been through something similar:

* How did you recover from burnout and rejection?
* What helped you regain momentum?
* Any cold emailing tips that worked for you?

Also, if you know any companies still hiring new grads or entry-level engineers (especially with potential visa sponsorship), I’d love to hear about them. Even better if they’re responsive or beginner-friendly.

I’m not looking for sympathy—just genuine advice or even a reality check. If anyone’s in the same boat, I’d love to connect and push each other forward.

1m56q5g,"First week, emotional rollercoaster, hoping to hear from other students who can relate","After the first week of school, (OMS-I) I felt like I had been through an emotional rollercoaster ride. I feel mentally exhausted. Here are my roses and thorn and was hoping to see if any other students can relate or offer some perspective

Roses: 

1) Met a lot of other medical school students through the social event and just walked up to them after class. Everyone was so welcoming and nice, and I felt like I could relate to them. 

2) I had my doubts about the town at first because, honestly, the school work is so busy I hardly have time to focus on that, and I am normally grinding away studying, eating, or exercising.

3) There were a few moments were I felt like I belonged here and could see myself spending the next few years of my life here.

4) Learning anatomy has been a lot of fun, seriously. I downloaded 3D4 anatomy on my ipad it it is amazing. Although the school work will be busy, I am genuinely excited to learn more and gain doctor expertise and knowledge.

Thorn:

1) Massive anxiety, and as more time goes on the more I know I am going to be locked into this path for good. I can't shake off the anxiety and genuinely scared about this 7+ year trip. I keep reminding myself to just enjoy the journey and avoid the ""I'll be happy after finishing medical school, after residency, after becoming an attending, etc..."" 

2) Big financial and time commitment, during my stressful days, I am so scared that'll burn out and fail med school or burnout and lose motivation to finish. I am scared this would lead to time wasted, a steep debt hole, and nothing to show. I knew about this before starting med school, because I guess after everything is said and done, the time commitment and debt just feels so much more real and I can feel the weight. 

3) Part of my anxiety with this is because I keep seeing people on social media say how ""they wish they had done another field"" or ""if you're good at anything else just become anything else"" or ""do anything but become a doctor"" I had gap years before coming here and during those gap years, I couldn't wait to begin my journey towards becoming a doctor. However, I can't help but feel anxious and discouraged after hearing these stories. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1m56q5g/first_week_emotional_rollercoaster_hoping_to_hear/
1m2kutt,In the trenches of burnout,"I finished my first year of my clinical psych doctoral program and I feel absolutely crushed with the most overwhelming burnout and depression I have ever felt. I started seeing a counselor at the student health services at the end of last semester. I know recovery can take a while but I can’t help but feel like such a loser that I’m not feeling better yet. I want to feel like myself again. And I want the enthusiasm, motivation, and productivity I had when I started to come back.

I’ve been trying to prioritize rest and recovery like my counselor recommended but I just got an email with my annual standing letter. When I’m at my best, I take criticism very well but depression and burn out make negative feedback really really hurt. And unfortunately my letter didn’t have much positive feedback. It mainly focused on how I didn’t meet expectations for professionalism (specifically timely task completion and responding openly to feedback). 

I don’t know if it’s the burn out talking but I’m left feeling like I don’t want to pursue a career in academia anymore. I’m scared I’m going to always feel like I’m not good enough and be depressed for the rest of my life trying to achieve expectations that I can’t meet.

1k0h70v,Left academia with an unfinished paper and guilt—what would you do in my place?,"Hi everyone,

Last month, I left academia after finishing my PhD and working as a postdoc for a year. Since then, I’ve been focusing on developing a business idea—something I’m genuinely motivated about—while receiving unemployment benefits. It feels exciting to start something new.

During my PhD, I struggled heavily with depression and burnout. I somehow managed to complete it and continued working, but the symptoms persisted. As I quite my research institute, one thing has been weighing heavily on me: I never finished a paper I began writing last year.

I had promised to submit the paper by March, but I kept missing the deadline. Even just before leaving the institute, I told myself—and others—that I’d finish it soon. I would say that 70% of the work has been done. Several colleagues contributed to this paper, some investing significant time. One in particular, who brought me into the project, knew I was struggling mentally and supported me with incredible patience and kindness. I never wanted to take advantage of that kindness, but now it feels like I have.

I’ve tried to return to the paper recently, but every attempt leaves me feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. Just opening my laptop to work on it triggers a strong urge to walk away. I’m no longer being paid for the project—so it’s not about money. It’s the guilt. I feel ashamed for not keeping my promise to myself, and I feel awful for disappointing my co-authors.

And yet, I do have some little energy to work on my business idea. That gives me some hope, even if I’m still navigating my mental health challenges. Finishing the paper doesn’t matter for my career anymore—I’m done with academia—but I still want to complete it out of respect for the people who supported me, especially my former colleague.

So, I’d love to hear your thoughts:**If you were in my position, what would you do? Would you take a longer break (a few months?) and see if you could return to it with more clarity and energy? Or would you let it go entirely? Or…?**

Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot.

Thank you for reading and for any guidance you might share.

1lv3srq,Debating on grad school/my whole future,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently coming to the close of my bachelor's in chemistry and biochemistry (combined) - going from 3rd to 4th year. Ever since I figured practicing medicine just wouldn't keep me happy after volunteering at a hospital, I've been pretty set on doing a PhD after I graduate to work in something related to chemistry/biochemistry (enzymology, neurochemistry, or medchem).

Over time, as my perspective on what practicing chemistry/biochemistry and being a natural scientist is like has grown, the enthusiasm, care, and dedication I feel I once had in prior years has dwindled.

**My thoughts:**

I'm not sure whether it's due to being burnt out from crunching this degree and every related major course possible at my institution into 4 years or whether I've found out that being a natural scientist and going through the experimental process every day for the rest of my life just isn't for me.

A large part of this may be due to the failure I'm experiencing as a volunteer in a chemistry research lab. I feel as though the experimental process is brutal, unresponsive, and unsatisfying to me - and I'd much rather be making something than discovering it. However, this may just be due to my higher experience in the latter making me unconfident. I also don't even know which of the three fields mentioned prior I want to go into, and it feels as though I need to make this decision to know what lab group I should apply to be a part of.

**My plans:**

With all this coming so fast (and some advice from others) I figured that I may need to take a year gap between graduating and grad school to figure out what I want to do, but the problem is - how??

My initial thoughts are to try and fill the gap in a research lab at my institution or a nearby industry to gain perspective on what it may be like to work in a lab full time before I commit to grad school/that field, but I worry that this won't let me recover from my burnout or discover whether something entirely seperate from science is better for me. The other option is to just spend a year in a job unrelated to science to take a break and see how much I really want to come back.

.

.

TLDR; burnt out at the end of my undergrad. How do I find out what I really want to do during my ""gap"" year, even if that may be not going into academia at all?

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? Sorry if this was quite long, I just wanted to make my context very clear. Thank you so much for reading if you did:) 🫶

1lmmtjw,Dealing with burnout,"I’m currently in the end of my second year, moving towards third year with my probation in a few months and for the last year or so I’ve just been feeling extremely burnt out regardless of things going good in the PhD or not. Just looking for some advice if anyone has any tips.

For some context, I’ve been in higher education for the last 7 years and I think my lack of having an extended break has finally caught up with me. I did my undergrad and after finishing I applied for a master’s. Since I had to wait and had a lot of free time while not having any income, I worked 3 part-time jobs for a few months while I waited to hear back. After getting accepted into my master’s, I still had to work 2 part-time jobs to cover rent and other bills, one of them being overnight sometimes at my university bar. 

I did a Master’s by Research which meant strictly lab work for 2 years but during my master’s I decided to do a PhD (lord knows why). Because my master’s program had a rule that meant you had to submit your thesis before you start any PhD, I basically had to write my thesis in 3 months instead of the usual year I’d have. During the end of writing my thesis I then moved to the new city of my PhD and I remember distinctly having to submit my thesis on a Sunday and then showing up for my PhD induction on Monday.

My PhD has been full of ups and downs (as expected) but over the last year I’ve been feeling so burnt out (with a mix of depression too I think) that’s it’s beginning to bleed into my effort and become slightly noticeable. I’ll arrive to the lab around mid-afternoon, work throughout the evenings and sometimes into the night, come home and revenge procrastinate so I’d stay up late and rinse and repeat. It’s sometimes a battle to get myself to do things and even though I manage in the end, it always feels like a brief relief before it’s onto the next thing. I’ve been trying to use up my annual leave when I can and though the break is good, it usually takes about a day or two of me being back in the lab before the burnout sets back in. My supervisor is also the type that I think brushes off any talk with just “take it easy” while also telling me the things I need to do, and he won’t really say anything unless it starts to show in my results.

I know I basically have around a year left of research then I’ll just be in the writing phase but the workload is only going to go up and I don’t want to keep powering through this blindly. To add to this, I know for a FACT I don’t want to stay in academia and I’m sure that’s also adding to my lack of caring when doing things. I don’t have any concrete plans post-PhD, besides treating myself to a much needed break.

Just wondering if anyone has any tips at all or advice they’d be willing to share. I try and keep up with my hobbies - gaming, movies, TV, reading, anime, manga, basketball - but being stuck in this loop also means that I’ve found it hard to go to the gym (which probably would also help a lot) and because I arrive home late I’d resorted to ordering takeaways a lot. I still try and get my 10k steps in daily and go out when I know I’ve been stuck inside for too long. I’ve also tried to meditate occasionally even though I find it hard to be consistent. I am in the UK and in a concise way, my PhD involves investigating the role of microbial ecology in chronic lung diseases.

1688kfl,Why I quit my PhD,"I felt this was important to post as reading other people’s stories was one of the things that 100% helped me in my journey to leaving academia. So happy to speak to anyone that is feeling unsure.

As someone from a family in which no one had gone to university, I was sheltered from knowing what a career in academia is really like. I enjoyed my undergraduate and masters degree and found them relatively easy, and it only excelled my passion for research and academia. The only career path I had thought of was becoming a researcher in the environmental biology/conservation sector, and to do that I knew I had to do a PhD. Upon starting my PhD I found it hard, but I knew it would be, considering the change in work and the big change of location. However, starting a PhD was nothing like starting an undergraduate degree and was extremely lonely and isolating, but I kept telling myself it would get better. I am definitely someone that benefits from structure, routine, and support, all of which I found were extremely hard to come-by in a PhD setting and I found it increasingly hard to manage my workload. I often felt pressured to things I did not want to do as to not upset my supervisor and felt I had to do things I was extremely uncomfortable with like presenting in front of large crowds. I did not come from the same academic background as most (as I did not attend Russell group universities) and I felt that this was not accommodated for, I was just expected to catch up, even though I had missed years of study that most people already had lots of knowledge of. 

One of the main problems with my project came when I realised that none of the supervisors that were brought onto my project specialised in what I was doing, and my main supervisor had decided to branch out and do something new, which meant I had to very quickly become the expert in an area I had only started learning about. Due to my supervisor being specialised in other areas, she quickly made my projects become related to stuff that was meant to be side projects, and less like the project I had been promised due to the limited training on the areas I was interested in. My main supervisor very rarely gave me good feedback and I would leave every meeting feeling absolutely destroyed and stupid. It got to the point I would feel extremely anxious every Monday morning for the group lab meeting and consider not going. However, as this was always the only thing I had ever wanted to do, I just kept persevering and telling myself things would get better, even though they didn’t. I have always been naturally intelligent, but I have never been made to feel as stupid and humiliated as I have during my time doing a PhD. During the time, I slowly fell out of love with wanting to do research and had decided that I didn’t want to stay in academia after the PhD and would rather work in industry. All I had seen from academia from other students and staff was a life of instability, bad mental health, and extreme competitiveness. Shortly after, I realised that if I don’t want to stay in academia, that what is the point in me doing a PhD? Especially on top of the fact I am earning only just over minimum wage, have barely any rights, and feel constantly out of place (there is still very much a class issue within academia that is a whole other thing I won’t go into). I realised that I am not bound to this, and just because I got in does not mean I need to complete it, especially due to the impact on my mental health. I love my work and what I do, but I do think I should sacrifice everything for it.

I spoke to my supervisor saying that I was thinking about leaving and that I was not enjoying my work. She tried to convince me that leaving was not the right thing to do, that if I left no one would want to hire me in a good position without a PhD and shamed working in ‘low-paying jobs’ like Tesco. This was the nail in the coffin for me, as like I have seen a lot in the past year, these people are not and have never been in anyway relatable to me and I did not want to be surrounded by people that make me uncomfortable , and are classist and rude. After feeling like I was completely alone in this, I read reddit posts from people feeling the exact same way, and other people that left their PhDs to go onto great careers in their subject area. This immediately made me feel so much better and I hadn’t even considered that other people had gone through this because quitting is such a taboo subject in academia. 

Since deciding to leave, although anxious about my future, I can tell it has had a large positive impact on my mental health. I have been more open to meeting up with friends, going outside more, being able to cook meals again, I have started reading again, I have the energy to watch movies again, and have even started taking up new hobbies. These are all things I didn’t even realise had slipped away from me until they came back. More importantly than anything I am excited about the possibility of having a normal job and getting to just be me for a while.

I want to reiterate, that this post is in no way to put people off academia, this has only been my experience, and the point of sharing it is to just be honest with others about how academia has felt for me and the impressions it has given. I was definitely under a lot of circumstances that make it worse than the average person doing a PhD, which definitely exaggerates how my experiences were. But I think it is super important for people to stop sacrificing their mental health just to cling on to academia, because it is not worth losing yourself to. I have seen many other students go through the most awful periods of depression and anxiety because of their PhD and I wish that the option of leaving was a more comfortable subject between students and supervisors. I am happy to answer questions about anything, I wish I had also had access to this information at the start.

EDIT: Also feel it’s important to say, I went through school, undergrad, masters, PhD all with no break and working to fund all of them at the same time except my PhD which was funded. This 100% contributed to burnout and I would recommend taking a break!!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1688kfl/why_i_quit_my_phd/
1mbs2zh,PhD vs. Industry in Microelectronics? I'm feeling Lost at a Crossroads.,"Hi everyone,

I've been a lurker here for a while and have learned so much from reading about everyone's PhD journeys. Thank you all for sharing. Now, I've come to a crossroads of my own and would really appreciate your perspective.

For my Master's, I'm doing research in III-V semiconductor processing. On a technical level, it's an interesting and relevant field. But here’s my real problem: I don't feel that deep, burning passion for it. You often hear that you need to be obsessed with your topic to survive a PhD. The thought of spending the next 4-5 years focused solely on this doesn't excite me so much, and I'm worried about burnout. This leaves me feeling lost and going in circles with three options:

**Do I pursue a PhD in my current field anyway?** The practical side of me says this makes sense. III-V is a ""hot"" area, and I already have experience. But I'm genuinely concerned that a lack of passion will make it a miserable experience.

**Do I try to find a different PhD topic?** Maybe there's another area in microelectronics that would truly fascinate me. But switching fields feels risky. I'd be starting from scratch and competing against others who already have a background in that specific area.

**Do I just go into industry?** Maybe this feeling is a sign that a PhD isn't the right move for me now. The job market here is great (Bosch, Infineon, TSMC etc.), and perhaps working on different real-world projects would help me figure out what I actually enjoy.

Has anyone else been in this spot, feeling just ""okay"" about your research when it was time to decide? Did you stick with it and grow to love it as you became an expert? Did you successfully switch to a new topic? Or did you find that your true calling was in industry after all?

Any stories or advice would be incredibly helpful right now. Thanks. >3",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mbs2zh/phd_vs_industry_in_microelectronics_im_feeling/
1muwwag,"Looking for Career Advice — Internship, Graduation, and Next Steps","I’m currently in a bit of a pickle and would appreciate some outside perspective.

I’m a CS major graduating in May 2026, and this past summer I interned as a SWE at a company I’d really like to build my career with. That internship has now transitioned into a part-time role for the school year (15–20 hours/week) that starts next week.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

1. **Return Offer Path**
   * I interviewed with another team (full-stack) at a different location from the one I am at now, but unfortunately didn’t get the return offer.
   * The interviewer encouraged me to reach back out if I’m available for another internship next summer.
   * The catch: that would mean delaying graduation, relocating away from family (potentially for a couple years), and there’s no guarantee of a return offer after the internship.
2. **Current Part-Time Role**
   * My role now involves a heavy engineering project (C++/Arduino) — a space I don’t see myself in long term and at my current location. They do a lot of embedded and have a niche tech stake that will not help me in transferring these skills to possible other companies.
   * I’ll have support on the project from a some non-swe engineers, but I’m concerned about burnout balancing this role, school, and prepping for interviews for other companies
   * Part of me feels this time might be better spent on LeetCode/interview prep and pursuing roles more aligned with my career goals.

So my questions are:

* Should I double down with this company (long-term opportunities, lighter interview process), even if it means delaying graduation and working outside my focus area?
* Should I drop a class to make the internship workload manageable?
* Or should I pivot now, focus on interview prep, and pursue other opportunities that better align with my long-term interests?
* Should I consider dropping the part-time role but still accept the internship at the other location next summer? (I’m leaning toward this, but part of me feels like I’m being a baby for not just pushing through.)

1ks75m4,"Just another “I want to quit my PhD, here's  a rant + please give me advice"" post","So I (25), am in a cognitive neuroscience/psychology program in the U.S., have just finished my first year of grad school, and been grappling with the urge to quit. Quick warning, this is going to be stupidly long, but I guess it's helping me to deal with things. 

If you'd still like to offer advice, but aren't looking for reading material, I've marked at the bottom in bold where I finally get to it. I'd really, *really* appreciate it.

**The background:**

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with my program. It’s great—I’ve made a few friends in my cohort, my advisor is awesome, and the department is incredibly supportive. I’ve been doing pretty well, all things considered.

I’m usually a perfectionist, pouring everything into whatever I do. Yes, that can absolutely be a recipe for burnout. And for a long time, even before starting the program, I thought, “Maybe that’s it. Maybe I’m just burnt out, and need to push my way through it.”

All I’ve really identified with, with any pride anyway, is academia. You know, the whole “top of the class” persona in grade school. Even after I crashed out from that mentality, I just sort of shifted back into it in my undergrad, taking on way too many RA positions and duties—honors thesis, TA-ships, early publications and all, all to get where I am now.

I went straight into a post-baccalaureate position after, where I guess I just finally ran out of juice. That, and I actually started to live like a real young person with the amazing friends I made there. I fell behind on work, and kept slipping into bouts of escapism, so I wouldn’t have to face the pile of guilt next to the grave I dug in it. As it got worse, I pulled away from my social support and just started working from home. I was, without exaggeration, straight up failing, just not doing the things I needed to do, for the first time in my life.

I felt like there was something wrong with me, and I just needed to get back to the old me, the one that could actually do things and could do them *right*.

And here I am, having paid the application fees, plastered the perfect smile on my face, recited the practiced elevator pitches and research plans, and pretended to love the process enough times to make it into the place I still thought, would finally fix everything. Or finally make me proud of myself.

Like I said, I’ve actually done decently, but ridiculously slow. Not just in the way all academics hold themselves to high expectations. I genuinely couldn’t get myself to do even basic tasks for weeks, ones that when I finally forced myself to, took me maybe thirty minutes. I panicked at the thought of meeting with my advisor, having to find something to report on or some excuse why it was taking so long. I was disgusted with myself for my lack of output, and what it meant about me. So to stave off ever actually feeling any of the guilt I was carrying, I played games, listened to books, watched shows—anything to escape.

Again, I had never done this before. I had never, ever found myself *just not caring*, and I couldn’t recognize myself.

I know I probably sound self-pitying, but I just feel angry, scared, and sick honestly.

I know I’ve really just been lying to myself, more than anyone else, that this is for me. Being a scientist is the only part of me I know how to be proud of. But it’s also the only thing I’ve ever really let myself consider, and one of the only prestigious-sounding things that were encouraged growing up, socially, and financially.

I know I love the idea of it, the conferences, the talks, and probably, the self-respect I can’t stop believing I’ll find through it one day. But I also know that I don’t have any love for the process, the moments that the real, present-version of me has to live through. And I know that there’s been nothing wrong with me—I’ve felt more and more like this the farther I’ve gotten in therapy, and I do have passions I can lose myself in that could be financially supportive.

So, I know I want to quit. The moment I thought of a life outside academia, I think I felt this ridiculously-cheesy sounding sense of freedom. Maybe I could finally settle in somewhere, without the sense of looming doom of having to find yet another apartment, another location, that wasn’t a thousand miles from my partner for once. Maybe trips and life milestones and even having decent money while I’m still young weren’t just pipe dream fantasies reserved for everyone else.

None of this is to bash academia or anyone who loves it. I envy you, really. I just wish I could love it more, and enough to make the journey worth it for myself.

**That’s the way too long expose.**

I have an exit plan. I could find a job in data science with my skills and undergrad statistics focus, and with real free-time, maybe even finally dare to try to find the creative pursuit I’ve been starving for. I could move back in with my wonderful partner, who makes enough for both of us—so it'd be okay if I didn't find a new job immediately.

But the way of thinking that’s kept me here is a hard habit to shake. I keep thinking about my PI and my previous advisors, the one’s who looked at me and my work and saw potential. I think of the whispers I’d leave—that I couldn’t take it or I wasn’t strong or smart enough. I know it stupid, but it’s there.

**Here's the part where I actually ask for advice.**

**(1)** I can get a master's before leaving if I finish out the next year and complete my courses. I already have a lease for the next year signed for a new apartment here. But I want to be honest with my advisor, who's been nothing but good to me and would deserve to know and plan for it - and probably would want to go ahead and hand off my project to someone else. Still, I'd probably be dropped the moment I mentioned it, right? If I finally find the nerve to leave, when should I say it?

**(2)** How do I actually do it? How do I leave behind this part of me I don't really know how to exist without? How do I deal with the disapointment that I'll cause? Even though I know it's a temporay pain for a really important long-term decsion, I'm not a brave person.

So atm I’m about to finish my 1st year of med school, and honestly along with other feelings of resentment/general burnout, I’ve lately started to feel a lot of fomo and regret from my decision to come here. 

Even during undergrad, I felt the same, that I was sacrificing a lot of fun and life to get here, but I guess I kept telling myself that this would be a smart investment and that I would be able to make up for it later on in life. But now that I’m almost done with M1, I’m starting to realize how much freedom medical school (and this career path in general) really takes away from you. I see a lot of my friends from the past who got normal 9-5 jobs being able to have the freedom to live and travel anywhere, go out to bars, clubs, etc. while I’m stuck in a location in the middle of nowhere because this is one of the only schools I got into. And from what I understand, we don’t necessarily have much freedom to choose where we go for residency either. In my mind, this pretty much means that we don’t have any freedom location-wise for 7+ years. Not only that, we have to spend so much time studying that it’s hard to go out and live/enjoy life like other people.

I came from a larger city and also went to a big party school for undergrad, so moving to where I’m at right now has really made me feel a lot of fomo, especially seeing my friends from home enjoy their lives. I’ve tried to replicate these experiences where I’m at now, but its been really difficult not only because of the small city im in, but also because I feel like the friends I’ve made in medical school are also very busy and serious about school, and so aren’t as open to going out and having fun compared to friends I’ve made in the past. 

All of this has really culminated into me being unhappy with my life here and has honestly been bothering me for awhile. I’m just curious if any of you guys have had similar experiences during your years, and if so how you’ve managed to deal with them. Really appreciate anyone who can chime in, thanks a lot.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/127a0vn/dealing_with_fomo_and_regret_in_medical_school/
1mb9yaq,Career change into becoming a therapist and feeling under-qualified for grad school programs,"Hi all, I'm considering a career change to become a therapist. I got my undergraduate degrees in Psychology and Sociology in 2019 and after I graduated I went into Talent Acquisition/Recruiting at the time because I didn't think I could handle more school at the time and I wanted to start pay off my loans before accruing more. 

Currently, I'm considering going into therapy. I applied last year in 2 MSW programs for Fall 2025 and honestly probably delusional to think I could get into one because I don't have formal social work experience, but I was just so burnout from work it was all I had the energy to apply for.    

  
I've been looking into MFT programs lately because someone suggested it maybe a better fit and the training is a bit more structured for therapy compared to MSW. I started researching some schools today. For context, I live with family in the Bay Area in California, and I'm planning to live with the duration of grad school (bc CA is expensive and while I have savings for grad school, I don't think I could also support the cost of living on my own and am considering not working full-time during my 2-3 year grad school program) so my options are limited to the Bay Area. 

A lot of the state schools require letters of recommendation from 1) clinical supervisors and 2) professor or university level instructor I don't currently work in a clinical setting and I'm not sure how to gain that experience. Also, I went to a larger public university for undergrad, with large class sizes so there wasn't a lot of opportunity to get close professors (applied to a lot of labs/internships but I only ended up with one that was grad student led and I'm not sure if that would count).  

  
Private schools are a little bit more lenient with requirements for letters of req, open to professional or academic recs but the program tuition average is $80k (public state schools are on average half of that)

  
I guess I'm looking for advice on how to make my application more competitive (what would be considered clinical work exp that I could get into with only a undergrad degree, preferably part time and volunteer so I can hopefully still work corporate while trying to gain that experience) and $80k is truly an investment, is it worth going the private route for those who chose it and have started a post grad school career?

qpccia,The post college/grad school depression isn’t nearly discussed enough,"I (24NB) received my master’s degree about six months ago now and started my first “big person” job in the non-profit world shortly after. On the surface, everything’s going pretty well: my job is tolerable most days, I’m valued and appreciated by my boss and coworkers, I’m salaried full-time with benefits, and I’m self-sufficient in a big city. 

I was more than ready to graduate too. I was dealing with a pretty significant case of burnout shortly before the pandemic hit and covid exacerbated it ten-fold. Receiving my diploma was perhaps the biggest sigh of relief I’ve ever experienced. Now, I’ve been out of school for a hot second but I’m starting to miss it and I feel like I’m missing a major part of my identity. 

This is the first time in my life where I’m not a student with no prospects of going back to school anytime soon and it’s a very uncomfortable feeling. I want to go back for a PhD in the future but my therapist and I have decided that I need some time off from school and I just need to experience life. I 100% agree with this decision but I’ve been struggling with this post-graduation depression. I don’t know how to deal with it. *What the hell do I do now?* keeps popping up in my head. 

Logically, my brain knows that grad school was fucking rough (especially during a pandemic) but I feel myself missing the routine, structure, and flexibility of being in school more times than not. In fact, the emotional part of me that is far too nostalgic for it’s own good keeps reflecting on both undergrad and grad school and desperately wants that sense of familiarity back.

I'm two years into my PhD, and have been almost exclusively working from home since 2020 when Covid arrived - anyone else in the same position?

I really struggled towards the back end of last year with burnout, and I've completely lost my rhythm. I spend a lot of time alone at home, and it takes monumental effort to even scratch the surface of my work commitments right now.

Friends and family are supportive, but I don't think they really understand. Lots of people think working from home is a panacea for life's problems - ""at least you can have a cup of tea whenever you want"", ""you can go for a nap and have peace and quiet"", ""you don't have to work!""... 

Lots of responses to this include being told to get out and exercise, go for a walk, take a nap, give yourself a break, but I have such a hard time feeling guilty about not being sat at my desk during the working day.

I'm eternally grateful to be able to do what I do from home, but that doesn't make it easy. I guess it would be comforting to know I'm not alone and there are others in the same boat as me!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1aelk02/doing_a_phd_working_remotely_feeling_burned_out/

Hi All,

Well, here it goes. I’m a first year PhD student, and I failed my bioinformatics course (C). Here’s the context:

1. My grandmother, who raised me from age 2.5, died near the end of the first semester. I somehow passed all my classes (3.7)

2. I had the *fucking brilliant* idea to overload on credits for the next semester, to try to get my passion back. Instead, I burned out by the end of the semester, choosing to focus on the bioinformatics research I am doing in lab instead. (I’m aware of the irony, it stings.)

3. I have a disorder that’s very similar to narcolepsy. This class was at 9 AM, with a 3 point penalty per late/missed class… which I’m guessing dropped my grade significantly- as I had mostly high 80s and 90s on assignments.

I’m waiting on my last grade, which I don’t expect to be good, because of the burnout issue. I know I’m likely not going to be in “Good Standing” - but what do I say? That I’m an idiot that wore myself too thin? A workaholic that couldn’t pull myself away from the bench? Unfortunately, both are true.

My current term GPA is a 3.0, and as long as I get a B for my last course, I should be in good standing. I don’t know why I took an extra two classes (which I got As in), on top of a non-credit course for my fellowship. 
  
Just - argh. Fuck. Shit. I’m sorry, I just needed to yell into the void which is the internet.

Does anyone have advice out there for me?

1jcnr7f,OBGYN vs EM,"OMS-3 here trying to decide between OBGYN and emergency medicine and I'm struggling to pick one. My school is advising I pick soon as EM requires SLOEs from away rotations. 

OBGYN
Pros:
- Continuity of care, following patients over long periods of time and forming relationships with them
- I loved labor and delivery & C-sections
- I love gyn surgery and enjoy being in the OR
- I enjoy the subject matter and learning about women's reproductive health
- I want to work in a fast paced environment and that happens some on OBGYN

Cons:
- I don't enjoy clinic, it's too slow and I don't enjoy wellness exams and the like
- Four year residency program
- 67% match rate for DOs last year
- Requires being on call regularly

Emergency Medicine
Pros:
- I like the idea of being a jack of all trades and dabbling in psych and peds in addition to other things
- Super fast paced environment pretty much all the time
- I like shift work, knowing exactly when and roughly how long you have to work
- There are so many cool procedures to learn!
- No call
- 96% match rate for DOs last year
- Three year residency

Cons:
- High burnout rate
- No continuity of care
- Perception of ER physicians by other physicians I've rotated with (acting like they don't know anything but super basic information)
- Some patients can be difficult or straight up aggressive",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1jcnr7f/obgyn_vs_em/

Since the post and the attention it’s gotten, I’ve been thinking and would like to share some thoughts. First of all, yeah it was kinda scary to name and shame. However, in the real world, there was no actual retribution or knowledge of my identity. I’m still a resident in good standing who’s kicking ass in my program. Second of all, when I talk to friends in other professional careers, they are blown away by how little we feel comfortable sharing in the medical field and how few rights we have. Never forget that the NRMP, USMLE, AMA, etc are MONOPOLIES. We have to remember that there is strength in numbers, and every time someone speaks up against bullshit in a way that names it, the stronger we get and the closer we get to dealing with less bullshit.  We don’t deserve it, and there’s enough literature about how burnout negatively impacts patient outcomes to know that it negatively affects our patients, and they don’t deserve it.

So I guess what I’m saying is that each of our voices (even anonymous) are powerful and valuable and worth being heard. I would like to encourage more of us to speak out, so if you want to and can without repercussions I would like to ask you to consider to adding to my name and shame big dick energy. I would be beyond delighted to hear from more of you below in the comments about the bullshit you’ve faced and how it affected you, so I encourage you to also name and shame.

1l8gb9f,Struggling with Productivity Over the Summer,"Hi friends

I finished M1 a few weeks ago and have been in a bit of a personal crisis since starting the summer. Part of me wants to attribute it to burnout, but I don't think I have worked myself to that point and am instead attributing it to more of a personal failure of discipline.

One of my main goals for the summer is completing SketchyPharm and, time permitting, Boards & Beyond videos for our first organ block next semester. However, I have already eaten through several weeks of summer and have not started anything. The most I've done is kept up with Anking and even then it's a bit of a struggle some days.

The biggest thing plaguing me as of now are the research projects I'm participating in. I have zero experience with research. It's bad. I legitimately feel like I can't do anything unless I have specific instruction or guidance. I'm aware I'm at a point in my career where I should not need to have my hand held through everything, but I feel so lost. It especially hurts when I occasionally see my peers and they tell me all the projects they're involved in and the collaboration going on with networks of students between labs and I'm completely dumbstruck on how they're even able to manage this. I admire them for staying so diligent to work every day since school has let out and am ashamed that I have not. It has tanked my motivation to the point where I just waste hours every day doomscrolling, which all feeds back into this loop of my lack of productivity.

I'm not asking for pity. I want to dig myself out of this rut and get myself back on track but I feel stuck and can't explain why. I think about how productive I used to be during summers in undergrad where I would study organic chem or biochem ahead and feel great while doing it, and now that I'm in medical school where studying is arguably more important, I can't bring myself to do it. If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any advice on approaching the issues I have laid out, it's immensely appreciated.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1l8gb9f/struggling_with_productivity_over_the_summer/

The first one I am currently writing my discussion and the second is still in the data analysis/figure creating stage. All my wet lab work is completely done.

1gxpy36,Please decide my specialty for me: IM or Anesthesia,"I am a current MS4 on research year, completely going back and forth between choosing IM or Anesthesia. Seeking advice from outside sources who may be able to provide some context or advice based on my situation.

By most metrics, IM fits the bill: I'm a people person, like talking to patients, like complicated pathology and disease, like working with a team. It's where the science meets the people. Work-life balance is a priority to me. I can see myself in IM or specialty IM leading an interdisciplinary team, advising patients, teaching. I want to work in an academic setting. Absolutely LOVE teaching and want to teach med students/residents. Have a strong research background and could see myself being fulfilled with part-time research collaborations. 

The downside for me is the tedium: notes, lab values, social work- you name it. Thinking ahead to being an IM resident, I honestly am not looking forward to learning how to manage DKA or about how to steroid taper or bridge surgeon's patients across safely. Seriously, do not care about these details. I think I could tolerate it for 3 years to become a speciality in heme/onc or cards, but the emphasis in IM on rounding, the hours of note writing, and the common dialogue of burnout in IM is concerning to me. And the fellowship match and duration of training is also a concern.

  
Anesthesia offers reprieve: focused scope of practice in the OR or ICU, option to do chronic pain as outpatient, real-time physiology and medications, no notes/rounding. I LOVED my cardiac anesthesia elective: fast paced-medicine in the OR, super high acuity patients, loved working with the surgeons and did a ton of procedures. But I have equivalent concerns about anesthesia: working with PEOPLE is super important to me, and I worry about my ability to sit in an OR all day and do my own thing...alone... I'd miss the patient contact, and also it feels sort of weird not being ""primary"" on a patient or really owning them/diagnosing/definitively *treating* them. At the same time though, everyone I've met in anesthesia is extremely happy with their decision, whereas I can't say the same thing for medicine. 

I think my biggest strengths in the hospital are ability to think quickly, deal with stressful situations, communicate effectively and work in a team, rapport with patients, and my ability to teach others. If I do anesthesia, I see myself doing fellowship 100% in either ICU or cardiac or pain, general ORs could do not do it alone for me. If I do medicine, I would do fellowship in either heme/onc, cards, maybe GI or crit care. Want to work in an academic medical center in both cases, big cities most likely. 

I hear lots of things on these subreddits but genuinely curious what folks would advise for an MS4 in this situation. I have literally a few more months before I need to submit my acting internship rotations, and I need to choose between IM or Anesthesia... please help!

1mcr11c,Masters? Math minor? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!,"Hello all,

I'm a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science at my university, and I'm at a crossroads with my academic plans. Quick backstory: My freshman year was a disaster—I partied way too much, barely scraped by in my classes, and ended up with a GPA that I'm not proud of. I've since turned things around, putting my head down to focus on studying and rebuilding my habits. This turnaround has me motivated to set ambitious goals, like proving to myself that I can excel academically, make a strong comeback, and that I belong in my school/the cs field in general.

My school offers a combined BS/MS program in CS, where I could finish my bachelor's by the end of junior year and spend senior year taking grad-level classes to earn a master's. It's competitive (applications due by the start of senior year), but it feels like a perfect challenge to push myself and my curiosity. That said, I'm wondering if it's truly worth the effort for my career. I'm interested in doing extensive research in the CS field, but would a master's give me any edge in job hunting, especially for entry-level software engineering roles? I know hiring really comes down to your programming skills, problem-solving ability, and projects/internships, but I figure the advanced coursework could sharpen those skills and make me stand out. Or am I overvaluing it? Should I just focus on a solid bachelor's and real-world experience instead?

On top of that, I'm tempted to minor in mathematics. I've always enjoyed math (I knocked out Calc III and Linear Algebra freshman year, despite the chaos), and from what I've read in other threads, higher-level math courses can build ""abstract thinking"" skills that pay off big in CS careers or even just help approaching problems more creatively in the long run. But adding the minor would make my schedule pretty brutal, pushing me to 16-19 credits per semester, especially if I pursue the combined program.

Chasing both seems like a burnout speedrun, and while I'm committed to working hard, I don't want to sacrifice every free hour of college to homework and studying. I still value balance, social life, and good mental health. Should I prioritize the BS/MS program as my ""redemption goal,"" or go for the bachelor's with a math minor for those broader skills? Or maybe neither, and just build a strong portfolio/internships? Any advice from folks who've been through similar paths, especially with combined programs or math minors in CS, would be hugely appreciated.

1jf62ri,Not burnout but moral injury.. My PhD felt like a mind game,"I just learned about moral injury last week, and I really want to share.

**Moral injury** = the psychological distress that comes from witnessing, committing, or failing to act against something that violates your deeply held values and moral beliefs.

It shares some features with burnout, like fatigue and loss of motivation, but moral injury can also bring intense feelings of guilt, shame, anger, and disgust.

I think it’s important to know the difference because taking a break or reducing workload doesn’t help with moral injury. I spent a year struggling with conflicting thoughts, wondering, How could I have burnout when my work schedule felt pretty alright? And this feeling of shame, feeling like I am a beggar because our research group only uses other people's stuff and never contributes to anything because my PI is so stingy.

Moral injury describes my PhD experience pretty well. I started this PhD expecting a heavy workload, but in reality, the workload was manageable. The real struggle was the mind games and the lack of value in the research. A supervisor who encouraged us to be sly and secretive, even stealing from the company we collaborated with because he didn’t have funding. Weekly two-hour meetings that went nowhere.  Asking me to work for half pay for six months because he couldn’t secure a grant.

Then, as I stopped coming to the office as often while supposedly working 50%, he wrote me a recommendation letter criticizing my character and how I spent my free time, telling me I should be working in bars. Later, he told me said it was a joke we should have laughed at and that he was happy with my work.

My defence is in three months. I am getting this goddamn degree and getting out. I don’t know what I want to do next, but I know I need to leave. Sometimes, I feel like a coward for not walking away. I am trying to be okay with not being brave at this moment. It’s in my nature to be stubborn, and I want to get something out of this hellhole. We’ll see how I feel in the coming weeks.. if I change my mind, that’s okay too.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1jf62ri/not_burnout_but_moral_injury_my_phd_felt_like_a/
1aufbny,Have you also lost a bit of your brain power?,"I'm working on a manuscript from my dissertation that I finished nearly 5 years ago. Right after graduating, I went into industry including COVID-work (public health) that's still ongoing, thus putting my manuscript on the back-burner.

I'm nearly finished but it's been a slog. Back when I was earning a PhD, I was in my 30's and living alone (partner in a different state). I read through my dissertation and am so freakin' impressed to the point where I wonder, *""WHERE DID MY BRAIN GO?""*

I don't have the ease of analysis like I did back then, which is causing major analysis paralysis. SO much has changed since 2019 (when I finished). COVID has been a mess and teaching has become a goddamn nightmare (been teaching at the college level for almost 9 years).

I truly excelled during my PhD program. However, I sprinted throughout and experienced pretty awful burnout...I feel like I never recovered honestly. Can burnout really linger all these years? I've since been happily married and productive in my work world besides this one manuscript.

1m460ka,Part-time/experiential/industry PhDs thoughts?,"Hi all, looking for some advice while working through an existential crisis.

I've had a Ph.D. As a life goal for several years, but life, mental health, financial challenges, and other circumstances knocked me off a traditional career trajectory.

Now I find myself an early 30s single male, at a crossroads. I work in biotech and am lucky to be employed as a field application scientist with a large company. Struggling through various jobs through my 20s, and earning a bachelors and masters while working, I recognize I am fortunate to be where I am in life.

My job is stable, well-paid and still involves a lot of learning new technologies and working with scientists regularly. However, there is a part of me that feels incomplete without a doctorate in this field. Last year I applied to and was accepted to an accelerated 3-year PhD program which I was initially excited for to start this fall, but the lab is new and at an R2 university. While I like this PI and we have similar research interests, the current cost-of-living crisis coupled with the decimation of academic funding, impending recession, and biotech layoffs make me extremely hesitant to leave my cushy job in this tough times for science as a whole.

As an alternative, I recently found an R1 university near my current employer that has launched an experiential PhD, where a prior masters degree and industry sponsorship are required. I reached out to the program director and they would consider my application and that I could make a good candidate to apply with my circumstances.

I’ve brought this to the attention my manager and he is open to the idea once I have had enough time to prove myself in my current role and even had some ideas for a collaboration project that could help the company for a research endeavor.

This arrangement seems like it could work but also could be too good to be true. Before I embark on this unorthodox path, is there anyone else who has done a part-time or industry PhD? What are some of the challenges of juggling a research project while working? Is this even feasible or possible? For those who have done it what is the experience like?

While financially this route would make the most sense, giving me some stability while sustaining my education and career, but I have not declined the alternative more traditional PhD option, even if lower ranked and lower paid to avoid burnout. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1m460ka/parttimeexperientialindustry_phds_thoughts/
1lw7g4v,I made thousands on Upwork thanks to coding now lost completely,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old CS student from Poland, and I feel completely stuck right now. For the past two years, I’ve been juggling my degree with freelancing, trying to build an automation/AI agency around tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, and Python.

It started off great - I made thousands on Upwork, built some genuinely complex automation systems for businesses, and got solid technical experience way ahead of my peers. I’ve been coding since I was 14 (2016), and I’ve picked up a bunch of languages, tools, and systems along the way.

But here’s the problem: I tried to scale too early.

I failed my third semester of university while trying to “make it” as a founder/freelancer. The emotional burnout from that hit me hard. Watching old friends from my ""startups"" now land $200K+ jobs at companies like NVIDIA while I feel like I'm spinning my wheels chasing US clients remotely for $1K-$2K projects is crushing.

I don’t lack skills - I can build. I’ve delivered advanced workflows, AI tools, and software systems. But I lack *traction*. I lack *clarity*. I’ve realized that knowing how to automate isn’t enough—I don’t understand sales, I don’t understand the market, and cold outreach feels like screaming into the void.

I’ve got no real income right now, no energy left to hustle on social media, and I’m questioning everything:

* **Should I quit being a freelancer and go all-in on becoming a software engineer?**
* **How do I even start from here - back to Leetcode, apply to Polish dev jobs, aim for remote? I'd love to work in US or e.g. Ireland, even remotely.**
* **Is it too late to pivot, or am I just burned out and tunnel-visioned?**

Here’s my current thought process:

* Upwork gave me quick wins, but it’s unstable and makes me chase short-term money.
* Cold emails, community building, and sales all take time, and I’m just not mentally in it anymore.
* Polish dev salaries are low (\~$1.5K–$3K/mo for juniors), but long-term, SWE might give me peace, structure, and real growth.
* I *hate* playing the social media game. I’m a builder, not an influencer.

If I *do* pivot to SWE:

* Should I finish my CS degree?
* Should I go deep into Leetcode and aim for remote gigs?
* Should I niche down (e.g., backend Python/AI automations) or go generalist?
* Are there better paths in Poland or EU to build a real career without burning out?

I’ve got an LLC in the US (didn’t help much), lots of connections from freelancing (but no recurring clients), and strong tech foundations. What I don’t have is a clear direction, or the energy to keep grinding with no traction.

Would love any advice—from people who were in a similar boat or who made the transition from freelancer/agency life to SWE or product.

Do you want to be someone that works 16 hours a day, 7 days a week and has no close non-academic relationships? Or do you want to be someone that works hard and has fulfilling friendships and hobbies on the side?

Do you want to be someone that can only talk about their area of study? Or do you want to have interesting conversations with people about a variety of topics? On that note, do you want to have diverse knowledge and experiences?

**Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it** \- I'm eyeing a Ph.D. in Computer Science, and I know it's not all sunshine and rainbows. My initial drive was to work with cutting-edge tech, but I've done my homework and realized that's not a guarantee. And you know what? I'm okay with that.  
  
**Here's the deal:** I want to dive deep into Computer Science, way beyond what most people do. Sure, I might not end up implementing the latest AI in some groundbreaking game, but that's not the only endgame here. The Ph.D. is about gaining a level of expertise and problem-solving skills that you just can't get elsewhere.  
  
**I'm not deluding myself** – I know it's going to be tough as hell. Long hours, potential burnout, and the ever-present ""is this worth it?"" question. But here's my take: even if I don't end up working on the bleeding edge, I'll have a toolkit that lets me approach game development (or any software development) from angles most people don't even know exist.  
  
Am I worried about the job market? Hell yes. Am I concerned about the opportunity cost? Absolutely. But I'm also excited about the chance to push myself to my intellectual limits and see what I'm really capable of.  
  
So yeah, I'm going into this with my eyes wide open. It's not for everyone, and it might not be the golden ticket to my dream job. But for me, right now, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. And if I change my mind halfway through? Well, that's a bridge I'll cross when I come to it.

Because of this, I have but one real question for Ph.D. Students out there: **How has your Ph.D. experience helped you develop skills that you believe will be valuable in your future career?**

15snzta,Afraid to pursue a PhD,"I have finished my master's degree in CS and I want to do a PhD. I have thought really hard about it, and I really like doing research. I have consulted many people in academia, and have been told I have the right mindset and am very prepared (maybe too much). However, I have to admit I am very, very, scared.

To not indulge too much, I have autism, which for me sometimes means sensory issues, anxiety, and OCD. Light can be too bright and sounds too loud if I am overstimulated. I got diagnosed in my early 20s as I had symptoms of an autistic burnout, and it affected my studies. I got more tired more easily, and I didn't understand why. I felt sick very often. It also didn't help that I was hard-set on studying all the time, sacrificing sleep and not doing anything fun.

I have learned the importance of work-life balance, and made changes to my lifestyle. I prioritize sleep, exercise regularly and eat properly. Likewise, I tend to say 'yes' more to doing fun stuff with friends and family, and I feel happier overall. I wish to keep it this way.

Now I look forward, and I want to do a PhD. It is something I do not take lightly, I know how much work it is. I want to pursue it, but I feel scared about what is to come. Will I not be able to handle it? Will I not be able to upkeep a balanced lifestyle? What if I get sick again? That feeling gives me dread and anxiety.

Describing my situation, could someone please give me advice on this? For reference, I live in the Netherlands, so a PhD takes four years and is paid (so the worry of making ends meet is not a concern so to say).",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/15snzta/afraid_to_pursue_a_phd/

1lyjk7k,"Feeling Stuck in My PhD Journey: Struggling Mentally, Seeking Advice (MSCA 2026 Goal)","
Hi everyone,

I’m an Indian PhD scholar in Analytical Chemistry at a public university. The university isn’t well-known and the research facilities are quite average. I continued here for my PhD mostly because I did my MSc here, and my then-supervisor (now PhD guide) encouraged me to stay on. Looking back, I realize that neither the topic nor the institution had much long-term scope. I am his first PhD student, and unfortunately, his lack of experience and academic network has been a major limitation.

So far, I have:
* One paper published in a reputed journal in analytical chemistry.
* A second paper (in a medium-tier journal) is under review. (Unsure about acceptance)
* 2 second-author publication, 1 first author publication, a mini review, and a book chapter - none of them particularly significant.

My goal is to apply for the Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA) in 2026. I’m in early conversations with a potential host lab. To be eligible, I need to defend my PhD thesis by September 2026, which means I must finish all experiments by the end of this year (2025). 

The problem is, I’m burnt out.
I’ve been working very hard, but just last week, even my backup research idea failed and can’t be published. I don’t have strong new ideas,  and I don't know if anything would work.

On top of that, my mental health has taken a major hit.
My boyfriend moved to Europe for his PhD about four months ago. Two days before he left, my second paper was rejected ( resubmitted now). Our long-term plan was that I would join him in Europe after my PhD for a postdoc. But with the stress of the relationship, isolation, academic pressure, and research failures piling up, I feel emotionally and physically exhausted. I was prescribed medication yesterday for burnout and anxiety, but I'm unsure of whether to take them.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for, but maybe:

*If someone here has experience with MSCA, would you be willing to look at my profile and give honest feedback on whether I’m a realistic candidate?

*Also, anyone in the field of analytical chemistry know if two papers is generally enough to submit a thesis, assuming university rules are met. And whether or not it will hugely impact my future.

* Honestly, I know the situation is bad to get post-docs right now, but any positive news would help.

Edit: I've just completed my third year, and my current goal would mean finishing at the begining of 5th year. This may seem unrealistic in Indian Scenario, but there is no way emotionally I can wait another year.

I'm also suffering from autistic burnout and more health issues (physical and mental) to where I've only worked 10-20 hours per week and moved back in with my parents (in a state adjacent to my PhD program) to finish my dissertation remotely.

After all of the recent confusion about whether I passed my dissertation defense, I did end up passing with revisions. I had the same thing happen in my Master's program with my thesis, which ended up delaying my graduation to December 2020 since the revisions were that dense (fortunately, this let my Master's be accepted in full for my PhD program). I'm not sure if there's going to be a graduation delay here, but I won't be shocked if that was the case at all.

Anyway, I feel like this result was a failure again, similar to how I felt when I passed with revisions back in July 2020 for my Master's thesis. I also have my advisor's handwritten notes that he sent me as well and I can barely understand some of what he wrote at all and I won't know until tomorrow what the rest of my committee wants. 

For the past 2 or so years since I've been active on academic subreddits, I wished I pursued being a clinical research coordinator or something where I can do routine work without having to worry about leadership or anything. This whole dissertation result just makes my thoughts this path wasn't for me that much worse. I might give this another day before I revise maybe, but idk honestly.

I need three manuscripts, a general introduction, and a general discussion in my thesis and by the end of April I had two manuscripts done with a third that still needed data analysis and writing. I genuinely didn’t think I would be able to finish at the end of June and end of July also seemed like a stretch. I spoke with my advisor who generously gave me an extra month.

The chances of failure were one in a million. There had not been a failure of a defense in 50 years at my university. Yet, I convinced myself I would be the exception. Everyone says you’re the expert in your topic and I did not believe that either. I practiced my presentation 2-3 times per day and re-read my papers until the day before.

How can I cope?,"I'm (31M) a 5th year PhD student who should be graduating in May assuming that I pass my defense next Friday. I'm posting now because I'm incredibly anxious right now. On the upside, I have a full Powerpoint slide deck officially. However, my advisor is being vague again (as usual) about changes he wants, which I'll clarify during my meeting with him this Friday.

I'm anxiety ridden right now and it's sapping my energy and focus (as usual). I'm probably going to get medication (proponanol, iirc) during a follow up appointment from my PCP in the middle of next week to help, but I'm not sure if that'll be enough at all. What I'm currently afraid of is that there will be some many changes to my presentation before I defend that I won't have enough time to practice for the 8-10 hours I need to remember all of my lines and get my voice under control as much as I can. Many who know me are aware that I don't fake confidence at all or pretend that I know something I don't at all. That'll come out probably during the presentation due to the format of it (not that I don't know the content necessarily) and be a ding against me.

What could I do at this point to try and help myself? I'm considering postponing my defense since I feel like I'll probably fail the oral portion of it.

I should note some things as well: 1.) I'm going to watch as many PhD defenses on YouTube to get an understanding of what I could do as well (even though they're hard to find since they're not legally recordable in a lot of states).

2.) I haven't wrote questions I'm anticipating ahead of time quite yet. I definitely want to do so though.

3.) I have no issue with presenting itself. It's just awful for me that all of these changes requested of me and all of this prep is seemingly happening at the last second. Back when I was a full time instructor, I disliked having a workload so big that I never had time to practice presenting at all. I realize me working 10-20 hours per week this academic year wasn't helpful either, but that's the true limit on the hours I can focus before autistic burnout and more kicks in.

While I know most are in jest, I felt compelled to share some comfort. Hopefully put some perspective on the current situation. In some ways, the same challenges of finding a job are amplified at every stage of your career.

I don’t have everything figured but some of my reflections:

1. Careers are longer than you think and cyclical. You will have good and bad years. It is extremely unlucky to start your career during hard years, but the resilience will pay off in dividends.

2. I am firmly optimistic that CS is the best major to graduate with in this moment in time. I’m optimistic that in the long-term, AI will amplify the amount of software in the world. There will be more code to maintain. Knowing how to code will be like speaking the language of the world. If you choose to pivot out of engineering (into say product management), you will also never have the insecurity of not being technical.

3. It’s not your first job that counts. You don’t need to FAANG or bust. Even companies like John Deere needs strong cs engineers. Careers are long. Also FAANG folks are equally miserable in their own way, because of all the bureaucratic red-tap to make a code change. Focus on finding a role where you’ll thrive and be happy—it’s worth more than an extra 20% in salary. 

4. While persistence is key. In markets like these, sometimes take smaller steps. Have a reality check with your financial situation and balance it with your goals. Don’t settle, but also do what you need to do. FWIW, it really does feel like a good time to be a founder again.

Some tips for recruiting.

1. Application burnout is real. Don’t be afraid to take a week off and just explore. Read cool papers, linkedin shit-post articles, play around with different tools. Build cool stuff for fun.

2. Have a blurb ready about yourself. Ready to copy-paste at all times. Don’t overthink or hesitate to ask people to forward it to hiring managers. The opportunity cost for somebody to shoot you a referral is essentially zero, especially compared to the potential upside. Anyone who makes you feel weird about self-promotion doesn't get it—and probably isn't humble enough to recognize they might need the same help in the future.

I’m proud of you. It’s hard. Truly. And it’s unfair. But you will be fine. I promise. And you’ll look back at it with kinder eyes. My DMs are open if anybody just needs somebody to chat with.

Two quotes I keep coming back to

* No amount of prestige can buy confidence.
* Confidence comes from enduring failure, not stacking successes.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1h6vgap/reflections_and_advice_from_a_10year_cs_alum/
111auoo,Why is there no universal platform to rate your graduate research program experience?,"Hello guys,

I am a European student enrolled in a PhD program in Canada. I am about to graduate, and the four and a half years I've spent working on my research program were the most traumatizing and challenging years of my life. The challenges were caused mainly by a precarious financial situation and burnout, as well as by a total lack of support, intellectual stimulation, and scientific guidance from my research director and the PI. I feel exploited and want others not to fall into the trap that somebody should have warned me about. I think all this could have been easily avoided, had there been a universal platform where graduate students could freely exchange practical information about their program and share their experiences. I prepared a little immersive scenario, if you want to get to the details of the idea, scroll down to the conclusion section.

**Before the enrollment:**

You've just got accepted for a project of your dreams. You already see yourself adorned with a graduate cap and robe, holding proudly your well-deserved diploma. Finally, it is your chance to prove yourself, dive deeply into your own innovative scientific project; meet like-minded researchers and gain access to the international scientific community. You're done with the university inscription and the immigration procedures - all ready to go. What can go wrong?

Everything. Graduate students, especially foreigners, are utterly vulnerable and dependent on their research director/PI before, during, and after the program. It's hard to comprehend to what extent before one finds themselves in the position of a graduate student. Before enrolling in the program and joining the research team, we rarely have access to the testimonies of former graduates. If we luckily get in touch with them, they are often the ones chosen by the director/PI. Our whole future career is in the hands of the director/PI, and being all enthusiastic and full of optimism PhD candidates - we usually won't risk our freshly-gained acceptance for the thesis by pushing too much in the search for a second opinion.

**During the enrollment**:

Let’s say it is going not-so-well. You find yourself far away from home, with no support network, and in financial dire straits. You are left alone with the project with nobody to guide you. The only interaction you have with your director/PI consists of submitting monthly reports, and you feel that you're nothing but cheap labor in their eyes. You start to accumulate grudges and contempt for your supervisors, but you won't dare to search for help at the university. Besides, what can they do? Everybody knows that a thesis is a struggle, it's normal. The time passes, the project does not advance very well, and you struggle with motivation. Even without paying the tuition fees, you’re way below the poverty line - you must work part-time along with your thesis. You’re exhausted, but you persist anyway. You’ve spent too much time working on the project, it’s too late to give it up. You see your friends travel, buy their first house, start a family, and have well-paid jobs.

Your whole life during graduate studies depends on your research director/PI. It's them who oversee your funding, it's them who will provide you with the documents necessary to prolong your student visa (if you require one). It's they who can make the thesis either an opportunity for growth or a living hell. Research directors/PI can exert their power over graduate students with total impunity. No university (especially a paid North American university) will intervene if the graduate experience is not satisfying for the students, yet the research team still generates diplomaed doctors. No university will risk its reputation or the participation of a renowned researcher in a graduate program for the sake of a student's well-being. Quitting is always an option, but one would have to explain the hell of a long gap in the CV, as well as justify to oneself the long months of exploitation endured. Many of us hope to graduate soon, oblivious or kidding ourselves about the unpredictability of a scientific project, which can take long years to develop. For many of us, a thesis in a foreign country is a chance to enter the world of international research, would be a pity to mess that up, right?

**After graduation**: You finally got your diploma. You managed. Was it worth the struggle? Did it prepare you to enter the job market and find a post that will compensate you according to your expertise and all the years spent studying? Looks like the best you can opt for is a post-doc. It seems like after at least ten years of studies you still need an ''internship'' to refine your competencies. You'd gladly move on and forget about those years spent working on the thesis, but wait

...you need your research director's reference letter to get a job.

**Conclusion**: Why is it just us, the students, who need the reference letters? What if the research directors needed to prove that they are apt to guide the students along the thesis before they enroll a new student? Or at least, we, the students, should have the possibility to take conscious decisions on what we are putting ourselves in before we start a long-term engagement in a research team.

**The information gap must disappear.**

**The exploitation of graduate students must stop.**

We need an international platform where each research graduate’s experience would be rated, and the information would be freely available to the student community. Graduate students suffer all around the world. This platform will be certainly filled with complaints and warning signs, but we must not forget to acknowledge and share our experiences with amazing mentors who inspired us to pursue a career in research in the first place.

Science-hub changed the dynamics of access to knowledge. We need to do the same with graduate studies - to take away the power from the ones who monopolize it and wield it to our advantage. I propose an idea to create a platform inspired by Glassdor-like websites. We can call it a ‘’PhDeal’’. Specify your university, specify your program, and name your research director. Then, anonymously, share the information about:

1cwrbyq,Anyone leave their PhD late in the game?,"country: US 

I am at end of year 4 our of 5 in my STEM PhD program. I am deciding whether staying is worth it. This is my list below summarizing some key facts: 

1. I no longer want to be in academia. I went straight from undergrad to grad school. My only ""work"" experience is in my PhD

2. I don't want to regret the last 4 years, plus get no recognition for the sacrifice of the PhD (the program only allows you to receive a masters if you complete the PhD). The masters program that would not require defending a masters thesis requires classes that PhD students wouldn't commonly take. 

3. The relationship with my PhD is driving my to burnout. She doesnt have time to be involved with projects (typical of PhD) but wants to micromanage. This results in  responses in what could be categorized as abusive to issues she creates (eg refuses to read early stage documents but says she agrees etc.). The biggest issues is that with all people in my lab she has had this cyclical issue of exploding and crossing boundaries that we previously set up for better working relationships. Then she apologizes and comes up with new ""working policies"" that only last until she is stressed again. 

4. At this point I am having physiological responses to working on my project. Feeling nauseous when going to work. I get shaky when i get a Microsoft teams message in fear of what shes going to say. I feel I definitely am experiencing burnout - fatigue, feeling unable to do normal activities (eg social time, cooking, eating etc).

My concerns:

1. My PI is my only letter of rec. post undergrad and now I am 4 years our of undergrad. If I applied for jobs now in something like data analyst etc. - would this be risky if she is upset that I leave

2. Financially a leave of absence would be difficult. I am not living with a partner or someone who  could cover rent + expenses. Having only made a PhD salary my savings couldn't withstand a full leave of absence. I am uncertain whether taking a leave of absence just to work all the time doing something like instacart would allow me to recover. 

3. Losing 4 years of work - there would be no degree that I would obtain from this experience

4. Job opportunities - is there an increased difficulty to obtain a job with what looks like a 4 year work gap but was a pHD.

Any experiences or thoughts welcome - thanks!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1cwrbyq/anyone_leave_their_phd_late_in_the_game/
1kiufn2,Considering dropping out,"First things first, please be kind and constructive- I'm feeling pretty low about myself and the situation I've gotten myself into. Also apologies in advance for what will likely be a long and jumbled post. I will also preface this by saying that I know doubt is common during a PhD, but I feel this might be more serious.

I won't give away too many personal details, but I am 1.5 years into a 4 year PhD program at a well-regarded university in the UK. My PhD is in a field of engineering.

I went straight from my undergrad + masters into my PhD (despite fears of burnout) as I got a funded offer to do a PhD in a field I am passionate about and with a topic that seemed (at the time) like something I would be incredibly interested in. I have always had in my head that I wanted to do a PhD and then go into industry, so this seemed perfect.

However, I am nearly 2 years in and I am stuck. I have nothing to show for my work so far (apart from one conference paper riddled with mistakes and little to no valuable content). The project set up I have been working on for months is barely anywhere near completion. And there is so much work to complete in the next two years, and given my current skills I will not manage it. I am also not sure that my planned work is even enough to justify obtaining a PhD.

I have been on a research trip for the past few months, which was supposed to give me results that would form a good chunk of my thesis. However, nothing has gone to plan and I feel that I when I return home in a month I will have nothing to show for this trip, despite expectations from my supervisor and advisor.

I am not sure I have the right skills for this project, or even a PhD in general. And I'm not sure I even enjoy the specifics of my project. My project is on a much more theoretical and abstract area in my field, whereas I am slowly realising how much I would rather be doing something more applied (and useful). This project requires a lot of coding knowledge that I do not have, and I feel I lack so much basic understanding of this field compared to my peers of similar level to me. Coming up with research ideas and then explaining the results does not come naturally to me at all. My brain just feels completely blank and empty. My attention span has also deteriorated so much that I am struggling to do any work effectively, even if I have the skills to do it. 

I have always suffered with anxiety and self-doubt so it is hard to tell whether this panic/crisis is justified or not. During every set of exams I have taken there was usually at least one phone call to my family where I was having a panic attack convinced that I was going to fail for one reason or another. I then ended up passing (usually because I worked hard to prevent that from happening). Because of this, my family have stopped being so supportive when I experience stress like this. Any time I have expressed worry about my PhD, they laugh and say that they have heard that many times before and it'll be fine as always. They don't seem to understand that this is a completely different scenario. By reading lecture notes enough and completing enough past papers, I can get good enough to pass an exam. No amount of reading and cramming can give me the fundamental research skills needed for a PhD. I have stopped telling my family about my concerns because of this.

Because of all this, I am considering whether it is worth my time and effort to continue. This PhD has been the best experience of my life- I have met so many incredible people and I have grown a lot as a person. But I fear it may be better to quit now and try and apply for jobs in my industry. Despite not enjoying my project, I still love my field, which is partly why I am so sad about struggling in something I am so passionate about.

I haven't discussed my fears with my supervisor yet. He is a very supportive supervisor and we meet frequently. He is aware of my doubts about my research trip, but he feels optimistic that it will work out. He also tells me he is happy with my general progress, but I am not sure he quite understands the extent of my lack of knowledge or faith in my project.

If I do decide that I will drop out, I have no idea how to explain my situation to future employers, and what to put on my CV. It would hardly look good to employers that I gave up, right? I am also concerned about my lack of experience. I have no internship experience as I spent my summers during undergrad waitressing so I could afford my living costs while at uni. I'm not sure a PhD drop out with zero experience is a particularly desirable hire.

I am incredibly stressed and I have no idea what the right thing to do is. I feel burnt out and I lack the skills and passion to continue.

Any advice from anyone (particularly those who have gone through something similar) would be greatly appreciated!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1kiufn2/considering_dropping_out/
1e8sbwa,Help me choose my specialty,"Starting third year and have been struggling with this question a lot recently so thought I would outsource advice.

  
Likes:

-Decent lifestyle (family is #1 priority, I also want to have time to enjoy interests like hiking, traveling, outdoors)

-Direct, immediate impact (after X intervention, prescription, procedure, patient feels better)

-Hands-on medicine (whether procedural, just being on my feet, or having really good physical exam skills)

-Variety (I have ADHD, which also is the reason for the previous two bullets)

-Having a good general medical knowledge base (I enjoy being able to help family and friends. No one in my family is even close to the medical field)

-Medium to high salary (obviously not the most important but I come from a poor background and I would much rather not have to worry) (also interested in living on the west coast)

-Patient interaction

-Interesting physiology

-Teaching

-Clinic

-Diagnosing (The undifferentiated patient is really exciting, so would miss this a little if I became super specialized)

Dislikes:

-Toxic work environment, egotistic personalities

-Charting/paperwork

-Super long rounds (not a huge deal)

-Research (not totally against it but this would be a very small component of my career if any)

  
Specialties I've considered:

EM: Obvious choice, pretty much hits everything on my list. I also really enjoyed my EM rotation. However, I'm not sure how I would put up with the night shifts and irregular schedule long term. I feel like I'm prone to burnout and I know EM has the highest rates. I wonder about maybe transitioning to an office job later in my career (medical director of a national park or something would be a dream).  Otherwise, I did really love learning to put in IVs, doing CPR, suturing, etc, but I worry that all of the trauma exposure would build up over time (I usually feel what others feel pretty strongly, like any time a patient cries I have to fight hard not to also cry). 

IM/Cardiology: Would give me the general knowledge base I'm looking for. I love cardiac physiology and it was by far my best pre-clincial grade. I also feel like I would get a deeper understanding of diseases and treatment vs. EM. Still curious about things like Onc/ID/Endo. Would give me more time to decide. But, my IM rotation didn't blow me away. I thought it was cool and I learned a ton, but I felt like the amount of time I actually spent with patients was fairly low, and early rounds + afternoons of charting drained me. Would be willing to push through IM residency if it meant a better subspecialty and honestly being a PCP is not out of the question. 

Derm: Have a decent bit of derm research and the lifestyle, procedural possibilities, plus great outcomes and patient satisfaction makes this fairly appealing. Would miss the general knowledge but maybe a prelim year would be enough/it would be cool to do consults and get involved in inpatient derm to see a variety of medical problems with derm manifestations.

Surgery (Ortho/ENT): Haven't had surgery yet but I shadowed ortho at the start of med school because I thought I wanted to do that and even the ""nice"" surgeons getting pissed in the OR really stressed me out.  I loved anatomy and something like Ortho would be the ultimate hands-on I'm looking for but the lifestyle doesn't excite me and the general medical knowledge is iffy. 

Other considerations: I'm pretty much against doing a research year. Luckily, my school matches extremely well so I think given that I'm not pressed for top academic programs means I could probably get into most specialties. I'm also open to the idea of backup applying. 

I'm normally not an indecisive person but I feel so stuck and worried about picking something, regretting it, and then not having the life I'm looking for. Having a lifestyle specialty is important but I also worry about resenting every day in a field I'm not passionate about. When I was younger, I worked a couple of shitty jobs and it was the worst feeling ever  knowing I had to work the next day in a job I didn't like and a toxic environment.

1lrqif4,"I'm losing hope because of Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill""","I just turned 20 in may. The same month I moved to Texas from Alabama because I was kicked out and living in my car. I came here to Texas to live with my ex-stepfather but it will not work long term whatsoever. I haven't gotten a job yet, I'm constantly rejected from the most menial of positions.

I'm still constantly applying, and if it comes to it I'll just work for the minimum wage, but here is my issue.

My reason for coming here at all was to try and get into a University here and either enter a study abroad program, or outright attend a foreign university.

I got myself into a community college, and my gpa is a 3.6 so far after two semesters.

But now, with Trump's Bill, I do not think I can afford any University here in Texas. I rely on snap benefits, and I'm facing homelessness. My dream of going overseas is becoming less of a dream and more of a desperate escape plan. But the goal was always to use my community college gpa to get into a University here, and then use my gpa there to get into a University overseas.

I have no set choice, I've been casually researching Germany only because I am most familiar with it.

But Germany doesn't acknowledge community college credits(I don't know if they'd care about my gpa either) and I doubt many other countries do.

My high school gpa is a 2.1 because my mother forced me out of school constantly because of her own beliefs and so I barely graduated. I thought I'd finally gotten past this, I knew it wouldn't be easy, but now it seems impossible.

If I can't afford university here, or snap is taken away, or I'm homeless again and the shelters lose funding. All I can think of is to drop out of community college and go to trade school.

But I don't want to live like this, I was kicked out because I want to pursue forensic science, and I stood my ground to achieve this. It feels like everything is working against me.

I am genuinely so lost. I'm trying to have a better future for my sister, to pave the way so she has a easy road to follow. But i'm caught in thorns and I feel like all she'll find is my corpse. How is she going to succeed if I can't?

I started learning German because its the least I can do, but I'll make it clear I am not set on Germany. The UK, Netherlands, etc seem fine to me. I'm sure the international aspects are better for other subs but I'm asking what am I meant to do now?

Is community college worth it anymore? Should I even try to go to a university here or should I take off for another country and then work my way up to an education there?

I feel like I'm running out of time, that if I don't do something I'm going to be poor and miserable just like everyone else in my family.

Originally I was going to have a 3 month stay in different European countries next year as soon as my passport is prepared, to see if I even like that environment/the culture, but now I don't know if I can even afford that or if I should just be jumping head first.

I feel like I've been born too late, I didn't have enough time to prove myself valuable with school so no country would see me as a priority. I know I am far from the only one attempting to leave the US. I hoped I could attend a school here long enough to make myself just valuable enough, but now I just don't think its possible when I only have so much in savings.

If I could get organized enough to figure out what I'm meant to be doing then I can do more research on my own, but now I'm overwhelmed and lost.

  
Edit: I am not expecting miracles! I will work as hard as I have to, and I know that Europe isn't a magical land of success. I want to get out of poverty no matter where I am, and now it seems that an education here won't do it unless I follow the same path my father and his father did, which didn't work.

Please give me the benefit of the doubt. I am young and naïve about a lot of things, but I know running to another country won't magically fix all my problems at the very least. I just want to understand the correct and most logical steps to take while working for this.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lrqif4/im_losing_hope_because_of_trumps_big_beautiful/

1kn0a6v,PhDs are inherently unfair,"Let's say you have two equally talented students:

The first student is part of a productive research group with an engaged supervisor and regular meetings.  They are able to join in with their group and collaborate on a number of projects, learning skills from others and being a coauthor on a number of papers.  Their supervisor thoroughly checks their work and they have a mentor to learn best practices in academia.

The second student is working on a project separate from the expertise of their department and has to self teach everything in the field.  They make a number of mistakes along the way with no one to point them out beforehand.  They have far more restricted opportunities to collaborate since they are working on a project with near zero literature on it.  The supervisor disappears for weeks on end and their department is dpartment is disengaged and can't be bothered with them.  They produce work that isn't read by their supervisor and hence make more mistakes along the way.  

The first student finishes their PhD with a number of highly cited works while the second only produces a couple of papers.  The work produced by the first student has far more input from their supervisor, whereas the entirety of the second students work is their own intellectual effort with ZERO guidance from their supervisor. 

Who is the better student?  Really struggling with this as my journey was the second students, and I feel nothing but anger and envy at the students who experienced what the first student did.

But it's immediately been an utterly humbling experience. The speed at which he works and the incredible depth of his understanding... it's just like nothing I've ever seen before. I've never gotten this kind of quality feedback from my colleagues or even my supervisor. I feel utterly intellectually inferior for the first time in my life. This is my first real glimpse at the kind of skills it takes to be at the very top and it makes me angry at myself for having become too comfortable and lazy.

I should commit 100% of my time and energy to this project. This is the most important opportunity of my academic life. But instead, I'm just utterly frozen. I'm staring at a wall of feedback and just can't find the courage to work through it all. The comments are not harsh (at least from what I have read so far), it's just highly focused and no bullshit. I'm terrified that I am going to screw this up. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy: my fear of failure is actually going to lead to me failing. If I screw this up, I will take this as a sign that academia is not for me. How do I get over this freeze response and start working?

143xb7p,"Dismissed from medical school, I need advice please.","Hello, US ex- medical student here. 

I really love medicine and I am pretty devastated that this is probably the end for.
Unfortunately, I was just few decimal away from passing my last term of 1st year, but the school is very strict and said I have failed. There is no remediation and I will be dismissed. 


I am actually on a repeat year because I went on leave of absence last year due to mental health issues. I was passing all my classes until two months ago, my grade plummeted badly. This is when I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder (on top of already existing PTSD and anxiety)  which I believe contributed a lot on why I struggled. Now I am unsure what I should go for and what would be a good plan B. 


I am pretty lost now.. I'd really like some advice on what would be an alternative to medical school. I really love medicine, and I am in tears. I definitely love the medical field and just STEM in general. I considered Physician assistant, but seems like many programs are really particular about their requirements, which I don't have because I graduated undergrad long time ago.


One of my friend did suggest that maybe I should reapply to another school (but I doubt anyone wants me with my F) or at least go to a Caribbean medical school. I am already in so much debt and I know how cutthroat Caribbean medschools are, so I don't think it's a good idea.

I know I do not want to go for teaching or research because I've done them before medical school and didn't like it. 
All I have is a bachelor degree in Biology. If you have any advice or suggestion on other careers in STEM that would be good for someone who likes medicine, I'd really appreciate it..!

EDIT: Hello everyone. Firstly, thank you for your response. I was overwhelmed by how many encouraging messages I've received here. It's been difficult, but all your responses gave me hope. I appreciate all the help..!

I ended up doing a request for appeal as my last resort. They still denied giving me a Pass, but thank goodness I was granted a remediation course this summer. I'll do all my best!  If I do fail, I'll accept it and take other career paths to consideration, which many of you had great suggestions. 

Thank you for creating such a supportive community here. I also hope that whatever you guys do, I hope you succeed! Goodbye for now 😊",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/143xb7p/dismissed_from_medical_school_i_need_advice_please/
1jabamw,"How to approach the ""I'm 99% sure you used AI for these assignments"" conversation","**EDIT: Thank you all so much for your suggestions and support — the conversation went very well.  I started with ""given the evidence available to me at this time, I need to proceed with the conclusion that these assignments are AI unless you can prove otherwise.""  She immediately apologized, explained feeling overwhelmed by some items, and thanked me (!) for giving her 0s on those assignments but not a 0 in the entire class.  Very gracious conversation, over in 3 minutes flat.**

The TA for my Abnormal Psychology class reached out recently about a student's short writing exercises that look fucky.  I agree with him; the writing is weirdly formal, has excessive adjectives, and does the thing with bolded headings before bullet points that screams LLM to me.  I dropped the three responses into a detector and it popped out >90% probability of AI.  I emailed the student to ask to meet about her recent assignments, and she agreed to meet tomorrow.

During that meeting, what do I say?  I've had students look me in the eye and deny everything in the face of stronger proof than this.  I've had a previous student file a complaint (thankfully dismissed) against me after a past conversation last semester that went approximately:

>Past Me: This response isn't at all like your other work. \[shows samples\]

>Past Student: I have no idea what you're talking about.

>Past Me: This, this, and this are in line with the way ChatGPT formats responses.

>Past Student: I had no idea ChatGPT did it that way when I chose to format my response like that.

>Me: Okay, in that case please just explain your response to me.

>Student: I'd have to see it.

>Me: The prompt was \[repeats prompt\].  Why did you write what you did?

>Student: I don't remember.

>Me: That's a problem, that you don't remember.  It's also a problem that this software notes your response is more likely to be generated by an AI than a human.

>Student: I heard those are unreliable.  Anyway, there's nothing in the syllabus that says I have to remember what I wrote for past assignments.  I have another meeting, so I'm going to leave now.

So what the fuck do I do during this upcoming conversation to avoid a repeat of the same nonsense?  I'm teaching future therapists here; it fucking well matters to me that I not let people lazy enough to cheat on 3-point homework assignments become therapists to vulnerable clients someday.

1jt0dqy,Sexually harrassed by a well-established professor i have been actively collaborating together,"*disclaimer: contains topics of sexual harrassment below

I’m a PhD student (Female, late 20s) and for the past couple of years, I’ve been collaborating closely with a lab outside of my own university. The head of that lab is a very well-known, established professor, a legendary figure in my field. Our research interests are very aligned, and we’ve been working on multiple projects together. I had planned to continue collaborating with him and his lab even after my PhD (he offered a postdoc if I cannot get a faculty position right away), and he was also supposed to give recommendation letters…

He’s based in another country, so we mostly worked online, but we would meet in person 2–3 times a year — at conferences or during short research visits. A year ago, when we were saying goodbye, he gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek. I felt weird about it, but I tried to brush it off as something cultural/casual (like a “bijou” kiss but given where he is from & been living, it could not have been “cultural”) and didn’t want to think much more of it, especially since he’s much older (almost 40 years older). 

But just a few days ago, something happened that made it clear this wasn’t innocent. I saw him again after several months. When we said goodbye, he hugged me — but this time he kissed me multiple times on both cheeks in a way that felt too close, too deliberate and uncomfortable. Then he looked at me and asked “Can I kiss you?” I froze. I was already panicking inside, so I just said, “on the cheek,” and that was it. But I keep thinking, why would he ask to kiss me on the cheek after already doing it multiple times without asking… 

Earlier that same day, we were sharing a cab ride and he held my hands the entire time. I was too shocked and uncomfortable to react. Now I keep having flashbacks of past interactions and realizing how many red flags I might have ignored or brushed off because I trusted him as a mentor, or because I didn’t want to jeopardize the collaboration.

Since then, I’ve been thinking what to do and I’ve decided that I need to withdraw from the collaboration completely and cut ties with him and his lab… I don’t think I have the courage (at least yet) to report him, and I think it will only hurt me than him. But I know for sure that I can’t work with him again after what happened… 

What hurts is that this decision also means walking away from years of work, future projects I was excited about, and potentially strong recommendation letters and connections that could have really helped my career. It feels like I’m being punished for his actions, that not only was I violated and made me feel so shit and horrible, but I now have to give up so much because of it. I liked the other collaborators that were in the projects together but I now have to walk away from all that as well…

I feel angry, sad and very confused. I keep questioning what really happened and what I should do next. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you cope with the injustice of not only being harassed, but also losing opportunities because of it? 

Am I making the “right” decision by withdrawing myself from all the projects and my ties with the one of the most well established lab? (I am thinking about doing this without direct confrontations; he will immediately know why and wouldnt ask, I think). 

I haven’t had anywhere else to talk about this yet, and since it only happened a few days ago, things still feel messy and hard to process... I didn’t include all the smaller details as I’m still trying to make sense of everything, but I just really wanted to get some advice as soon as possible…. Thank you so much for reading my long post.

------------------ follow-up 

I wanted to reply to each commenter individually, but I noticed there are so many of you, so I thought it’d be easier to respond this way. 

First of all, thank you so much for the support, encouragement, and helpful suggestions... I especially appreciate those of you who validated that this entire situation was absolutely inappropriate. It was also heartbreaking to hear that quite a few people have experienced similar things.

I noticed that many of you asked similar questions, so I wanted to clarify a few points: 

- Relationship with my PhD advisor & the professor

My main PhD advisor is not involved in these collaborations. He’s fully aware that I’ve been collaborating with this other lab, but the collaboration doesn’t directly contribute to my PhD thesis. That said, he definitely knows who this professor is (everyone in the field does — he’s a legendary figure) and was very supportive when I first established the collaboration.

Since this work isn’t directly tied to my thesis, my PhD advisor has never been involved in any of the joint projects. In that sense, it’s a relief that I can just “walk away” from this situation without needing to explain much, and my advisor likely won’t ask too many questions (That said, I am not sure whether I feel comfortable telling my PhD advisor what happened (in 40s, Male), I feel like he won't do anything about it (maybe he will be ""scared"" to do something because the person is way too senior and legendary), and I will be just left alone anyway...) 

Also, thankfully, cutting ties with him won’t affect the completion of my PhD, a huge silverling of this whole thing...  It can hurt my future job prospects, especially since I’ll be stepping away from several promising projects/publications and he has a strong influence in the country where I’m hoping to work. He was also supposed to write me recommendation letters that are due very soon, but I no longer feel comfortable receiving them. So while this still has consequences on my career and the years of work I've done in his lab, but it doesn’t directly impact my PhD... 

- Consulting the university’s sexual harassment or relevant support team

I noticed many of you suggested I should seek advice at the university. But since I’m at a different university than he is, I’m not sure which university I should contact. I do have an official collaborative status at his institution as well, but I’m uncertain what would happen if I reached out. Would it escalate things? Are these completely confidential? What kinds of support do they usually provide? 

Right now, what I really need is guidance on how to move forward and think through my next steps strategically. For example, I’ll definitely keep seeing him at academic conferences — what should I do then? How do I withdraw from our ongoing projects? What do I tell the other collaborators about dropping out? Etc… In fact, I have a conference coming up very soon that he will be attending as well. I am thinking of canceling the whole trip to avoid him, especially because it just happened and I am not sure if it’s safe to meet him so soon, but is it the right decision for me to cancel? All of these things… still not sure how to proceed. 

- Potential of other victims / Testing the waters with his other female students 

About a year ago, when I first started feeling uncomfortable, I tried to subtly test the waters with a couple of his female students — one former and one current. One of them had been working with him for over 10 years and seemed like someone I could trust. I brought it up lightly, I was careful and vague, but I think she understood what I was hinting at. She said he’s not like that and seemed pretty confident. The others I spoke to also said similar things (around 3-4 of them said they had never seen or heard anything inappropriate about him in that way). 

So it actually helped me lower my guards down even when things already felt “off.” For instance, at a conference around a year ago, we were finishing writing up a paper in the lobby of the conference hotel (deadline was in a few days), and he asked me to come up to his room to continue working, and I felt weird and uncomfortable, I wanted to say no, but I brushed off that nothing would happen. Also, the way he asked made it seem like a casual, practical thing, nothing weird, and I didn't feel like I had room to say ""no"" without making it awkward. Really luckily, nothing happened, we just worked for a bit and that was it.

The same kind of situation happened again this time. He invited me up again (this was the day before the kissing and hand-holding). I had recently had dinner with his wife and kids a few times, so I didn’t think much of it. It still made me uncomfortable — just the idea of going up to someone’s hotel room — but again, I didn’t think anything would happen. Also, like a year ago, it felt hard to say “no” because of how casually he framed it.

Luckily, again, nothing happened, we just finished talking about work. But the next day, he told me we should watch a “movie” the next time we met at a conference in his room. That immediately gave me chills, and I suddenly knew his intentions weren’t innocent... That same day, the hand-holding and the “Can I kiss you?” happened. 
I know this sounds so obvious written down and incredibly naive and I completely see it now. But at the time, I truly believed he was someone I could trust, especially after hearing reassurance from his female students, meeting his family multiple times, and his wife had been in constant contact with me recently (nothing inappropriate — just questions related to my previous job as she’s going through something similar). All of that made him seem safe and trustworthy.

I also know this is exactly the kind of story people use to blame women — questioning why she went to his room in the first place, or saying she “let it happen.” And honestly, reading it now, I get why it sounds naive and irresponsible. But in that moment, I truly didn’t think anything would happen. It felt unusual but I didn’t see it that way... 

Just like many of you have said, it’s hard for me to believe I’m the “first.” But based on what his female students said, there doesn’t seem to be any known history of this kind of behavior… Or maybe there is, and they just didn’t know. I’m really not sure. 

For the record, I haven’t told any of his former/current students what happened, and I don’t plan to, as of now. They’re still working closely with him, and their relationship with him is much longer and deeper than mine. I’ve thought about saying something, partly to protect them and also since they would ask why I am withdrawing all of a sudden, but based on what I’ve seen and heard, I don’t think they’re at the same kind of risk. Also, I am an ""outsider"" to the lab as I am a collaborator, whereas they had been working with him for much longer and see him almost every day. I just don’t feel comfortable sharing something like this with people so closely tied to him. I am not sure how the story would be received or how it might spread. I can imagine him finding out that I had been ""talking"" and flipping the narrative to protect himself and completely ""destroy"" my career. Maybe I'm overthinking, as it feels all very messy still, I don’t know... 

I’m not sure how much of this extra information is helpful, but I tried to clarify since so many of you were asking. I’m really, really grateful to everyone who took the time to offer support and advice… Thank you so much.

---- P.S. To those of you who suggested I should escalate and report — I completely agree with you. I really do want to. As a woman, I want to do what I can to protect others and make sure he faces the consequences he deserves. But the truth is… this only happened a few days ago, and I’m still completely overwhelmed. I feel terrible every minute, constantly having flashbacks, and I’m trying to process everything and figure out what I can even begin to do. On top of that, he’s been constantly messaging me (nothing ""obviously"" inappropriate content), asking why I’ve gone silent, and I don’t even know how to respond. Reporting him definitely feels like the right thing in the long run, but as many of you also said, I need to be mentally ready — and at the moment, I’m just not there yet. One commenter said that I can report when I feel more ready and courageous. That really stayed with me. I truly hope I’ll be able to do it one day. Thank you for saying that — it meant more than you know.

ur3emd,Death of Pathology has been Greatly Overstated,"[Pathology Job Market 5-year history](https://imgur.com/a/Ijp3MyK) per [https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/jobs](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/jobs)

Currently there are over 700 jobs, last May there has been 350 jobs. There was a lot of speculation that pathology job market would boost up after the old-timers retired. A lot of pathologists cling on until their 70s but COVID encouraged alot of pathologists to retire. The job market is probably looked the best in a decade and you guys, medical students, should know about it.

My career has been 35hr/wk and getting 400+ K salary after establishing myself 5 years into my career.

No clinical bullsh\*t. Just do my work. I don’t deal with much bs. I go home happy everyday. My colleagues are nice and kind. I’m grateful for my job. I do less than 8 hours of actual work some days. Usually get to go home at 2 pm just as long as I get the quota done. There are some jobs that are 4 days a week. Pretty sweet if you ask me.

SDN forum has very very few voices in it (honestly it was just 2-3 people ranting), those voices are overwhelmingly people in private practice and very outspoken in their displeasure with the field.

Dozens of all my colleagues and graduating class love the work/life balance pathology offers and consider for the amt of work they put in, they are extremely well reimbursed. Dermatopathology can get you 500+K if you are honestly want to live that luxury lifestyle.

I honestly think radiology gets a lot of love but there’s a lot of overlap with pathology in terms of mentally-stimulating, dealing with zebras, focusing on minutiae details. However, I can honestly say after talking to radiology friends, they work EXTREMELY taxing shifts. 12 overwhelming hours of non-stop grinding at studies where at the end of the day, you just want to curl up into a ball and sleep. Whereas in pathology, while it’s as intellectually satisfying as radiology, I never have felt overwhelmed in my day job and only get annoyed if I haven’t finished past 3pm :P. Almost every radiologist reading is now STAT (due to emergence of PA/NPs) and everything has to read ASAP; a pathologist has way more autonomy!!! A slide can just pushed it back a day if we want to/clinical judgement. Also, unlike radiology where readings are scrutinized by surgery, OBGYN, cardiologists and every field in the blue with one mistake being in record books forever; pathologists really don’t have anyone hovering over their shoulders and scrutinizing their mistakes.

I have tons of leftover energy after work to actively participate in intramural sports on weekdays, practice in a band and cook dinner for my family. I don’t think I would be able to have this extra energy after shifts in rads, EM, hospitalist work or any other specialty who tend to feel drained after shifts. It's honestly not hard to get into it right now, but I can imagine in the next 5-10 years, it'll become more competitive as the secret gets out.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/ur3emd/death_of_pathology_has_been_greatly_overstated/
16aax8x,I can’t take my surgical rotation anymore. I legitimately want to never go again.,"This is my very last rotation and there’s three weeks left. I hate it here. It’s a 3 month rotation, and I’m not sure how I survived this long. I hate scrubbing in. I hate standing in a corner, I hate retracting, I hate suturing, I hate skin gluing, I hate trying to read the room only to be wrong each time (eg, I didn’t grab the bed at the end of a case and resident and scrub tech told me to always automatically grab the bed at the end. Next case I immediately grab the bed as soon as I scrub out, anesthesiology fellow rolls his eyes and says “next time you need to ask before getting the bed, I’ll let it slide this time.”) I hate “managing” floor patients ie doing one dressing change and being told I need to practice more as if I have 20 wounds at home I can practice on.

Im tired of the co-student kissing everyone’s ass. Im tired of the sub-I pimping me on rounds. I can’t be told I “need to look more energized in the OR” as I watch the surgeon inset another G-tube while he yells at me as I drive the camera no one ever trained me on (and no it’s not intuitive).

I’m not doing well on UWorld. There’s an oral exam we take too and I’m overwhelmed by the 100 page prep book they gave us that’s all “fair game.”

I’m not cut out for this. Everyone tells me I need to learn how to do things I hate in residency, so maybe I’m not cut out for medicine. Even my worst days on IM were better than my average days here. I want to skip the next three weeks but I know I’ll fail obviously if I do.

1608sm3,Cried and hyperventilated in the middle of my first graduate school class.,"I just started my graduate program this week. I have a research assistant position which pays my tuition, I am also the president of a club on campus relating to my field. Last night I attended my 3 hour seminar class. In the middle of class I started to feel weepy. I’m just really overwhelmed with my workload. I tried to hide it and did some breathing to try and calm down but it did not work. The professor asked me to share something and I just broke down in tears in the middle of my class (there’s only 6 students in it). I then started having a panic attack and had to leave the room to calm down. I thought I had calmed down and went back to the class…but I was dead wrong. I was just sitting in class trying to hide the sound of my sobs. I am so embarrassed and humiliated. I don’t know how I am ever going to show my face to my professor/classmates ever again. Not to mention I am the only person enrolled in my specific graduate program. I have no cohort to support me. I feel so alone. I don’t know if I can do this. What kind of adult breaks down in tears in the middle of a class. How can I come back from this?

Edit/Update: I just want to thank everyone for the kind words of encouragement. I thought I was just yelling into the void. I didn’t expect that this many people would give up their time (I know how valuable that time is) to comment advice and words of support. I did reach out to my professor and they responded very kindly to my situation.

lwwfti,[Rant] Not a single student has accessed any of the course material,"We're nearly at reading week in my term, and I've had one particular class that has been beyond frustrating.

It's a seminar style course. They will not turn on cameras. Only three have ever used their microphones. The rest only type ""Thanks!"" in the chat as I dismiss them, and otherwise do not participate.

It has been abundantly clear that they haven't been doing the work and after repeatedly lecturing them to stop guessing at answers and grasping at straws, and actually do the work, I thought I'd run the stats report available through Blackboard to see who had accessed what.

The answer is a big fat no one. The report is definitely working though, because my activity is included in the report and I can see the dates and number of times I accessed the content to make sure it was working. 

But not a single one of my students has opened anything except the digital classroom. Not the readings, not the exam sample paper, not any of the extra resources I painstakingly compiled and uploaded for them. Nothing. 

I'm exhausted and defeated. I know ultimately it's their education, their grades, their knowledge but it is so draining to be the only one who cares.

Update: to say that I have been overwhelmed by the response here would be a significant understatement! We just had class and I did have a reading quiz which they all, unfortunately, did fail. After which, we did have a long chat about them needing to take responsibility and do the work, and I laid out the assessments going forward which are leading up to them doing a presentation/leading the discussion. And by ""had a long chat"" I mean, I essentially lectured them while they sat in silence. Class proceeded as it normally did, with a lot of half-assed guessing and long silences.

8scqtt,[Residency]Why you should do Diagnostic Radiology- Resident's perspective,"Background: I’m a soon to be chief resident (PGY-4, 3rd year radiology for another week) at a mid tier academic program in a big city. Traditional route med student who didn’t know they wanted to do rads until the beginning of 3rd year. Love the field and think there’s a lot of misconception among med students of what it entails. Recently finished boards and have been meaning to do a write up for those interested (or undecided) about radiology.

&nbsp;

**Radiology years:**

&nbsp;

* PGY-1: Intern year- can do a preliminary medicine, surgery or transitional year. Do the easiest thing you can, and if it’s in the same city as your advanced, sweet.
* PGY-2: Radiology R1- The ACGME says 1st year residents can’t take call, making this possible the easiest year on your entire training hours wise. You will be overwhelmed by a completely new way of looking at medicine, but you won’t work nights or any (or very many) weekends. You should be studying to prepare you for….
* PGY-3: Radiology R2- The hardest year of residency work wise. Very call heavy. I worked almost 3 months of night float, and more weekends than I can count. However, this is still better than what people in a surgical or medicine residency go through! 
* PGY-4: Radiology R3- Boards. So radiology does this weird thing where you take a monstrous CORE exam at the end of this year, which is actually only a “Board Certifying exam”.  It’s incredibly difficult, requires months of preparation, with a 80-90% pass rate (but remember, this is a group of nerds with a Step average of 240+ you compete against). There’s an annoying physics section. Time “off” to study is variable per program, but you will be studying several hours a day starting in the winter. The actual “radiology boards” is taken 18 months after residency (during your actual job), and is a joke with close to 100% pass rate. Most programs also allow residents to go to Washington DC for a month (paid for) for AIRP, a radiology pathology lecture course. It’s like being a med student with no responsibilities and no tests for a month. Great for those who don’t have a family to leave behind.  
You will also apply to fellowship this year. Most fellowships are going towards a match (except Body, Chest), and you will apply and interview second half of the year.. Annoyingly during boards prep time. You also find out where you match a couple days after you take boards. Vast majority of fellowships are 1 year, and everyone does one.
* PGY-5: Radiology R4- Boards behind you and majority of call behind you. Most programs let you dictate your schedule, with “mini fellowships” of 4-6 months in your subspecialty of choice. Usually in something to compliment what your actual fellowship is in.

&nbsp;

**Typical day:**

&nbsp;

An example of a typical day of a resident on a diagnostic rotation, such as Musculoskeletal.

8:00 AM Arrive and start “dictating” the studies on the list, which would be plain extremity x-rays or MRIs (knees, shoulders etc) depending on your seniority. This involves dictating a preliminary report of the study, that won’t go out until the attending reviews it.

9:00 AM Go perform a joint injection (fluoroscopic guided hip or shoulder injections mostly, for steroid and pre-MRI arthrogram).  These occur anywhere from 2-5x a day, and usually take 15-30 minutes depending how fast you are. You do all the set up and the attending will come to watch when you’re actually injecting.

10:30-Noon Go “sign out” the studies (xrays, MRIs) you’ve read with the attending.  This is usually sitting next to them while they look over the study and your reports, going over findings and occasionally pimping you.

Noon-1pm: Conference, half are pure didactic and half are case based. Radiology makes it really easy to have a hundred images of different pathologies and going around the room having residents work through them/answer.  Radiology is also much heavier on conferences than other specialties, averaging around 5 hours a week in most programs.  This will go way up for R3s during board studying time.

1pm-5pm: Repeat of the morning

&nbsp;

Other diagnostic rotations would include Neuroradiology, Ultrasound, Body CT, MRI, Breast etc and they all have their own procedures including lumbar punctures, myelograms, thyroid biopsies, breast biopsies etc. There are a lot of procedures outside IR, something I wasn’t aware of before residency. This varies by institution however.

&nbsp;

**Call:** Overall hours wise as a resident you will not be there that long unless call is involved.  Call schedules vary so much among programs that saying mine won’t really help, but R2 year is the busiest with around 1-2 months of night float, and 10-15 weekend day coverage. Radiology doesn’t have separate residents on for different specialties for call (such as a MICU night float, cardiology night float etc) so at most you will have 1-2 residents in the hospital covering ANYTHING radiology related. This includes for us 

1. Dictating every study done on hospital inpatients (minus ICU chest xrays), everything coming through the ED & multiple satellite urgent cares. A car crash with 4 passengers at once? You’ll have 4 CT Chest abdomen pelvis, CT Heads, CT c-spines and an xray of every extremity that hurts on your list at once, with the ED calling you asking for results. It’s overwhelming and exhilarating (for some)

2. Answer calls/pages for anything radiology related, including review studies with surgeons on call, questions about what to order etc. 

3. Performing any diagnostic radiology procedures, including: septic joint aspirations that need fluoroscopy (hips), fluoroscopy guided lumbar punctures, esophagrams for perforations, intussusception reductions. 

4. Fielding IR consults, meaning gathering all the info, consenting, calling in the team and IR attending to perform it. Sometimes we scrub in on these but usually the diagnostic part is so busy we can’t. Some programs with bigger IR sections will have fellows on call to handle this.

Call as a resident is always in house, you will probably never sleep. It is very different that how other specialties handle call. A busier call lets us enjoy a lighter regular schedule.

&nbsp;

I love radiology as a field, and try to convince every med student to do it. Here’s some reasons why:

&nbsp;

**Pure medicine, no BS:**
I believe the 2 big reasons someone pursues medicine are the humanitarian aspect and the science aspect. I leaned towards the latter, and most people I’ve encountered in radiology are the same. My biggest gripe about intern year was how little medicine you do. Pretty much all the data gathering and analysis, including differential for a service could be done in an hour, but you spend the remaining 12 hours calling consults to regurgitate information, call social services, and essentially act as a secretary. This obviously reduces are you become more senior, but hospitalists still do this. Radiology is just you and a study, trying to get information out of it. Non-compliant patient with crazy abscess? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes and told the clinician, now it’s their problem trying to get him to take antibiotics. Diabetic with necrotic pancreatitis? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes, and wash my hands.  You can help so many people, so fast, because you are just doing medicine. Never have to deal with insurance issues, getting someone in a nursing home, trying to get a consult to see a patient. Never have to deal with getting “dumped on” at 5pm, because even if a MRI comes on the list at 4:59? I’ll read it in 10-15 minutes, vs an hour admitting a new patient.  


This gets me to the next point: **You control your own pace.**  There are no nurses you are waiting to get labs, no attending sleeping at home you’re trying to get to round (we do have attendings that read out studies slower than others, but magnitudes less painful than rounds, and this disappears when you’re an attending yourself). You don’t have to wait for pancreatitis to resolve to discharge a patient, you just sign the study and you’re on the next one. Never have a million checkboxes to do for the day, just clicking on study at a time (with procedures thrown in).


**Interacting with colleagues more than patients:** If you love patient interactions, radiology is probably not for you. However, you can still be plenty social in radiology. The only difference is you just spend the entire day talking to coworkers (who are in the same rooms as you) and a bunch of consulting clinicians. I really enjoy talking to clinicians about studies and reviewing them, as opposed to a patient who doesn’t know anything about their care. A perfect medium would be the ability to just review studies with patients who are interested, but don’t think that’s going to be a billable code anytime soon. 


Finally: **It’s like learning a new language.** Every service thinks they can read their own studies (and some can), but vast majority of clinicians have no clue beyond a basic xray.  I still remember telling a pulmonology fellow, when I was an R1, that the pneumothorax he was worried about was just a skin fold. Even early in your training, your abilities will surpass that of attendings in other fields and it feels… awesome. To have someone call with a study saying “I have no idea whats going on” and you know what it is 2 seconds in, is a great feeling. This feeling will only get exemplified in private practice, where everyone is more reliant on radiology.

&nbsp;

So how do you know if radiology is right for you? Here a some characteristics I think that may be a sign that it’s for you.


**You liked the first 2 years of med school more than the 3rd year.**  I was miserable 3rd year, because most specialties have the social work mentioned above, and you’re never in control of your own time. Even intern year was better, but I didn’t really ever enjoy coming to work till I started radiology residency. I have a great social life, but I really enjoy coming to work and just having it be me and my work, with some interactions with colleagues. It’s very similar to studying a bunch the first 2 years (with more free time).


**You are organized/efficient.** The people I see struggling most in radiology are those who are slow. This does not mean they make bad radiologist, on the contrary, I would want a slow methodical radiologist to read my scans. But to be able to keep up with the pace that the field demands and enjoy it, you have to have some sense of speed. Being a techy is also related somewhat, but we’re definitely a minority even in radiology.


**You do not have an ego.** Radiologist will get shit on by every speciality, “clinically correlate” etc etc, and some specialties such as ortho or neurosurgery will pretend you don’t exist. But you have to be ok with not being in the front seat of patient care, and making contributions behind the scenes.

**You are a good test taker.** Radiology is essentially one big test. Staring at the screen, coming to an answer. This will also help with the CORE exam..

&nbsp;

Dismissing some misconceptions about radiology:


**AI-** I’ve literally never heard a radiologist bring this up as a viable threat. We are 20+ years from this making any significant impact, and when it does, it’ll just make our lives easier. We’ll have a 50% unemployment rate from machines before radiologists are actually put out of jobs. Do not worry about it.


**Outsourcing-** Also not a real threat. Clinicians want to talk to their radiologists, which is why not every radiologist is a teleradiologist. There’s a handful than get US board certified and go overseas to read US studies, but this is so rare that it’s a non-issue (and doesn’t save that much money). Teleradiology is definitely a big thing (reading studies from states away), but is seen as a last resort by most due to poor compensation.

&nbsp;


Some real downsides to the field:


**You will work hard.** Attending radiology is not a cush 40 hour work week. This exists in some settings (VA especially), but most are pushing 50-60 hours, with 10+ hour days. These days are BUSY, reading studies and doing procedures non-stop. If you want to have a lot of downtime at work, radiology is not for you. To make up for this, most private practices offer 8-12 weeks of vacation, which can only happen because we have no continuity of care to worry about. Working harder for the same amount of pay is universal in medicine however.


**You always have to be “on”.** You can have a bad day as a hospitalist, maybe half-ass some physical exams and be ok, but if you half-ass some studies, I guarantee you’ll hear about the cancer you missed on the chest x-ray in a few years. Majority of my misses as a resident have been when I’ve been pushing myself to read faster than I should, or was in a hurry to finish. Radiology is unforgiving.


**Attending life is harder than resident life.** As above, your hours get worse (no nights though, that's usually taken care of a hired nighthawk service) and days more stressful because of all the litigation risk, but the pay and vacation are there for that. I’m sure med students are very interested in pay, but I don’t have information that can’t be found online (see doximity compensation report). Of note, the regional variation is huge and you can make family med money in downtown of a big city vs surgical subspecialty money by going rural.

&nbsp;

Hope that helps. I feel like the whole application process and score averages have changed since I applied so not sure how much help I can be of that, but some things: Step 1 is big, research isn’t really (I had nothing). The tier of program only matters if you want to do academics, location is way more important for connections.

1k04fv0,I might actually be an imposter,"I’m in the first year of a top US STEM PhD program, and I’ve been struggling with possibly being an imposter. 

In undergrad, I got very good grades in my STEM majors, but a lot of that happened during COVID. Exams were open-book or canceled, professors were lenient, and honestly, I was just good at optimizing for grades. I took a lot of advanced math and stats classes (even grad-level ones), but looking back, I often didn’t really understand the material deeply. I wasn’t the strongest in my cohort. Still, I ended up with a high GPA and got into this PhD program.

The problem now is that everything has shifted. I’m no longer doing math homework or proving theorems—I’m supposed to design and run experiments, generate research questions, and engage in scholarly discussions. And I’m completely untrained for that. I never practiced building hypotheses or designing behavioral studies in undergrad. I mostly got involved in research just to check the right boxes for PhD admissions.

Now, I attend 3–5 seminars a week, and I don’t pay attention in 80–90% of them. I dissociate, zone out, pretend to take notes, and rarely ask questions. I rely on ChatGPT to summarize papers because I can’t focus enough to read them. I feel ashamed constantly. Everyone else around me seems engaged, publishing already, and able to understand complicated models with ease. Meanwhile, I feel like I’m falling apart under the surface.

I haven’t launched a single experiment, and I keep procrastinating because I’m afraid I don’t even know how to design a proper one. I’m overwhelmed, paralyzed, and stuck in a constant state of comparison and fear.

So I keep wondering: Am I just undertrained and anxious, or did I fake my way in and finally hit the wall?

hd5va6,"I'm 26, and college is too hard. I feel like giving up.","I just registered for my fall 2020 classes, and am already overwhelmed.

I'm still considered a SOPHOMORE at my age, and it's extremely frustrating when everyone else is graduating with their masters at 24!

My biggest issue is that I used to take two courses per semester because I have ADHD, and get side-tracked so easily. I go from studying to thinking about what I should eat for lunch, and my mind goes on an adventure. Next thing you know, two hours have passed, and I didn't get anything done.

Full-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving 12+ credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes?? How do you manage to not fail taking these overwhelming classes all at once?

**EDIT: Seriously, I thank every one of you for your comments. Your thoughts and advice alone make me feel encouraged.
I should add that I am not getting any professional help for my ADHD. For some reason, I feel shameful in asking for drugs like Adderall because I don’t want people thinking I’m just trying to boost my way through college with the help of stimulants. Another HUGE issue of mine is insomnia. It’s currently 4:18 AM, and I can’t sleep (this is the norm). I have constant racing thoughts, and it leads to day time drowsiness. Not sure if I’ll ever get a college degree. I guess it’s time I get some professional help for my health issues. But aside from that, THANK YOU FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT.

1ldm79p,Overwhelmed and dont know how im going to pay for college,"I knew college was going to be expensive, but it just dawned on me how expensive it truly will be. I'm already commited to a state school, went to the freshman orientation and everything. After going to that orientation, I started to look deeper into costs and realized that I'm completely out of my depth financially. My yearly financial aid is 9000 less than the cost of tuition + dorms. Earlier I thought I'd be fine, I could just get a job in the summer and apply for scholarships. 

But then it's been a month and nobody wants to hire me. And then I found out that scholarships dont get added on, the school just reduces the financial aid given to you. I won a state scholarship two months ago and I only got 7 more dollars in my aid offer.

With all this, I just don't see how I'm going to pay for college. My parents are very poor and won't be able to help, they have 7 other kids to take care of. And I don't know if I'd be able to pay back 40,000+ dollars in loans. 

But I hesitate to withdraw from college since I feel like I have to pave the way for my younger siblings. My parents didn't graduate high school and didnt go to college and I'm the oldest of 8 so I want to set an example for all of them and show them that its possible. I don't want them to end up like my parents with no career and struggling to make ends meet. 

But I also don't know if its worth it to get into so much debt. I feel like im an idiot for not researching all this sooner.

To make it worse, the team lead acts more like a high school teacher than a mentor. Hard deadlines get thrown at us without any discussion, and we're constantly reminded of them like we’re slacking. If something slips, it’s assumed we’re lazy or not good enough, instead of just... overwhelmed.

1mpp3gb,Review of my PhD experience: some advice,"I graduated recently, and the last item on my PhD mental list is to do this post. 

I thought I should share some advice for folks entering the PhD program, or in the midst of it. A PhD is a journey and for those in it, I wish you all the best.

**Happy to answer an questions you may have.** 

**Context**: I provide some context info as it may provide some information on my experience. Obviously, my experience is my own but maybe some of my advice may be useful to some 

* PhD in social science in Canada. 
* International student from Europe. 
* Married. 
* Funded via PhD supervisor stipend to begin with then won PhD provincial/state funding for the remaining of PhD. 
* Took 1 year mat leave toward end of PhD
* Worked RAs and other odd jobs (i.e. translations). No TAs.
* Age: late 30s to early 30s. Already had a MSc and was working in another field before moving to PhD
* Currently doing a postdoc in another country. 

**Advice**: not in order of importance (brain dump).

* **Mindset:**
   * A PhD is a job. A not well paid one, but a job nonetheless. For some people, it is their whole identity. And that's ok. But for others, it is a mean to an end, and that is fine as well. Don't compare yourself to others. Success takes many different forms. 
   * Set “office hours” and communicate them to your supervisor and team. You can change them over time and accept to work extra hours if needed but that should be exceptional not the norm.
   * Establish clear boundaries on what you're willing to accept and what you're not. Example: I refused late-night calls from my supervisor, even when others accepted them. I communicated this clearly and created an organized feedback process to avoid being in the position of having to deal with 10pm calls on a Sunday. It didn’t always work perfectly, but it protected my time.
   * You are doing a thesis and starting your carrier, you are not an unpaid assistant doing the work of 4 people for the sake of uplifting your supervisor. Your duty is to your thesis, not to your supervisor. If this is the mindset of your lab/supervisor, then it is wrong. 
   * Boundaries may mean missing out on last-minute gigs or RA opportunities. Did it impact my career? Maybe. But I didn’t burn out and that mattered more to me.
* **Wellbeing:**
   * Life during a PhD doesn’t have to suck.. Sit in a park. Join a student group, neighbourhood activities or anything that sparks joy.
   * Take care of your physical and emotional health. Walk, move, rest, get help if needed.
   * You don’t have to do everything: Do enough extracurriculars to show engagement, but don’t overextend. If someone points out what you haven’t done, highlight what you *have* done.
* **Relationships:**
   * Treat labmates and fellow students as professional peers, even if you become friends. 
   * Don't engage in gossip. Walls have ears.
   * Always be respectful to admin staff. They often do their best to support students in a broken system. But push back against some decisions, kindly, if needed. You have to advocate for yourself.
* Supervisors are individuals, not omniscient beings.
   * Meet them before signing up.
   * The most senior/famous supervisor may not be the right one. Make sure that you go into a supervisor relationship with open eyes with what they bring to *you* and *your goals.*
   * Ask to speak with current and former students of the supervisor before signing up. If they refuse, that’s a red flag.
   * Build rapport. Share your goals and expectations.
   * You can say no. You can push back.
   * If they’re tyrannical, speak to your graduate coordinator. You don’t have to endure abuse.
   * Ask and you may receive. Most people I met were scared of asking for money/support/perspectives to their supervisor. Worse is that they say no. Just ask, you never know. 
   * You can change supervisor. It is ok. It happens. 
* **Communication:**
   * Be organized in supervisory meetings: Plan an agenda and talking points. Communicate what kind of feedback/support you need. Structure your discussions to make the most of limited time.
   * Many criticisms are not personal. Learn to separate feedback from identity. My supervisor is obsessive with wording and word editing. My documents would always be full of track changes, but when the change is from *highlight* to *showcase,* I draw the line on what is useful and what is not.
* **Advisory team:**
   * Choose advisors for both expertise and complementary strengths. For example: if your supervisor is hands-off, pick someone who knows academic processes and can support you emotionally.
   * Look for methodological and personal compatibility within the advisory team.
* **Thesis examination:**
   * Pay attention to potential examiners over the years Listen to student stories
   * Dont let your supervisor pressure you into choosing someone you are not comfortable with (but provide them with an alternative).
* **Conferences, courses, side projects:**
   * Map out your PhD goals and stick to them. If something excites you (like beekeeping in Easter Island) and is not related to your thesis, go for it. But if you’re overwhelmed or unsure, it’s okay to say no.
   * Learn transferable skills beyond your thesis that can open doors outside of academia in your field. But your thesis is your priority
   * Even a small lab presentation help build confidence. You will never feel ready to present and looking back my first presentation sucked but i got better.
   * Apply to the small awards, they build up your capacity in grant writing and can make you feel good (and money yay) if you get them. 
* **Writing and research workflow:**
   * Organise your reference software monthly: Add pdfs, check metadata (names, dates, journals).
   * Set up weekly database checks for new papers.
   * Write notes, always. Never delete anything but rather save cut sections from drafts in a separate document. Even half-baked ideas can become gold later (one of mine shaped my discussion section!).

And lastly, as a wise friend told me when I started my PhD, if you knew what you needed to do to get your PhD in advance, it would take you only a year to get a PhD. The PhD process is about following a lot of dead ends, being wrong a lot, and learning.

1kt6v4i,The learned helplessness and low skills are killing me,"I hate to get on here to vent, but vent away I need to do today. I teach in a dual credit program and there is no real gatekeeping or counseling for students who come to college straight from 10th grade. They (I think) believe they will still be taught what they would be taught if they stayed at the high school. But they aren't...freshman writing is taught at the college level, and they leap over 72 weeks (11th and 12th grades) of English instruction=literature, critical reading, vocabulary building, critical thinking, writing analytically about texts, when they come to college from 10th grade.

So many of my students have no self-direction as learners and then there is the above-mentioned skills gaps. On top of all the low attendance, not studying, last minute production of work, etc., etc. Many of them come here because they're not making it at the high school, which is a different set of challenges to teach around.

What saddens me is that, in every class, the students (some who are in the dual enrollment program and those who matriculated and are true first-year college students) who are engaged and make effort have to put up with this immature stuff/lack of preparedness in all of their classes (believe me, they tell me all about it).

1hn7zlk,Made several huge mistakes in my first semester as a professor ,"I still feel so stressed and horrible. This is my first semester as a professor, but I’ve taught before in grad school, so I feel like I shouldn’t have made these mistakes. 

I’m teaching two courses. Both were new to me, but previous instructors let me use their preps. 

Some of the mistakes:

-Although I used someone else’s prep for the classes, for one of them, I decided to change some things, including the point distribution. However, I forgot to actually change the number of points in one of the assignments, so the syllabus said the total class was out of 500 points, but in reality was out of 490. I didn’t notice until the very end, and had to calculate grades based off of 490.

-Posted the wrong assignment instructions twice (had to extend the deadlines for those)

-One night, I stayed up all night furiously prepping but then ended up accidentally falling asleep and waking up minutes before my class, knew I couldn’t make it to campus in time, and cancelled the class. Since it’s a super early morning class, many students probably hadn’t seen the email before getting to campus. 


I’ve learned a lot, and I plan to put all I’ve learned into making next semester better. I love teaching and care about my students, which is exactly why I feel bad for fucking up. 

If anyone has any advice on how to stay organized and on top of things, I’d love to hear it!!

EDIT: I’ve been spending time with family for the holidays and not fully keeping up with all the comments, but wanted to say THANK YOU for all the encouragement and advice. I am seriously overwhelmed. If you have any more words of wisdom, keep it coming haha, I love it.
 
I hope you have all of the support in the world going into the next semester and beyond. ❤️",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hn7zlk/made_several_huge_mistakes_in_my_first_semester/

1dwsq8y,I loathe the digitization of schoolwork,"Currently, all of my schoolwork has a major online component, and it drives me crazy. My textbooks are only available as ebooks (and the ones I can get in print cost upwards of $200). My assignment instructions are listed on an online course page, and the place to create and submit my assignments is on a different page. Then I need to pull up more websites of journal articles for research. So every time I do my schoolwork, I have at least 5 different pages open. Clicking between different pages to find the one I'm looking for is so tedious. Is this the browser with my instructions? No, that's the browser with my submission. Oh there are the instructions. Where is my ebook tab? No, that's the journal article I pulled up. Oh, there's the ebook! And then it's so ahrd for me to navigate through an ebook. Sometimes the next page button takes me to the next ""page"", and sometimes it takes me to a new section. I can't easily leaf through the book to find what I'm looking for. This is a nightmare for my ADHD. I always feel overwhelmed when doing this schoolwork. I feel like I am just not cut out for this. Thank you for reading my dumb rant.

EDIT: I really appreciate all y'all's replies. I feel so seen about this issue haha. And I'm sorry for contributing to the general negativity of this online space. I see a lot of people recommending a second monitor. Due to my ADHD, I need to move around when I do work. I'll spend an hour at the library, then move to my office for an hour, then home, etc. I don't have access to a second monitor, or the ability to set up a second monitor, in most places I do work. I'm glad that works for the folks who have it! Another complaint I just remembered about everything being digital is I can't work outside. I need to have access to an outlet to keep my computer charged. And then usually the sun is so bright that I can't see my screen. I can't even do work when riding in the passenger seat of a car because of how bright the sun is coming through the windshield. It wouldn't be so bad if ebook software would allow me to print sections, but none of the software my courses use allows this :/",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1dwsq8y/i_loathe_the_digitization_of_schoolwork/
1m1s2lw,I’m in my 4th year of a PhD with no publications. I feel broken and lost. How do I keep going?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve just started my fourth year of a PhD, and I still don’t have a single publication. I’m working on multiple projects, but I have absolutely no motivation to do any of them. I’ve tried all kinds of productivity techniques — daily planners, checklists, Pomodoro, to-do lists — but nothing seems to work anymore.

I used to be willing to keep pushing. But now, every time I think about what I need to do, I just feel overwhelmed and like crying. I can’t even enjoy the things I used to like before.

I’ve also had to go through several personal challenges — both in my family and outside of it — and I still deal with anxiety and emotional exhaustion. I think I’m grieving, and possibly depressed, though it’s hard to even label what I’m feeling. I just know I feel stuck and lost.

Socially, I’ve been really isolated. I don’t like talking to people or socializing much, and I don’t have close communication with my lab mates either. My lab isn’t very diverse. I often feel like I don’t quite fit in.

My advisor is chill — he’s never called me out or pressured me when I don’t have progress to show. Sometimes I think I see disappointment on his face, but maybe I’m just misinterpreting — I don’t know.

I feel like I don’t belong in this program. Like I’m not cut out for a PhD and maybe I just made a mistake coming here.

But I don’t know what to do. If any of you have felt this way — unmotivated, isolated, emotionally drained — and found a way through, I would really appreciate hearing your experience. Thank you for reading.

19323ww,The 7 habits of highly miserable PhD students,"I was reflecting on my PhD experience and thought to break down the things where I made poor decisions. This post is a reflection of my own experiences and might not reflect the experience of every struggling PhD student. People often write about the qualities of a good PhD student, I thought to write the opposite so that one can avoid it to stay on track.

1. They leave no stone unturned to please their supervisors.
2. They don't speak for themselves. They want to look nice in front of others.
3. They care more about the happiness of others instead of their own.
4. They stay late on campus with the hope of doing some work but keep scrolling social media (Revenge Procrastination). Then they sleep late and start the next day with regret. They neglect their health with poor eating habits.
5. They don't take responsibility for their actions. They daydream and wait for the light-bulb moment. Months can pass while they keep on planning.
6. They are very good at doing all sorts of tasks besides their PhD. Then even take pride in that. Every time a distraction comes (in the form of work with monetary benefits, or someone needing help), they will put their PhD in the far corner and shift their focus on the secondary task.
7. They engage themselves in unnecessary comparisons. They will scroll Google Scholar profile of each researcher they are reading about in literature and then feel guilty about it. They feel like a failure. Although they feel motivated to do the same (publishing papers, getting citations) their actions don't support their dreams. Hence they move around in circles.

Thanks for reading. Please share your experiences.

**Edit 1:** Thanks very much everyone for reading and sharing your experiences. I am overwhelmed by the coverage of this post. I never thought that it would touch so many people.

I was avoiding my work and then inspiration ferry came and told me to write this. It took me a couple of minutes to put down my thoughts and I am glad that the message went across. Procrastination sometimes does wonders.

On a general note, everyone struggles in grad school (one way or the other), I think it is about survival. Some people are good at hiding their struggles but the struggle is there. I wish you all the best. Keep going!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/19323ww/the_7_habits_of_highly_miserable_phd_students/
lb428t,I'm losing my patience with entitled demanding students pt 2,"Yesterday, I made a post where I vented about how frustrated I was at the entitled and demanding emails. I walked away feeling like maybe I was too hard on them and it’s just been some lone incidents. They are overwhelmed. It can’t be EVERY day that I have to deal with this kind of entitlement. And yet, I woke up today to the following hot mess:

I opened a late start course this morning and students were able to see the syllabus for the first time. A student from this course emails telling me that the textbook I have listed is not the one from the bookstore. She rants for a little bit about the disorganization of our school and how she expects us to correct it or she expects me to give her an extension on the reading assignments until the new book arrives, or, she adds, “whoever is responsible can pay me the cost to overnight the correct book to me.” 

I sigh at the tone of her email but I should probably investigate because it's not like a mistake is a complete impossibility and if there was a mistake it will impact the whole class so I should probably find out. I go to the bookstore website and the book listed there is correct so I’m super confused. I email back and tell her that no, it’s correct there and is she sure she looked at the right course?

Nope, she says. She has photographic memory and that’s what it said. They must have updated it after she bought her books. It's not fair blah blah blah and someone needs to fix this immediately. She is just done with our school and how disorganized everyone is, she rants.

So I waste an hour of my life reaching out to the bookstore because if she is actually right (mistakes have definitely happened before), then I need to rearrange some things to make sure any student who bought the wrong book can catch up. Sure she’s being a complete asshole but that doesn’t mean that someone somewhere didn’t make a mistake. Although oddly, I haven’t heard from anyone else with the same issue. But… I don’t want to assume. After several emails, the bookstore manager sends me her inventory list that hasn’t been changed since November showing that the correct book has been listed since November.

Fine. I gather from this that the student hasn’t bought her book yet and is manipulating me to buy more time. I email her back and say I don’t know what to tell her and include the screen shot from their inventory.

At this point, she replies “oh. I got the book for the wrong professor. I didn’t look it up when I ordered my books because I thought I remembered but I guess I got it wrong. You have a complicated name. I will order the correct one but I’m going to need a 2 week extension for all reading assignments or assignments that require a textbook or I need you to reach out to the bookstore to tell to refund the fee to overnight it to correct the mistake.” 

Me: No. 

At no point during any of this demanding and ranting did she bother to make sure she actually had the right professor.

18yo1sj,I just got suspended,"I’m an undecided sophomore at a small but pretty selective liberal arts school, I worked so hard to get there but now I feel like I’ve ruined everything. I was going through an incredibly dark period last semester and I ended up failing two of my classes pretty badly. As per college policy I was suspended as a student for next semester. I don’t know what to do, I’ve heard you can fight these things but I’m not sure if that applies in this situation or if I even want to. The break has helped me a bit but I’m still not feeling great. I feel so guilty, I feel like I’ve let my family down and all of my friends too. They were so proud when I got in how can I tell them I’ve screwed up this badly? I don’t even know how to tell anyone aside from my dad. Since I was just supposed to be home for winter break all of my stuff is still at school and it’s an 8 hour car ride to get there and I don’t have a license so I need to get my family to help me. Everyone graduates from my school on time but now I’m going to be behind even aside from the classes I failed. I could do the summer semester which would catch me up some but I feel so disappointed in myself. I could see about taking community college courses, but I don’t know if it would even transfer over. I had a job over the summer I could see if I can go back to or I could try to find an internship or something. I’m so overwhelmed I was supposed to go back in less than a week.
Edit: I posted this immediately after finding out, some of these comments helped me calm down a lot, and to those of you in a similar situation I hope things get better. I decided not to appeal, I really do need a break to work on my mental health and deal with the changes that have happened in my life recently. I had spent the last semester in a daze and this helped bring me back to reality. I am incredibly lucky as all of my friends and family have been supportive and are helping me a lot. As all of my friends are going to be at school it will be a bit isolating for me to be staying here but I need to find a job anyways so hopefully I’ll be able to meet new people. I’m definitely still feeling overwhelmed by all of this but I feel like I can manage now. ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/18yo1sj/i_just_got_suspended/
1cxsg5a,Do it already: get stricter with your attendance and late work policies,"I know institutional/school/departmental policies and support vary among us, but if you can get stricter with your attendance and late work policies, I encourage you to do so next semester. After lots of hand wringing over wanting to bring more structure into my classes since loosening my attendance and late work policies since covid, I finally went ahead with it this spring. I expected lots of complaints and groveling for special exceptions, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn’t the case.

I had no complaints (at least none to my face; evals forthcoming), and only a handful of students asked for exceptions (a few deserving and I was happy to make the requested accommodations). One student, after realizing that I was going to enforce my policies, told me that he ""locked in"" and will now pass the class with an A. Several students told me that these policies actually helped them stay on top of the coursework and motivated them to come to class, and they could see a direct correlation between doing those things and performing well. On my end, I can attest that what they are feeling is actually true as I see higher class averages in all of my courses. So even if they do complain in the evals, I’ll point to the success rates as my rebuttal.

Another benefit is that I am no longer haunted: getting stricter has drastically cut down on the amount of ghosts emailing me on the last days of the semester asking “if there’s a way” to still pass the class, offering to turn in months worth of missing assignments to add to the pile of finals that I’m grading.

And I’ve had fewer cases of that new breed of student, the one who regularly attends and actively participates in class but never turns anything in, possibly because you’ve coddled them and assured them that you will accept any and all of their work up until–and maybe even beyond!--the end of the semester. You appreciate their participation in class so you do them this favor of giving them extended deadlines, but you aren’t helping them! You’re actually adding to their mental anguish as the end of the term arrives and they are overwhelmed and psychologically paralyzed by the unsurmountable workload before them. If you really want to help them, you need to provide encouragement, support, *and structure*. They will either figure it out, or they will be able to drop the class and focus their energies elsewhere rather than languish and feel guilty about wasting their professor’s grace. 

For context, I teach composition at a cc with a reputable transfer rate, so there are both high and low achieving students with what we might call ""bad habits."" Here are the new policies that I put in my syllabi this semester:

**Late work**

* Low stakes assignments (mostly discussion posts and reading response): no later than one week past the deadline for half credit
* Major essay assignments: a single-use late pass good for 72 hours. Otherwise, 11 point deduction from a 100-point assignment (meaning no A possible) the first day, and 5 points deducted each day thereafter

**Attendance**

* 2 permitted absences, no questions asked. Third absence results in 5% deduction from overall grade. The deduction doubles with each additional absence. So a fourth absence makes it nearly impossible to get an A, and a sixth absence results in a failing grade. 

**Tardiness**

* I take attendance at the beginning of class. If a student arrives after I’ve gone through the roster, then I mark them as late. After they’ve been late 3 times, all additional late arrivals will still be recorded as absences and will count toward the attendance policy.

It is not in my nature to be this strict, but I felt that it was what my students needed after 4 years of (warranted) unlimited grace. My only regret is that I didn’t do this last semester, maybe even last year.

**TL;DR**

Get stricter with your attendance and late work policies! You and your students will benefit from it.   

P.S. Yes, I am posting this as a form of procrastination to avoid the finals I need to get back to grading.

1mginqs,Important PSA on SOAP and applications,"PGY-1 here who had to SOAP last cycle. Luckily, turned out great for me as I ended up in a hospital I already knew about and was interest in due to their healthy culture and great benefits.

I was completely blindsided last March, and I wanted to share a few things I learned so that at least 1 person can avoid the traumatic experience that is SOAP. 

Background: I applied a hyper competitive specialty. Without doxxing myself, Had 13+ research items including several pubmed indexed articles, honor societies, unique story, strong LORs, and honors in all rotations related to the specialty including all my aways at prestigious programs. Went to a T50 program that is well regarded at least regionally. 

Important lessons:

1) Get a GOOD/HONEST academic advisor. My school advisors were all nice people, but weren’t upfront with me about how weaker parts of my application would be perceived. They convinced me I didn’t need to worry. 

2) Aways will gaslight you. I didn’t want to believe it. For example, I was told by the president of a prestigious program that I was basically guaranteed to match there, he just couldn’t say it out loud. Interviewers were gassing me up. I was also getting interviews from T20 hospitals so I really thought I was fine.

3) Your support system is everything. I really found out how much my friends and family truly cared about me when they all stopped what they were doing to help me. It was truly a humbling experience that I’ll never forget. Please be there for your friends who end up in this situation. 

4) You could SOAP into a gen surg or IM pre-lim spot, but the odds of matching next cycle are not in your favor depending on speciality. I spoke with PDs from the speciality I applied, and they told me they haven’t taken a pre-lim in over a decade. Again without doxxing myself, on PD had a lot of inside data on this and knew that programs very rarely took pre-lims. Many programs look at you like a second class citizen. Pre lim spots are also only for one year, so if you don’t match a categorical spot when you re-apply, you just end up in the same situation next year but without help from your school and friends who are now busy with residency.


Here’s what happens during SOAP week for those who don’t know:

1) Get an email Monday morning saying sorry, you didn’t match. Hard to fully explain how completely devastating that is. You are overwhelmed by grief, loss, fear, sorrow, etc. 

2) You now have less than 24 hours to apply to a different program from a list of unfilled programs. If you applied a hyper competitive specialty, this probably means a different specialty all together. This also means you need to rewrite your PS and get new letters to convince PDs that you would be a good fit. Keep in mind you are doing this after just finding out you didn’t match and are emotionally messed up. 

Important note: 90+% of the left over programs are left over for a reason. Might be due to location, reputation, toxicity, accreditation issues, etc. Sometimes you’re lucky (like me) and they’re left over due clerical issues or decent programs just being overlooked due to geographical preference. 

3) You sit around for two days praying that programs will randomly call you and interview you. It can happen at any time so you just sit around in nice clothes waiting for a call. I’ve had more than my fair share of dark times in my life, but these two days easily take the cake. Imagine hoping to get calls from programs you’re not thrilled about, to practice in a speciality you didn’t plan on, because the alternative is being on the hook for 300k with no way to pay it off and no way to practice clinical medicine - the thing you’ve sacrificed everything to do. There were a surprising amount of people I saw getting interviewed so it was still competitive. For example, over 50 people were interviewed for my spot. 

You know what’s messed up? Interviewers were STILL gas lighting me during SOAP. A program went almost completely unfilled and had a ton of open spots, and gassed me up during the interview. Then got a call from the PD and chief to make sure I passed the vibe check which they told me I did. They also told me they haven’t called anyone else and were seriously interested in me. All to not get an offer the next day. 

4) Thursday rolls around and offers come in 4 waves every 3 hours starting at 9am. If no offers, think the unfilled programs can just call and talk to you and vice versa. I was luckily given an offer very early so I wasn’t in this position so I don’t know for sure. 

What I would have done differently:

1) dual apply - it sucks and it’s extra work, but if you SOAP, you’re going to have to do that anyways. Difference is, if you dual apply, you at least have more than 22 hours to get your application together when you’re not at the lowest point of your life. You also have the ability to choose WHERE you end up. Mostly very small rural areas where left in the SOAP, so if that doesn’t appeal to you, I’d think about dual applying to at least have a choice of where you live. 

2) don’t listen to aways - I really didn’t want to believe this subreddit when they said that they will gas you up but it’s very true. They might even write you little love letters and make you think you are golden, but dont believe them and do what’s best for you. 

3) I would have looked up what happens during SOAP and prepared myself by at least re-writing my personal statements. It’s on me for being blindsided since I didn’t look anything up, but I think that was a combination of being scared, wishful thinking, and being so burnt out from med school I didn’t want to do any extra work. 

One last note - it’s very hard to know what will make you happy. I thought I would feel like a “failure” if I wasn’t in a big academic program in a big city. These programs were actually more toxic than I thought at first glance. IMO, it’s not worth it to be treated like that just to say you trained at X place. Things that actually have made me happy so far - wonderful co resident, strong benefits, higher pay with lower cost of living, creature comforts like solid restaurants and shopping, reasonable hours, and supportive attendings who give me a ton of autonomy and coach me through procedures. I’ve seen more prestigious programs pay their residents like crap and just make them do scutwork until PGY-3 year instead of you know, staffing the department appropriately and/or hiring midlevels to help. 

Anyways, good luck this cycle and I wish you all the best! ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mginqs/important_psa_on_soap_and_applications/
1n4484q,Failing my first class,"Lowly M1 here and feeling very overwhelmed and stressed. My school has a very unorthodox curriculum (I’ve seen multiple posts here from my classmates venting about it and we’re only 2 months in). I know it’s supposed to feel like you’re drinking from the fire hose, but I just feel like I’m barely learning. 

A passing grade in this class is a 70 and I’m currently at a 65. We only have 3 weeks left. We have a weekly exam and my grades are horrible. I felt really good about this week, which was the first time I had actually grasped the material, and I found out I made a 54%. 

In addition to making a 70 in the class, we have a minimum grade we have to get on the final to pass. The whole thing is stressing me out and I don’t know what’s going to happen if I have to retake this class. And I’m really wondering if I’m the only one failing.

1mhwbfj,Burned out and no motivation to finish phd,"Hi everyone,  
I’m a physics PhD student heading into my second year this August, and I’m feeling completely drained. If I’m being honest, I was already burned out *before* I started the program. I only applied because my mentors strongly encouraged (or pressured) me to, and I didn’t really feel read but I went ahead with it anyway.

Now, a year in, I’m struggling. I sit down to work almost every day, but end up feeling overwhelmed, lost, and hopeless. Some days I just stare at my screen or scroll through my phone for hours, unable to do anything meaningful. It’s like I *want* to care, but I just don’t have it in me anymore.

My advisor is a decent person ok, not harsh but also not helpful. He’s very hands-off, gives vague directions, and often goes weeks without checking in. I’ll write out long, detailed emails with questions, only to get one-word or dismissive replies that don’t address what I asked. To make matters harder, his accent makes it tough for me to follow during the rare times we do talk.

Weekly group meetings were the one consistent thing, but lately they’ve been getting cancelled for whatever reasons. I have groupmates, but I don’t feel particularly close to any of them. And to top it off, I get horrible anxiety before and after every meeting just thinking about research sends me spiraling sometimes.

I know part of this is on me. I applied to a PhD program when I wasn’t mentally ready, and I’ve been questioning my decision ever since. I’ve considered mastering out, but I’m still unsure. I’m terrified that I’ve lost the willpower or drive to do *any* kind of work, in or out of academia.

So I’m asking:

* Has anyone here mastered out? What was your experience like, and do you regret it?
* For those who’ve stayed: How did you find motivation again when you felt totally lost?
* And if anyone’s been in a similar spot, how did you start to pull yourself out?

Any thoughts would help. I just feel really alone in this.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mhwbfj/burned_out_and_no_motivation_to_finish_phd/
1ldyr13,"I Don’t Want to Reward Students for Pestering, Just Me?","Student emails me at 9pm last night with a question (about an assignment students almost never have questions about because I’ve been teaching it this way for years). 

Student sends a follow up at noon today (with the rationale that they feel overwhelmed if they don’t have all the details).

I now feel caught between two meh options. I don’t want to respond right away because I feel like this rewards bad behavior, but I also don’t want to wait too long because it is my job to reply, etc. and I do actually want to help. My syllabus says to allow up to 48 business hours for email replies, even though my personal standard is to reply within 24. 

So now I’m trying to figure out when I would have replied if the student had not sent this follow up. 

Anyone else get this? Anyone else tempted to sit on emails for a minute to help students learn reasonable expectations for response times and to develop some skills for handling their feelings around short delays? 

Edit update:
Thanks all! I replied. I also let the student know that per the syllabus, they shouldn’t follow up on emails for at least 2 business days— and that in their future job, they should allow a full 3-5 BDs. 

I heard some great suggestions—

1. Replying right away but scheduling the send for a more appropriate time. I love the idea. 

2. Having students wait until office hours to ask questions about assignments. Very interesting. I don’t hold routine office hours, so it wouldn’t work for me, but I can see it as a good way to teach students to plan ahead for those who do host regular office hours.

3. Having specific hours of the day when they reply to student emails. I like this one too. I might try this for future students with an early course announcement like: “I reply to student emails each day from 3-4 pm. Consider this our virtual, asynchronous office hour. Make sure to plan ahead and work on your assignments in advance so that you have enough time to ask any questions that may arise for you.” I like this. 

They really do need help adjusting to professional norms. Their future bosses will not thank us if we encourage them to expect immediate responses to requests. 

Thanks all! Appreciate you sharing perspective on this with me. That was helpful. ",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ldyr13/i_dont_want_to_reward_students_for_pestering_just/
jj62q6,"Pro tip for those 11th hour ""student has a 13%, has done nothing all semester, and asks if they can do makeup work"" emails","I used to get these emails and I would spend countless hours jumping through hoops to help students by creating alternative assignments (since the answers were often already out there by this point) and most of the time they don't do it anyway. Or at least not enough to make a real dent in anything. Or I know the student won't actually do it and have said no and then wind up having to go meet with my Chair after the student complains and gives some type of sob story (some which may actually be valid but that doesn't mean the student is going to actually do the work). I'm always happy to go above and beyond to help a student who is actually willing to do the work but 99 times out of 100, if they haven't done the work all semester, they aren't going to start now. So I have started doing the following and I swear by this... I have had so much less drama. So here's my go-to...

I say yes **but** under the following conditions:

1. Student must have a meeting (virtually now) with an academic support coach to address the issues regarding why they are having trouble keeping up with their academic work. I then need 2 paragraphs sharing a specific plan for what they plan to do differently going forward and how they are going to implement that. 
2. I need a written plan for specific due dates of when they plan to turn in each item that I need to agree to before moving forward. (I wouldn't say no to anything other than ""turn everything in the last day of class"" ... I don't have time for that kind of grading at that point). 

If they meet the above criteria, student may get 70% credit for any item that they turn in on the dates that we agreed to (speeches and exams are an exception... they can't get back credit for those). 

Best case: they have a chance to reevaluate why they are struggling and make a plan for themselves going forward and can get back on track  
Worst case: they do nothing and I didn't waste a ton of time 

Do you know how many students have actually taken me up on this? One. In my entire teaching career. And I was actually really glad she did... she was a fall athlete in her first semester of college who was just drowning. She had been an honors student in high school but was taking far too many classes, in a major that was a horrible fit for her (her parents were pushing her to do it), and just overall overwhelmed trying to balance school and a crazy schedule. She had a 'come to Jesus' moment at the end of that semester and even sat out a few games to catch up. I just wrote her recommendation for grad school (without a single reservation... she really turned it around).

a4qau2,Why does it seem like so many people are so anxious and depressed?,"Hello everyone, hope you are all having a fun finals week.

&#x200B;

I have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit.  As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.

&#x200B;

I know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.

&#x200B;

I just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling? There's just a lot going on in life right now and so much different things to think about it and I just wonder how people balance it or maintain a balanced mindset.

1ip4mce,Your PhD Doesn’t Define You—And That’s a Good Thing,"I finished my PhD in Australia last year, and looking back, my perspective on the whole journey has shifted in ways I didn’t expect. When you're deep in it, a PhD can feel like everything—your identity, your future, the measure of your worth. But it’s not.

Your work is valuable, but it’s not as important as it feels right now. The long hours, the stress, the pressure to publish—it all makes it seem like your entire existence hinges on this one degree. But the truth is, you are so much more than your PhD. You have relationships, interests, skills, and a whole life beyond your research.

And when you finish? A PhD isn’t a golden ticket to instant success. It’s a stepping stone, not a finish line. Some doors open, some don’t, and sometimes the best opportunities come from places you never expected. That’s why it’s important to save some of yourself for what comes after—whether it’s a career in academia, industry, or something entirely different.

So if you’re feeling overwhelmed, just remember: your PhD is something you do, not something you are. Keep going, but don’t lose yourself in the process. There’s a whole world waiting for you beyond your thesis.

vw3u15,Things I wish someone told me before I started college,"Since many people will be going off to college for the first time in about a month, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to make this post. I recommend you read everything, but you can certainly skip around if you wish. Also, just because this post is geared toward people who haven't been to college before doesn't mean returning students won't find any good advice here. I encourage all college students to check out this post, and if you've been to college before feel free to share your own insight too!

&#x200B;

***\[1\] Academics- Building A Good Schedule***

* **Get familiar with the logistics of course selection**. Many colleges have specific websites or platforms used to pick classes. Each school does it a bit differently, so make sure you know what to expect.
* **Know the exact day and time you can start picking classes**. You want the best chance of getting into the classes you want, especially if you’re a freshman with little to no credits earned. With that said, it’s okay if you get an undesirable schedule! You earn new credits and get earlier pick times each semester, meaning you’ll have more and more classes to choose from.
* **Have backups for your classes**. As discussed above, you might not get into all the classes you want, but you still need to take at least 12 credits per semester to remain a full-time student.
* **Put together a balanced schedule**. Avoid making your schedule too challenging during the first semester or two; instead, add 1-2 interesting general education classes to your schedule. If your very first semester is difficult academically, you can get overwhelmed keeping up with academic expectations while also learning how to adjust to a new living environment, maintain a social life, get enough sleep, etc. Once you’ve been here for at least a semester, you’ll know how to succeed outside of academics and will be able to focus more on excelling in class.
* **Use RateMyProfessors wisely**. Sometimes you must take a certain class for your major or the only person teaching it has bad reviews, but for gen eds or classes where there are multiple instructors it’s best to choose someone with good reviews. Also, while I have found the website to be rather accurate when professors have many reviews, gauging quality objectively becomes much harder when there are just a few reviews.
* **Consider taking an early morning class**. . Dragging yourself to an 8 or 9 am might seem awful, but keep in mind that many clubs and social events take place during weekday evenings and you could miss them if you have late classes. Of course, if you absolutely cannot wake up early and have alternative options, then don't take a morning class! This tip is just food for thought for people who aren't a fan of morning classes but could technically handle one.
* **It's okay to drop a class**. It's important to deal with challenges in life, but sometimes you show up to class just a few times and realize how unreasonable the workload or professor is. If the class isn't required for your major or you can take it another time with another professor, drop it! You don't want one thing to make your entire semester miserable. Also, if you drop a class within the first week or two you avoid getting a W on your transcript.
* **Map out the classes you plan to take each semester during your freshman year**. To do so, get familiar with general education requirements and the required courses for your major. Most advisors will be happy to help you with this if you ask them. You can also reach out to an upperclassman in your major since they know which classes they took each semester.

***\[2\] Academics- How To Succeed In Your Classes***

* **Read the syllabus**. First, you avoid wasting your professor’s time because you asked a question outlined in the syllabus. Second, you get a sense of course expectations, assignment descriptions, and due dates early on. Sure, you won’t memorize every single detail or due date by reading it once, but you can always refer to the document as needed.
* **Spend money on textbooks wisely**. Please don’t buy any textbooks until you are absolutely sure you need them! In other words, you must go to class and hear from the professor that the book is required. If you end up needing the textbook, here's what to know: Unless your professor requires an access code, try to find a cheaper version of the book. Amazon is a good resource because they have a wide selection of textbooks and often allow you to rent or buy e-books. E-books have many advantages: they’re generally cheaper than physical books, don’t take up space, and it’s easy to find certain terms using the search feature.
* **Don’t skip class**. Not going to class once is like a gateway drug – after that, it’s easy to justify not going whenever you’re tired or just not feeling it. The only exception is when you’re really sick and can’t focus on the lecture anyway.
* **Sit in the front during class**. Sitting in a spot where the professor can easily see you will make you more likely to be attentive. Also, professors think more positively of students who sit up front since they tend to be studious.
* **Be respectful to classmates**. You're not the only person going to class, so please make fellow students' experience as conducive to learning as possible. Eating in class, talking to friends, and asking the professor too many questions are a few ways you may distract your peers. Refrain from such behaviors, as you wouldn't like it if someone did it to you.
* **Figure out your note-taking style(s)**. Will you take notes with a pen and paper, a laptop, a tablet, or a combination? There are many factors to consider, including but not limited to:
   * Will the class involve calculations or diagrams that require pen and paper?
   * Can you handwrite quickly and neatly enough?
   * Can you type quickly enough?
   * Can you avoid the distractions of a laptop or tablet?
   * Can you afford a tablet?
* **Study your notes after each class or review the notes from all your classes at the end of each day**. Doing so reduces the stress brought on by cramming the night before, and it helps you retain information better because you’re reviewing it regularly.
* **If you have assigned textbook readings, read them before and after the lecture**. Before a lecture, reading the textbook familiarizes you with the content. After a lecture, reading the textbook serves as a recap of the lesson, and it also reveals confusing topics that would be helpful to go over during office hours.
* **If you’re struggling with the material, get help from your professor during office hours.** No matter how small your question is, it’s better to get it answered early instead of letting everything pile up right before an exam. You also start building a connection with your professor, which will help you later down the road – check the “Extracurriculars” section for more on this.
* **Avoid using your phone or other distractions until your work is done**. The more time you spend on distractions, the less time you have to do work. Also, even if you “only” spend 10 minutes doing something else, you end up losing more time than that because it takes time to refocus on the task at hand.
* **Start projects early**. You don’t need to complete the whole project the day it’s assigned; just work on a bit each day to start, and as the deadline gets closer increase the workload.
* **Know how to handle group projects**. Whenever you can, work with just 1-2 people you trust, as coordinating schedules with fewer people is easier and it's less likely you'll have to deal with a terrible group member. Make a group chat with all group members and get in touch with each other soon after the project is assigned to discuss responsibilities and a list of deadlines. Even if you don't get to work on the project yet, having these expectations upfront will help later down the road. Whenever possible, make sure you can all work on the project without needing to meet at the same time. If it is necessary to meet at the same time, at least try to do it via Zoom so people don't have to worry about making it to a certain location at a certain time. Use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com) to figure out when the most people are available! Once you have gotten together with the group, use your time together wisely by getting to work right away. Many people fear group work because it becomes a bad experience whenever certain members refuse to do their fair share of the work. Definitely try to reason with such members first, but if they don't budge or are unresponsive to communication in general, don't be afraid to ask the professor for help.
* **Always do the extra credit**. Even if you're doing well in the class now, there might be a tough assignment or exam later in the semester that lowers your grade.
* **Make at least one friend in your major**. That way you can support each other academically. Reviewing material together is often more enjoyable and can help you truly grasp the content by “teaching” it to someone else.
* **Let your professor know about any personal issues going on in your life**. If you (or a loved one) are going through mental or physical health issues, are in a tough spot financially, etc. let your professor know. Even though they can't help directly, they'll be more understanding when you don’t submit the best work or need extra time to complete assignments.
* **Keep in touch with your advisor.** Some people might show up at college knowing exactly what they want and how to get there, but most students still need some type of guidance. Talk with your advisor about how classes are going, what activities you want to get involved with, what you want to do after graduation, etc. Advisors can give you practical advice about these topics, especially if you reach out to them early.
* **Check out academic support resources offered by the university**. Depending on the university you attend, there may be centers that provide general study tips, math help, writing help, and so on. Ask your advisor what services your college offers. They’re “free” because you pay tuition – use them!

&#x200B;

***\[3\] Organization & Time Management***

* **Find out where each class is located in advance**. Instead of scrambling to find your class on the first day, walk the campus the day before to learn how to get to each building and room. Pay attention to long it takes to get from one location to another so you know when to leave to get to your destination on time. This is especially helpful if your campus is big!
* **Get around campus efficiently**. If your dorm is far from most classes, don’t come back until the end of the day; instead, find spots to study close to your classes. This is particularly useful when the weather is bad and you want to spend as little time outside as possible. Also, even if your campus has buses, actually using one tends to be inefficient because you’ll probably spend more time waiting for it than it takes to get to your destination. Save the bus for bad weather when it’s not practical to walk to class.
* **Use a digital calendar and to-do list**. Google Calendar can be used to mark academic events (e.g. when you have class, assignment due dates, exam dates) and non-academic events (e.g. work, clubs, social events). Reminder apps such as Todoist are great for smaller tasks we tend to forget if they aren’t written down, such as making a phone call. I know iPhones have a designated Reminder app and I’m sure other smartphones do too, but I prefer Todoist because it has more features, such as allowing you to create subtasks within a task.
* **Avoid having unreasonably high expectations for what you can accomplish in a day**. It’s better to put fewer tasks on your to-do list and add more, rather than add too many and get upset if you can’t get everything done. Maybe you would love to study for three tests, work a 5-hour shift, hang out with friends, go to the gym, and attend a club meeting all in one day, but this might not be possible. Learn to prioritize what needs to get done.
* **Stay disciplined**. Although some aspects of your schedule like classes or work shifts are set in stone, you’ll still find “empty” blocks of time on weekdays. Make sure you use this unstructured time wisely by designating it for important tasks like studying. That way, you can get work done efficiently and then have the weekend to rest, hang out with friends, or review the material.
* **Keep your physical workspace neat.** Focusing on your studies is challenging when your desk is filled with things that are irrelevant to what you’re doing at the moment. We often place items on our desk when we’re lazy or don’t know what to do with it, so start being mindful of this. When you put something on your desk, always ask yourself if there’s any better place it could go. I know dorm space is often limited, but just try your best!
* **Organize your computer.** Even though there it’s not physical clutter, having a disorganized computer still makes productivity difficult. Avoid having too many unread emails, place important emails in designated folders, save bookmarks for commonly-used websites, create folders for each class you’re taking, keep your desktop neat, and so on. 

&#x200B;

***\[4\] Dorm Life***

* S**tart making a college dorm supply list early**. It can be overwhelming to figure out what you really need for your dorm. To minimize the stress, start creating a packing list at least a few weeks before you leave, writing down some of the most essential items to bring. To do so, check out packing lists online and see what things are listed repeatedly. Then, go about your days and take note of everything you use on a daily or otherwise regular basis. Also consider what problems you might run into at college and what supplies you would need in such cases – for example, what will you do if you get sick, when it gets cold outside, etc.?
* **Be a respectful roommate**. Even if you don’t do unequivocally bad things like bringing unannounced guests or turning the room into a pigsty, your habits may still annoy someone else. For example, if you like calling friends or family in the room often, some people find it distracting. Ask your roommate what they don’t like and try your best to accommodate their needs within reason.
* **It’s okay not to be best friends with your roommate as long as you get along**. In fact, it’s better not to be super close so you have the motivation to branch out and make new friends.
* **Always try to sort out conflicts with your roommate before escalating things to the RA**. Many roommate disagreements are minor enough to be sorted out between the roommates. By doing so, you learn how to deal with interpersonal conflict, which is an important life skill.
* **Your RA is not just there to help you with roommate issues.** RAs receive extensive training on how to help peers have a successful experience on campus, so reach out to them if you’re feeling homesick, having a hard time making friends, struggling academically, etc. Even if they can’t help you directly, they will find the best resources for your situation.
* **Don’t sit in your room all day**. It might be easy to spend time in your room whenever you don’t have class, but it prevents you from exploring all that campus has to offer. Also, your roommate may need personal space sometimes and that isn’t possible if you’re always around.
* **Do laundry when things aren’t too busy.** Laundry rooms tend to be pretty empty when most people are sleeping (early in the morning), afternoons at the start of the week (Mon, Tues), and when people are going out (Friday or Saturday night). On the other hand, afternoons at the end of the week and Sundays are generally busy. It’s also a good idea to scope out your specific laundry room to see when it’s the most or least busy. Another tip: stay in your dorm while you do laundry to catch up on homework or perhaps tidy your room since you’re already in the cleaning mindset!
* **Always take your keys and lock the door**. Do this whether you’re going to the bathroom for a few minutes or will be gone the whole day. The people on your floor may be perfectly trustworthy, but you never know for sure.
* **Decorate your room at least a little bit**. Even putting up a tapestry or some fairy lights will help make your space more cozy and relaxing.
* **Don’t go home every weekend or call your family all the time**. College is meant to be a stepping stone to living completely alone. Make sure you can be without your family while you still have thousands of people around you for support.

&#x200B;

***\[5\] Extracurriculars***

* **Start making connections with professors as soon as you can**. You can do so by participating in class, asking follow-up questions after class, and asking them about their research. Knowing at least 2-3 professors well can provide you with quality job references and strong recommendation letters for grad programs and/or scholarships.
* **Get involved in a professional and just-for-fun experience – at least one of each**. Professional experiences include research or a job/internship related to your major. Having this under your belt allows you to obtain valuable experiences and soft skills you can discuss in an interview. Just-for-fun experiences include clubs or intramural sports. These allow you to take a break from school while doing something enjoyable and making friends.
* **Sign up for a bunch of clubs at the start of the semester**. Join the email list for each club that sounds remotely interesting, and then you can decide whether you truly have an interest in that activity or are free when meetings are held.
* **Get a part-time job on campus**. There are many benefits to working: You have money to spend on “fun” things like going out or ordering things online, can start saving for the future, and improve your time management skills by balancing work with school. I recommend doing no more than 10-15 hours a week, though it’s possible you have such a busy schedule that you can’t work at all. As far as getting a job, most colleges have a portal with on-campus job listings – find out how to access and use it. Many students end up at a dining hall or do some type of office/administrative work. Generally speaking, dining hall jobs are easier to get but require more hard work, while office/administrative jobs are harder to get but give you some time to catch up on homework. A few tips for getting a job: If you don't get an invitation to interview within a few weeks of submitting your application and there was a contact person listed on the job description, follow up with them. Since many people don’t do that, it’ll make you stand out. Also, many colleges offer resume critiques and practice interviews that make you a better applicant, so find out how to access this help.

&#x200B;

***\[6\] Social Life***

* **Take advantage of the first few weeks during the semester when everyone is looking to make friends**. If you see someone sitting alone in the dining hall, ask them if they’d like some company. If your dorm has common areas where people hang out, chat with someone there. If you arrive to class early and see a classmate, strike up a conversation with them. Whenever you come across situations like these, ask the person their name, their major, where they’re from, how they’ve spent their time at college so far, etc. Then invite them to join you the next time you go to the dining hall, library, or another public space on campus. If you were friendly during the initial interaction, they are likely to say yes.
* **Say yes if anyone offers to hang out**. Even if you don’t like them at first, they might end up being really nice! This is particularly important if you don’t know many people yet.
* **Be prepared for unique opportunities to make friends**. Being in the same major, class, or club are excellent ways to meet new people, but they’re not the only ones! To use a personal example, once I got locked out of my room and couldn’t text my roommate since my phone was still in there. I ended up borrowing the phone of a girl in my dorm lounge and we became friends.
* **Don’t let your past social life set you back**. Even if you were socially awkward or disliked in high school, you now have a fresh start! There’s no way everyone can know each other, especially if it’s a big campus, meaning you won’t have the reputation you did back in your hometown. Even if you end up not clicking with someone, there are plenty of other people to meet. Likewise, if you were embarrassed about your interests or personality back then, keep in mind that college is a much more diverse place so almost everyone can find like-minded people to connect with.
* **Once you establish some friendships, make plans with someone at least once a week**. Whether you grab food, study, or go to an event, it’s important to have some type of regular social support. With that being said…
* **It’s perfectly okay to be alone in college sometimes**. No one will judge you for eating alone at the dining hall or walking to class by yourself. In fact, spending time alone is great for personal growth and ensures you don’t rely on others for all your happiness. 
* **Quality over quantity**. This saying holds true for many things in life. In this case, a few friends who’ll be there for you in times of need is better than 20 fake friends.
* **Be smart with your money.** Going out or ordering delivery with friends is fun but try to keep it as a reward rather than a weekly (or even more often) occurrence. Also, consider getting a credit card to start building credit, as long as you’re responsible with it and avoid debt! Tell yourself that the credit card is just like a debit card, otherwise you'll fall into the mindset that it's ""free"" money.

&#x200B;

***\[7\] Health & Wellness***

* **Get enough sleep**. Health experts recommend getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night, but if this isn't possible try to get 7 hours, or 6 at the very least. Sleep is so important for mental and physical health, and it leads to better academic performance. People who get enough sleep usually find it easier to learn new information and review old information. Though some people seem to get by just fine when they pull all-nighters, for the vast majority of people getting adequate sleep is the best way to do well academically.
* **Try to eat 3 balanced meals a day**. If you don’t have time for breakfast in the dining hall, at least have snacks you can eat before you head to class. For lunch, eat a meal that includes carbs (ex. rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) and veggies. For dinner, eat some carbs and veggies, plus some protein (ex. chicken, fish, beans). I know it’s tempting to just eat grilled cheese and burgers, but that should be an occasional treat rather than a daily occurrence.
* **Stay hydrated**. Drink something with every meal at the very least, and then anytime you’re thirsty. Water is best but tea, coffee, or juice is okay too. Consume sugary drinks like soda in moderation.
* **Work out when you can**. Even if it’s hard to get to the gym 5 days a week, you can still incorporate physical activity into your life in creative ways. For example, walk as much as you can, do stretches in your room, run up your dorm stairs, go on jogs around campus, arrange weekend bike rides with friends, etc.
* **Make your mental health a priority**. Taking a few moments to take a deep breath, meditating, having social support on campus, and reaching out to family back home are a few ways to maintain your mental health. Having a relaxing nighttime routine by listening to music, reading a book, or doing another activity that calms you is another great idea, as the time before bed is often the only time you don’t have to rush to be somewhere or do something. In general, maintaining mental health requires you to learn what works for you while recognizing when you might benefit from professional help like therapy.
* **Spend time outside**. Most college campuses are beautiful and have lovely places to study or relax outside. It really depends on the specific college you attend, but simply walking around campus for a few weeks will help you discover some of the best outdoor areas to spend time.
* **Tackle your fears**. Everyone is afraid of different things, but no matter what they are it’s important to face them head-on. For example, I used to hate calling on the phone, but then I got a job on campus where I had to call people regularly and my fear of the phone was reduced. Remember that getting out of your comfort zone is about more than learning to cope with a particular fear – it also does wonders for your entire self-esteem and motivates you to strive for success in all aspects of your life.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vw3u15/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_i_started/
1b1m8ue,"College wasn't enough? (USA, BS in CS)","College provided a foundation and taught me the basics of programming, but that was really it. Lessons were basic, projects were basic and straightforward, and I only *actually* got to build something meaningful in my senior year. However, it was so far along in my education and only lasted one semester, so I never got to really dig in and truly learn anything of retainable substance.

Now that I'm actively applying (and suffering - 300+ apps, 0 interviews) for jobs, the vast amount of knowledge and experience needed for positions is absurd, and I NEVER would have gotten all of what an entry-level position is requiring today in a classroom. The gap between real-world positions and what I learned in college is worlds apart.

Now, of course it goes without saying that it's my fault too. I should've spent more time learning on my own outside of class, but between taking classes/focusing on passing and enjoying my actual life, I didn't. Now, I'm paying the price.

I'm utterly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of knowledge I *don't have* but NEED to be able to land even the most entry-level position. I'm truly entry-level in terms of skill, and I feel like I'm so unbelievably behind that I can't help but freeze. I don't know what to do, what to learn, how much I need to learn, etc and I feel as though I'm running out of time with every passing day since I graduated last May.

Pardon my rant, but I'm just so *lost.* I have no idea what company would even give me a chance with the knowledge I possess (and don't possess).

Is it just me???

**EDIT** (9hrs after original posting time): Thank you to everyone who's replied and given their thoughts. I want to clarify a few things.

I take full responsibility for my shortcomings and I don't want to make excuses for my inability to find a job as a result of the market, college, or whatever else. I know that *I* am the problem. Trust me, I know. In the time I spent working towards my BS, I was clueless as to the extent of what I should have been doing outside of class to prepare myself for the real world. I ignorantly focused solely on my classes thinking that they were enough. So, **the point of this post was to express my dismay that no one ever told me otherwise**. My professors never (or very rarely) encouraged us to work on projects outside of class, find and dive into technologies not taught in class that interested us, etc. I'm not blaming them, just sharing my experiences.

With that being said, I have been working on certifications in my free time as well as learning different technologies to build better, more complex projects. Like I said, I'm responsible for the position I'm in, but I'm actively working on trying to get on track and be a little better everyday.

ls5idn,"To the professors that email students who are falling behind to check “how they’re doing”, thank you.","Admittedly, this semester has been rough. I’ll keep it short, but home life, work, mental health, weather, etc. I know others have it worse, but I get overwhelmed.

I’m falling behind in most of my 5 courses this semester. Still better than last semester though. I thought about taking a break but it’s my last year and loans and everything...I figured I’d just stick it out.

Anyway, my professor messaged me yesterday with the subject “Checking in”:

Dear ______,

How are you doing? I'm writing to check in with you. I haven't heard from you in this class yet and I'd like to connect with you to figure out how I can best support you. These are difficult times and I'm more than happy to be flexible with the course.

Let me know if you want to chat over video or phone, or just check in through email.

Best,

1dbrl1k,PointYeah.com CEO Threatens University Student's Project     ,"Hello Reddit community,

I'm a computer science student reaching out during a challenging time. I created a project, FlyMile pro, a flight search engine that finds flights on credit card points. Originally designed to enhance my resume and secure internships, it surprisingly attracted over 10,000 sign-ups!

However, recently, I've been facing some distressing challenges. The CEO of PointsYeah has accused me of scraping their website, a claim that is entirely baseless (I have my GitHub commits, my code never interacted with his site). I hadn't even heard of PointsYeah until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon a mention in a Reddit post, Despite this, I received a message threatening to shut down my site (see message screenshot).

Last night, our website was bombarded with an unusual amount of traffic, which seemed like a deliberate attack, and I've been receiving calls from random international numbers. I even found MilesLife - his previous company having payments issues with merchants - I will not comment anything on that, you are free to explore.

I’m feeling quite overwhelmed by this, especially since this project was meant to be a positive addition to my learning and future opportunities. I've worked hard to create something useful and educational, not just for myself but for a broader community.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to manage these accusations and protect my project?

I get that it’s helpful to commiserate, get advice about problem students, etc. But I just want to offer the counter narrative that our students are generally really great. When I am totally overwhelmed from the workload or frustrated by unreasonable asks from the administration, the only thing that keeps me going is sharing class time with my students. Anyone else genuinely like their students? It would be nice to see some positive stories when everything else in the world sucks.

1l229pa,Can we protect against recording?,"Red state. Large university. (First time on Reddit hope I’m doing this right.) Students use AI to take notes for them and some additionally record lecture. This is worrying.

(1) on the recording and AI note taking, worried that I say something I’ll get inadvertently reported for, but now there is “evidence” and it’s unclear what all is being policed. Not teaching evolution or politics, but hard to know what will piss off a student and state now has a way for students to report faculty saying things they don’t like. 

(2) if students aren’t busy taking notes, most tend to not focus on class at all and are distracted by devices. Tried flipping lecture to video but they mostly don’t watch and come unprepared even when an assessment tied to it, or they don’t like being assessed on reading/videos and just stop coming altogether, which means I failed at least a quarter of them mostly because they stopped showing up.

Some success with active learning, but some just won’t participate and wait to be given answers or let one student do all the work, so they’ll just sit there and do nothing or get their devices back out. Probably students think oh AI will do it for me later so I’m only here to get the attendance points. That tends to work for early assessments I tell them are practice / checks, but not later and then they fail or barely pass. I show them graphs of how many fail, but that doesn’t seem to impact behavior. 

The recording lecture part now makes me nervous, but the AI listening to my lecture part especially is throwing me off. I get using AI for a meeting to take minutes. Feels so invasive in the classroom and I hate that what I say in class is going directly into the AI. I guess I’m just looking for advice if you’ve also been feeling overwhelmed by these issues.

1hch30f,When your PhD viva feels like a personal attack,"I want to share my recent experience with my PhD viva, which turned out to be far from the celebration I had hoped for. To provide some context, my PhD was in a highly opinionated field: taxonomy. There isn’t a universally accepted way to define species, so it's common for people to have differing opinions, which they express at conferences and meetings. Typically, these discussions are civil, as we all understand we’re working towards the same goal, and rudeness is rare.

Unfortunately, my viva experience was a nightmare. I encountered a few factors that made me feel belittled and overwhelmed, leaving me with lingering negative emotions.

1. One of my examiners was particularly obnoxious and rude. He kept asking me questions that had no definitive answers, repeatedly interrupting me to insist I was wrong and that I should have known better.

2. Whenever we discussed a results chapter, he claimed he would have approached it differently (which is fair), but he also questioned why my supervisors allowed me to take that route. This made me feel like every chapter was flawed and worthless. I know that’s not true; as a postdoc, I collaborate with researchers around the world who appreciate my work. I’ve presented my findings at both national and international conferences, and they have always been well received, even though my work is often controversial.

3. At one point, he said he couldn’t understand how my paper was approved for publication in a respected, peer-reviewed journal because he thought it was terrible.

4. Throughout my PhD, I applied a significant amount of mathematics to biology, but he seemed to struggle with this concept. He claimed that biology and mathematics don’t go together. What?! Math applies to nearly every aspect of life, especially in fields like bioinformatics.

To sum it up, I was always told that a PhD viva is meant to be a discussion about your work. Instead, mine felt like four hours of criticism, where I was made to feel wrong and ignorant. I passed with minor corrections, but I feel defeated. I feel like a fraud and dread announcing to anyone that I’ve earned my doctorate. It feels undeserved, and all I want to do is cry.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hch30f/when_your_phd_viva_feels_like_a_personal_attack/

He straight-up said he doesn't have such time! The only times I can go to him would be to ask a question he can help with; if I just want more ""face time"", he's not willing. The cherry on top was his finisher: if I really cannot deal with it, I should find someone else. 

I'm not really sure if, after 2 years, I can find someone else. I might as well apply to a different program. Yet I'm counting on my salary, and side quests I can run in the city (context: I'm a serious musician). Quitting means I should just go back to my sanctioned futureless country, where neither my past education nor music is going to help. 

I've decided to talk to a counsellor, so that I can persevere; yet I'm not sure if this person would give a solution other than that I should find a change.

1fzxcab,Embarrassed about my PhD taking long (in my 9th year now),"I’m doing my PhD in biomedical engineering in USA. I started in 2016 straight from my bachelors, did rotations until about 2018 where I found the project I was working on in a very small lab with basically just me and the PI. I applied for an NIH training grant in 2019. I didn’t get it and when I was trying to collect preliminary data to reapply with a new aim to address one of the concerns, covid stopped it and I was basically forced to not apply. During covid things were real slow. I had some personal factors like discovering about my adhd around 2022 and starting a serious relationship in 2021 and got married last year - which planning for was a huge distraction. I’m trying to get things finalized to publish two first author papers,  and then defend but I’m super overwhelmed and stressed with how much I still have to do to finalize everything.  Because I don’t have a date for when I’ll be done and no publications to advertise myself for post doc positions - I feel like I shouldn’t even try yet. At conferences or seeing peers or professors I’m super embarrassed/insecure about saying what year I am or when I’ll be finished. I’m trying to find data online about median and std for completion times and I know I’m not the longest ever, but still when I tell people at a conference they look at me in shock and tell me to get out already.

Edit: At this point it feels like I should just push to publish and graduate next year before the fall instead of rush too much, so I’ll have more time to apply and get those papers fully published.

1mytmr3,Gaslighting admin…,"I think I’m being gaslit by my DH and I’m so over it. The year before I came to my current institution, the department had some very significant upheavals (I won’t give details, it was in the national news). My first year I focused on developing my courses, doing the service I was specifically hired for, and getting a jump on my research (mainly because they outgoing DH didn’t understand a d*mn thing about pedagogy and it was my way of ensuring he couldn’t force me to give into student whining). I was assigned a student org but it had fallen apart in the year of upheaval. I didn’t know any students to get them involved and the current “exec board” didn’t return emails or schedule org meetings and I just de-prioritized it and worked on what I believed to be time sensitive needs. 

ETA paragraph: my first week I had found a student that was supposed to help me get it going (ironically enough the new “president”) and emails with the then president. At the end of the year after multiple emails to schedule kick off meetings I was ghosted. I finally got another student to step up and agree to be president this fall but then 3 days before the semester he backed out because he moved up his grad date and couldn’t do it. 4 days after that is when I was asked about it by DH. So back to original content….

Cue this year, new DH new priorities. He emphasized the importance of the service role I was hired for and said he wanted to take it one step further. I told him what I needed, resources and timeline, to make that happen. Crickets since the. So I’ve just been plodding ahead on that project. Sticking a pin in things I needed his input or approval and doing things I could in the meantime. 

The first week of classes I get asked about my student org. I say “it doesn’t really exist and I’ve been focusing on other things”. He says he wants to move forward. Cool I can do that, so I specifically go to his office and ask what he would consider an acceptable level of completion by the end of the week (student welcome where we cover the student orgs). He tells me just some information about it. Great, so I don’t need to choose a president by the ? No. Can I go ahead and schedule a call out meeting? Yes. 

I put together the information and schedule a call out meeting. Get to the welcome and a student announces in front of everyone, he is the president. I ask about it and he got a call from the admin assistant 11:30 the night before asking him to take over. I ask the DH about it. He says he has a timeline he’s working on and if I’m not going to meet that then decisions get made or something to that effect. I asked, ok but that’s why I specifically came and talked to you. At that point he kinda brushes that off and eventually says “it’s lunch time, I’m not discussing this”. I said ok and walked away. Madder than, well pretty much anything. 

I emailed all passive aggressively (but not the immediately shit listed/fired level) apologizing for the complete misunderstanding and I can’t figure how I completely misunderstood everything he told me and asking for very clear deadlines on the other things I had been working on so I could better prioritize. 

His email back to me was crap, didn’t address the issue and most definitely did not admit he f*cked up and either A. Forgot our conversation or B. Doesn’t respect me at all and thinks I can’t do my job. 

So, in my experience admin never take responsibility, but this is this guys first year here, my second. If this is how it’s going to be, I know it will be hell. A friend is a DH in another department (their first year as DH) and was trying to justify his behavior but I just can’t buy it. This isn’t typical “he’s first week, overwhelmed and had to make a decision”. He straight did the opposite of what he told me needed done.

um8fmv,Been mostly lurking in the “college” subreddit lately and the term “mental health” is used over and over as a reason for failure.,"I understand that people have mental health struggles. I’ve had my own struggles with anxiety and depression throughout my life (and still today) but I keep seeing the same post from countless students that their “mental health issues” are the reason why they failed a class or out of college entirely. 

While this may be related in some way, I feel like (at least some) students use mental health as a scapegoat for their lack of accountability and then are angry when professors don’t bend to an unethical point to get what they want. 

It’s so bothersome to me as a person who has never used my own struggles as an excuse ever in my academic career. 

I’m also growing increasingly concerned about this for two reasons. 

1. Those students with true mental health issues may fall through the cracks as instructors and support staff are overwhelmed with an increased number of students making these claims.
2. In knowing this, it makes me concerned for future conversations that I may have with my own students, where my ability to feel empathetic wanes with so many requests. 

I’m pretty structured, though I try to be reasonable. I also know I’m not a psychologist and the appropriate departments are always notified when I feel that a student is at risk.

Fourth year: You get over the hump, but fall into ""I don't give a shit anymore"" valley. Not crying as much anymore, but also not getting as much done because the apathy is strong.

1fgo4gs,I want to quit,"TLDR; 6 weeks from defense in a miserable PhD in a field I hate, want to quit. Overwhelmed, behind on writing, and worried weak dissertation isn’t worth the effort of finishing/defending.

I am, allegedly, 6 weeks from my defense. I have been miserable every second of this degree. I wanted to quit very soon after starting but I couldn’t bring myself to. I have felt like a really bad PhD student because I have such a lack of interest in my field in general. I hate it, actually. I convinced myself the money would be worth it in the end because I could land a job outside of my field in tech with the PhD skills like many of my PI’s past students. The issue is, I feel like I didn’t learn much because I hated my work so much that I have just avoided it and done the bare minimum. Honestly, I’ve probably been doing less than that given how behind and unprepared I feel this close to my defense. On top of that, the job I have lined up is IN my field, just at the PhD level. So, that’s not exciting either. 

I don’t think my PhD is very defendable, honestly. 2 of the chapters are published, which in itself was shocking enough to me. But the rest of it is absolute garbage. ESPECIALLY this last chapter. It’s poorly designed and poorly executed with not great results. I take blame for part of that, but also my advisor has some too. This last chapter itself could’ve been my entire PhD, but I didn’t even know what my thesis title was until a little over a year ago, right before my quals. I felt like for my whole PhD I was throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks and then trying to string it together into a coherent narrative. And sometimes it seems like my advisor doesn’t realize how much work certain things are. I’ve made so many horrible assumptions and had to cut corners on things because the level of detail for this to actually be worth looking into was too much for one year. Especially since I had to collect additional data while also trying to finish writing this fucking thesis.

I didn’t come to grad school wanting a PhD. My PI suggested it to me while I was a Masters student. I was unsure but he got my attention by mentioning how his previous PhDs make more money than him because they went into tech. He said he had a project in mind for me and so I begged him during my masters to let me start and I could do a masters thesis instead of the capstone track, so I can see if research was right for me before committing to PhD. He refused and just kept blowing me off telling me to focus on my classes. He kept telling me he thinks I’m “built for this”. I am, in fact, not. 

Needless to say, I have a whole lit review chapter that needs to be written, and have to finish up these last two chapters as well as a short discussion. All in the next 2 weeks so I can send the draft to him a month before the defense. I have been working tirelessly sitting at my desk, not going to the gym, not keeping up with my hygiene, and still barely getting anywhere with the writing because there are just so many issues with the actual project for the last chapter I keep running into.

I want to quit. Cut my losses and just leave. I’ll be jobless because my employment is contingent on me receiving my PhD, but I am not sure I care anymore. I just want this hell to be over. This last year I’ve worked so much on my mental health and got to a better place but it feels like it’s all coming crashing down as this approaches. Idk if I have it in me to write the probably 40 additional pages this is going to take. I hate this field, I hate my project, and honestly, I am genuinely incompetent when it comes to this field. I just want this to end.


Edit:

Thank you everyone for your kind responses! It really helped me not feel alone. After having a small mental breakdown and a nice shower cry lol, I decided to give myself a little break, as I am overstressed. I think I overwhelmed myself comparing to other PhDs. Instead of aiming to meet their specific page counts or do things exactly the way they did, I’m just going to do what fits MY PhD. My advisor will let me know if it needs revisions and I will have time to address those as they come, rather than trying to do more than I may even need to.

1m1hp5b,Not proud of my PhD,"I am defending in a month (STEM) and I feel very unsatisfied and a bit embarrassed of my work. I believe I will defend successfully, the results are new and insightful, but when I look at it all I see are the things I would do differently knowing what I know now. I spoke to some colleagues who have defended and they couldn’t relate, they were just happy to have it done. Is this a common experience?

The primary source of my anxiety is in the data collection method. At the start of my degree my supervisor was very against a method that has now almost become standard. I knew relatively early on that this might end up being a problem, but I 1) didn’t want to negotiate with my supervisor and 2) was a bit overwhelmed and not using this method seemed the easiest course. Compared to the research that is coming out now with this more in-depth data collection method mine feels outdated and simplistic. I had a meeting last week with a researcher who wants to do a similar project as mine, but with the new method. I was invited on for my raw data and expertise on that data, but I couldn’t help but feel like an imposter.

I have severe imposter syndrome. I was supposed to look for postdocs a year ago, but I felt anxious about finishing my dissertation and didn’t feel good enough to apply. So now I am in a stressful situation of looking for jobs, but I feel extremely depressed and unmotivated even though I am taking a break from the lab right now; I will go back to continue some of the work for a manuscript. I guess my personal life context: I am a foreign student, and my family (back home) is trying to marry me off asap and for them my phd means nothing since they don’t really care if women have careers. 

Currently I am applying to a bunch of jobs but I am overwhelmed with anxiety because of my family and also with the current funding situation & immigration. So I am wondering if I should apply for postdocs in Canada or Europe. 

I usually see a counselor, but they haven’t responded to my email after we took a break for my defense. I don’t know what to do right now. When I began my PhD, I was super enthusiastic and curious about research. However, now I feel like phd was a waste of my time.

Sorry if this is the gazillionth post on this subject. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1jd8xyi/defended_my_phd_and_super_burnt_out/
xlmrrk,Student was in fact three different guys.,"This happened during the pandemic, I was too overwhelmed to even think about posting it here, but it came back to my mind recently and I think you’ll enjoy that one...

We were half-online/ half in-person when it happened. I’m very good with names and faces, but at that time, it was all a blur mainly because I did not see them as often as prepandemic and also because of masks and turned-off webcams. 

There was this one student who would always « forget » his identity card for the exams. It’s suspicious because where I am, ~~it’s illegal to go out without one form of identification~~ (Someone pointed out this is not correct, but anyhow, students are expected to show proof of identity with their exam). He had no college card, no drivers license, nothing to confirm that his name and face were belonging to the same human. 

Then I realized that the person I saw the day of exam 1 did not look at all like the profile picture in my files. I thought: puberty hit extra
hard on this one...Still...something felt off.

Exam number 2 comes by and he does not have his card (again!). I explain that no grade will be issued until he is able to prove he is the one registered for the course.

Later that day, I remember that I have recorded video of him (it was for an assignment) and another audio file from another homework. Well, on both recordings, the voice is different, with speech patterns that are undeniably belonging to two different persons...that are clearly nothing alike the guy who shows up for the exams.

I contact the appropriate admins and send them what I got. One of them just replied 
« What the fuck, are you sure? »

They tried to call, email and meet with the student but he ghosted everyone.

tye1ze,"Chronicle Headline: ""Stunning Level of Student Disconnection""","The Chronicle ran a piece today under the title [""A ‘Stunning’ Level of Student Disconnection""](https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-stunning-level-of-student-disconnection) that echoes many of the stories shared here in recent months. For those without access, here are some highlights:

**"" “My students are struggling to focus within and outside of class,” wrote one history professor at a public university in Georgia, who, like many respondents, asked to remain anonymous in order to speak frankly. “They feel overwhelmed and pressed for time. They cannot separate the existential dread of Covid and now Ukraine from their daily ability to live.” ""**

 **“Students seem to have lost their sense of connection with the university and university community, and their sense of purpose in attending,” said Stephanie Masson, who teaches English at Northwestern State University, in Louisiana. After two or more years of masking, they feel as if it’s not OK to get close and talk to someone. “It’s almost like they just prefer to sit in their little cone of silence.”** 

**“I can’t seem to reach this group,” wrote a music-history professor, after describing how she uses low-stakes assignments that include detailed instructions and group work in class, intended to prepare students for an open-book take-home exam. That worked in earlier years, but not now. “I’m trying to be accommodating with extending deadlines, giving personal invitations to office hours and appointments, and more,” she said, “but, honestly, it’s feeling like they are just not interested in doing the work. I get it. I’m also exhausted.”**

The solution, the article argues, is the widespread adoption of student-centered experiential learning pedagogies. Yet many of us who have done so-- or who have been doing so for years prior to the pandemic --are still seeing the same problems with student engagement. So the silver bullet some recommend in the piece is at best suspect.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/tye1ze/chronicle_headline_stunning_level_of_student/
1ll2952,ASYNCHRONOUS CLASS- BEST PRACTICES WELCOME HERE,"Hello fellow peers!

I hope everyone is enjoying their well deserved summer!

I'm trying to but i also have a new asynchronous prep hanging over my head and I have lots of questions. This is a course i've taught for forever so thankfully the material is all familiar but i dont quite know how to adjust it in regards to timing spent on each thing.   
  
Id love some advice on your best practices or what some game changers are for you when teaching in this form. We have a great CETL dept but unfortunately they don't provide much on how to effectively teach asynchronously...  
  
Ive read through previous reddit posts on our page so i've started to gather some ideas but if anyone has answers to these specific questions that would be wonderful:

1. Do you leave assignments open all semester or do you have locked in dead lines as you would in person? For those with deadlines, do you have a late policy?

2. How do i know how many actual hours of work my assignments will take? I know they should be doing 150 minutes or so of actual work each week but does that mean i should be timing out exactly how long my recordings are/ it would take for them to complete assignments ? Or am i overthinking this..

3. Do i have the modules open by the week or do i just allow them to open up once all assignments are completed from the previous one?

4. Do you have a suggestion for how to record lectures and share them? We use brightspace and have minimal software additions so i was thinking recording via zoom and then uploading unlisted to youtube?

Thanks in advance :) 

Edit- I am overwhelmed  with everyone’s responses. Thank you so much for really taking the time to offer best practices.  I’m so glad I posted this because for the first time since decided to teach this, I feel less anxious and excited to implement some of these things. 

Thank you all again!!
Enjoy your well deserved summer!",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ll2952/asynchronous_class_best_practices_welcome_here/
1i20rrd,Curious phenomenon: Students refusing to ask for extensions,"One semester, when all things seemed wrong with the world, I decided to give some extra grace to students feeling overwhelmed: one free, no-questions-asked extension on any assignment.¹

*One* student, just the one, in all my classes, asked for an extension that semester—on the very first, low stakes little paper assigned just to gauge student abilities, and she retracted her request when I asked if she wanted to use her ""freebie."" She never asked again.

If any student even hinted at not making the deadline, I'd offer the free extension. Nope. They wanted to save it. The students who would have lied and begged for extensions otherwise just started meeting or missing deadlines without sending any emails.

This generosity, a clearly explained *addition to* rather than *replacement of* normal extension policy, seemingly caused an artificial sense of scarcity and led to hoarding behavior of a (wrongly) perceived limited resource.

What a time saver this became! Highly recommended. Give it a shot and let me know if it works for you; if it does, it suggests a subject for behavioral research.

1e0bz07,I've Had Enough,"I'm sorry for posting a shitty downer rant. It just feels a little better to write all this down.

I genuinely feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. I just started M3 year. Barely passing clerkships (my school starts them early, I've had four so far). No friends at school. Spend every weekend alone. Every research project I was on tanked. Struggle to work out twice a week. Feel miserable constantly. Unhappy and anxiety ridden daily. Only multiple-day strectches I've felt happy in the past year have been 1) the week I visited home 2) the week I visited my college town 300+ miles away. Have had many days, weeks, and at one point a whole month where I was genuinely, clinically depressed. Nobody cares enough to ask how I'm doing and actually listen if I express even an ounce of doubt in myself or the circumstances.

I try to hope that residency will be better but I'm even losing that after hearing ""yOu tHiNk iT's hArD noW JuSt wAiT for rEsIdEnCy"" every single day from higher ups.

I want to match into psychiatry, but it's so competitive now. Dreading residency rejection or STEP failure but I'm simultaneously, secretly, wanting it so I can finally stop kidding myself and leave medicine. At least twice a week I'll stop in disbelief, reflecting on the fact that I left a career in tech just so I could ruin my life pretending to be a doctor.

""Take a leave of absence""

""See a therapist""

""Try a new hobby""

""Go make friends! Host an event!""

""Treat yourself""

All tried and failed, or cost money that I don't have. Medical school is a wash, praying I survive this and life somehow radically changes afterwards but I doubt that more every day.

Edit: Y'all I am overwhelmed by the positivity and support in comments and in DMs. I assumed 99% of reddit posts get ignored and didn't expect a couple dozen folks to hop on my digital diary. The comradery, advice, and encouragement actually made me feel miles better today. Thanks to you all, and good luck future doctors!

Edit2: Update for anyone who finds this post later (or those who come back to it, for whatever reason). I've really been riding the emotional waves the past couple months, but things are looking better. I just got my first two interview offers for residency and passed the FM shelf. After hitting these milestones, taking more time to work out, going to bed earlier, and binging Bojack Horseman: I've been able to back away from the ledge and am feeling a lot better. **You all were right: it DOES get better**. It gets better faster when you adjust your attitude/outlook, too. It took me two years to realize how much harder school has been because of my bad attitude. Keep working hard and reach out to others when you're feeling overwhelmed (this post, for instance, wound up being a huge morale booster for me).  **However, don't let yourself wallow. It is truly a waste of time.** ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1e0bz07/ive_had_enough/
1kbbo73,Failing course due to undiagnosed illness,"The month of march was my downfall. I started slacking with submitting assignments and assignments that are worth most of my grade. It is now the last week before final week and I am only passing one out of five classes. I was diagnosed as a type one diabetic last week Thursday. This explains the extreme fatigue I’ve been experiencing. I’ve been wondering if it is worth doing all the assignments and then explaining why I didn’t submit my work, or if I should just accept that I failed this semester. I worked hard to bring my gpa up just for it to flunk because of an undiagnosed illness. I’m so stressed it feels like I can’t breathe. I’m so tired but I can’t sleep and I’m too scared to start my work. I know if I don’t at least ask I’ll regret it but I feel as if I should at least have the work done beforehand. I just have no time. I literally only have till Friday to finish all of my assignments. And I’m not on campus since I’m being monitored at home to make sure I am taking my insulin correctly. I have a doctor note  but idk I’m just so overwhelmed. It feels like the universe is against me. I am so tired. I know it would be better to talk to my professors in person but I cannot, it seems as if it is harder for show empathy when they haven’t met their student (my classes are online). I feel as if it would be best and better communicated if I explained in person, but I cannot since I am not on campus. I just don’t know what I should do anymore. 

Edit: 

Okay so I’ve talked to my professors and I’ll be able to pass three classes. They granted me an incomplete so I’ll have more time to submit my work. The other two I failed I will be retaking. One I am retaking in the summer (easy pass since I have all my old material) and the other one I’ll be retaking in the spring. 😁

I did not want to medically withdraw because I am starting my nursing program in the summer. I am supposed to graduate next year in the fall. I appreciate all the help though! ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1kbbo73/failing_course_due_to_undiagnosed_illness/
1msvlc6,I hate the concept of 15 signals,"I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed with my program list. I’m applying to general surgery, and honestly, 15 signals just doesn’t feel like enough. The idea makes sense in theory, but with so few signals, it feels risky. If you misjudge (over or under estimated) your competitiveness, you might not end up with enough interviews to have a solid chance at matching. And if everyone is signaling the same “attractive” programs, then the pool is still crowded, so even qualified applicants might miss out. I wish they had increased it to 30 signals, so that even if you only get half the programs to send you interviews you’re still at that 90% or so probability of matching based on your number of interviews. With 15 you’d have to hope all the programs you signaled will interview you.

Residency Explorer hasn’t been helping my anxiety either. Most decent programs only interview about 30% of applicants who signal, unless it’s a less desirable program based on location, reputation, benefits, or opportunities. My advisors tell me to apply to around 60 programs in addition to those 15, but I keep wondering what’s the point if signals seem to matter most. Even my home program expects a signal to show we’re serious, which only adds more pressure and less room to increase my chances of interviews outside of that.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1msvlc6/i_hate_the_concept_of_15_signals/
1lgw51b,"Failed my first year, need to pass upcoming exam","I've failed my first year of med school and will have to repeat this year. I also studied medicine abroad for a year beforehand, which I failed as well. The content itself isn't too hard but I just find myself so overwhelmed with the amount of content. I cannot concentrate in lectures for the life of me and so I just stopped going. In the exam I do alright on the questions I do answer but there is always around 50% of questions that I cannot answer because I did not cover the content and have never even looked at the topic before. Every single exam I fail by around 1-4 points. At this points my parent have given up and tell me if I can't pass next year I'm going to have to choose a different career path. I understand the concern and I want to prove them wrong so bad, I know I can do this if I pull myself together but I just don't know how. I am always so distracted, I have never been that good at listening to lectures/ teacher my mind always switches off but I've always been good at self-studying. I've had some personal hardships happen as well and I just can't get myself to sit down and learn. When I do revise I get through the content well enough. Please give me advice/ motivation or tips on how to learn. I have my last exam of the year in 4 weeks and I want to prove to myself that I can at least pass an exam. I really need this win. 

Fyi my current study hours: often less than an hour a day, but have tried my best to pull through and have done between 3-4 the last 2 weeks. 

I also know this makes me sound really lazy, please believe me when I say I want this and I am willing to put in the work.

Right now, I'm in a program called Sustainable Systems Management, which is an interdisciplinary program made up of business, environmental science, and engineering courses. The only reason I didn't go for civil engineering was because I barely passed calc I + II and chickened out of calc III. Needless to say, I'm INSANELY regretting my decision, as it's too late to switch. If I could go back in time, I would've gone for civil engineering 100%.

I'm also dealing with some mental health problems. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder this year, and my therapist suspects that I have ADHD. Between this and all of the switching of majors, I have a 2.8 cum GPA (which is lowkey super embarrassing because I graduated with honors in high school). 

I have literally been giving myself anxiety attacks and insomnia over this regret + what my entire future will look like LMAO. If anyone has any good life advice or literally anything to snap me back to reality,  I'd really appreciate it!

18ipc2w,Something needs to change in how we help students with anxiety/ burn out.,"Ok, I heard one too many times this term that students were unable to hand in assignments or write tests because they were feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work they had in other classes or that they are too anxious to get the work done.  I get it, it's a lot. I know mental health is bad. Never in my 5 years of teaching have I had this many students contact me 2 weeks after an assignment was due asking if they could still submit with decrease or no penalty.  It's not fair to students who get it in on time. It's not fair to me.  

I know anxiety makes you procrastinate. But here's the kicker- procrastination and avoidance makes anxiety worse!  So we are actively increasing anxiety by giving extensions.  

So when do we put it back on the student to drop a course rather than bend over backwards and into pretzels handing out extensions? Isn't this the most reasonable, responsible, and honestly healthy way to approach it?  If you are overloaded, decrease your load. Don't ask others to carry it for you. This is how we help them learn the life skills they need.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18ipc2w/something_needs_to_change_in_how_we_help_students/
1hofq1o,Academic hazing?,"I've been at my professorship at a large university for almost a year now, and am still overwhelmed and anxious at what's expected.  I came from a largely industry-creative background (was never a TA or adjunct) and had naively expected there would be a training/on-boarding period where I'd be instructed on how to develop a syllabus/course plan, observe how teaching is carried out over term, and know best practices in terms of grading, addressing attendance, and some of the more philosophical tenets of higher education.  NOPE.  The on-boarding was brief, largely inconsequential, and at best let me know where to park and who our football team was playing that weekend.  I was turned loose on the students, neither of us really sure where things were going.  

I've addressed my feelings of being overwhelmed and anxious with a few colleagues in and out of the university system, and it sounds like this is pretty much standard modern-day academia: build up a massive CV, go through an intensive day of presentations and interviews during the screening process, then suck it up and just teach yourself day-to-day with lots of crash and burn (in front of a live studio audience) until you ""get it.""  Someone said this is typical for 1-2 years, which wasn't really motivational for me to hear.

That all said, I don't feel like I'm being treated any less or differently than others who've been hired from similar backgrounds, it just floors me that in any other job I've held, training and skill-building was done ahead of the expected duties.  I've lost sleep, had panic attacks right before and right after class, and am often feeling rudderless as I try to navigate my next course.

I tend to follow through with things once I’ve started, but I also worry constantly, which makes it difficult to walk away, even when I know it’s not right for me.

The interview didn’t give me the impression that there would be room for growth; it felt more like, “Here’s what the job is, take it or leave it.” That has stuck with me.

1jfx94x,Multiple Absences But Don't Want Consequences,"So here is my rant for today because I am angry and fed up. There is attendance policy for the entire school and we are able to craft our own in our individual departments. The rate of excessive absentism has gotten so bad over the years that even the Deans and Dept Chairs are tired of ""grandma or grandpa"" dying once a semester or twice. Without documentation within a certain time frame you cannot be officially excused. Now that we have gone past Midterm, all failing students are overwhelmed and more concerned about their excessive absences.

What I am angry about is how you can cover the Absence policy in detail, explain the damn consequences and have students to sign a contract, and yet they do not want the policy applied to them or they want you to tell them before they hit the ""magic number"" that they have messed up. I am nobody's personal assistant or secretary. 

The LMS is open and transparent. But hell they don't even read the comments you leave as feedback or announcements.  Or I did not see that announcement and my favorite is, "" I don't think I should be penalized because I have a good excuse. Or I put in for an excuse from Student Affairs but then it never comes.

I am truly upset because students are lying more than ever on professors in attempts to play ignorant to make you look like the ""bad guy"" when they are withdrawn or dropped a letter grade after being gone 2 months, 7 or 6 days and you have documented it, until your fingers bleed blue. Then it's ""you can't do this to me and ""I am going to the Dean, not realizing that Dean approved the Attendance/ Absent policies before they entered the school. I just wish the LMS would drop them automatically when they reach X number of unexcused absences. Anyone else tired of this nonsense?",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1jfx94x/multiple_absences_but_dont_want_consequences/
q8qbqg,I Got 7 New Grad Offers: The Sequel (and tips that worked for me!),"Hello again r/csMajors! Some of you may remember me from my [incorrectly titled post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jgt7ce/i_got_7_internship_offers_a_long_summary_of_my/) where I received ""7"" (eventually 9) internship offers. After that whirlwind of a recruiting season, I was expecting to have a more laid-back time this year, especially with a return offer from my internship under my belt.

I submitted 41 applications (most of them as a joke) vs my 120+ from last year, sat back, and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of responses I got, so I decided to make another Reddit post.

**About Me:**

* Senior @ large state school (can tell which one by my post history, again)
* Double majoring in CS & Business Analytics
* 3.3 GPA (higher than last year thanks to open notes exams...)
* Two internships, a part time tech support job, 2 leadership positions (VP of one club, director of another) at school, 2 projects
* US Citizen

I tried to do a Sankey, but that quickly got confusing because this time around, a few of my interview processes were through the CodePath career fair & my prior recruiting contacts (I attended Grace Hopper but it only barely helped this time around, mostly because I was being selective with the number of interviews I was doing). So here's some quick facts instead.

**Quick Stats From This Year:**

* **Applications Submitted: 41**
* **Offers Received: 7 (JPMorgan return offer, IBM, VMWare, Asana, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, NBCUniversal)**
* **# of Resume Rejects: only one** (thanks Duolingo)
* **# of Total Rejections: 15** (mostly after OAs & interviews)
* **Interviews Done: 20** (including first rounds & finals)

**Notable Moments:**

* **Rejected from Hubspot after final** because it was my first ever System Design interview and I hadn't studied, oops...
* **Rejected from Microsoft after final** because one of my interviewers insisted my answer was wrong... when it was right... and the code ran with the correct output... whatever. No hard feelings!
* **Visa did 4 technical interviews, and then asked for a FIFTH one** so I finally turned them down.
* **Rejected from Facebook after first phone** because it was my first interview of the season and I hadn't interviewed anywhere in a year.
* **During my VMWare final interviews, one round was entirely systems/OS/networking questions. I'd never taken a systems class in my entire college career.** Even though I answered ""I don't know"" to every question, and had to explain why I didn't take Systems/OS to the interviewer, I still got the offer somehow?
* **Got sent the Google snapshot. I didn't do it. Recruiter reached out to me asking me to do it. I ghosted the recruiter.** I was absolutely exhausted after interviewing so much & Google's process is known to take FOREVER. Freshman me would probably slap current me if she knew though.
* **Asana's final round was the longest I'd ever done, at 5 hours & 15 minutes, and because of time zones it ended at 9 PM my time** but it was also the most enjoyable interview process I've ever done, even when it was so long & ended relatively late.

If anyone's interested I can add a list of every single company I interviewed with this fall in an edit, but since I only applied to 40 places the list would be kind of short. I also don't want to ramble on like I did in my post last year!

**Tips for recruiting?**

* For full time (or even 2nd/3rd internships), **""warm"" email any recruiters you talked to in the past.** Especially if you got far in their process last time, they'll probably be willing to take a chance on you again (make sure to re-introduce yourself if it's been a while). With Facebook I failed the first phone for their internship last year, but I emailed my recruiter this year and his response was ""I was meaning to reach out to you again, just apply and I'll send you the first phone scheduling right after"" so you literally never know.
* **Programs like CodePath and Facebook's ABCS really helped me.** Why? Because I study better with concrete goals/homework and other people, in a class-like setting. Facebook's ABCS is very well suited for sophomores & juniors seeking internships. CodePath's advanced technical interview prep class is suited towards full time since they cover a bit of system design. CodePath is especially great because their homework is directly assigned from Leetcode, and if you don't do it you get kicked from the program. Finish it all, and you get access to their invite-only career fair with 50+ companies. Pretty good incentive to Leetcode if you ask me.
* **Get your application in front of human eyes as quickly as possible.** Even if its not your actual application, visit the company at a career fair or something, and if you get the chance to talk with a recruiter, tell them you applied and are interested in their opportunities -- they're more likely to go and check at your application after. This is how I got ""un-ghosted"" -- talking to recruiters at GHC and the CodePath career fair.
* **SOFT SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT.** If you know how to solve a problem but can't explain your reasoning clearly to the interviewer, they WILL be confused. I think that's what cost me the Microsoft interview this year -- see above, I probably didn't explain my correct solution well enough. On the other hand, though, I can't count how many times I was absolutely clueless during an interview, but my communication & honesty saved me -- see VMWare above.
* **If you're job searching for the first time, get your resume reviewed & PUT IT THROUGH A PARSER.** Human feedback is definitely the first step, but after you quantify your descriptions and find a good layout, put your resume through a site like [jobscan.co](https://jobscan.co), VMock (offered by some schools' career centers), or even the few student-made parsers I've seen on this subreddit to see if it accurately determines your major/experience etc from your resume.
* **Studying for System Design? Use the** [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)**.** I didn't pay for Grokking, the primer had everything I needed to pass Asana's system design portion. If only I'd studied it for Hubspot...
* **Remember, you only need one offer.** It was definitely discouraging to me as an underclassman when I saw people picking between every FAANG and Citadel, but remember if you're starting out, all you need is that first company to give you a chance. Having choices is great (and sometimes scary) but even a single offer & nothing else can open a LOT of doors moving forward, so once you get that first offer letter, pat yourself on the back! You made it through a bunch of filtering to get there, and now the only direction you can go is even higher :)

If you've made it this far, you may be wondering **which offer I accepted** \-- I'm not gonna take up any more space on this post, so **check out my flair on this subreddit for your answer ;)**

Besides that, if anyone has questions about anything related to internship or full time recruiting/handling offers/my experiences/etc, **feel free to ask in the comments and I'll be answering as many as I can!** Since I've gotten 17 offers total in my time at college, I've pretty much done it all at this point so I want to give back and help all of you out too :D thanks for reading!

\--

Brief Edit: After signing my offer this morning I accidentally walked straight into a trash can on the way to class; the comments about trash cans are all my friends hahah

Edit 2: I've been told that the CEO & founder of CodePath reposted this Reddit post on his LinkedIn, which is so unexpected but also very cool. If you're coming from there, hello!",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/q8qbqg/i_got_7_new_grad_offers_the_sequel_and_tips_that/
1bdil7c,Didn't match to categorical gen surg spot and I'm devastated,"I did match to a prelim spot at my home institution, so I don't have to SOAP, but I'm more concerned about what's gonna happen after my prelim year.

I certainly wasn't the best applicant in terms of Step 2, grades, and research, but my advisors thought I'd be okay, and I applied mostly to places where my stats were compatible, lots of community programs. 

I ended up doing 20 interviews and I genuinely thought my chances were good to match to a categorical position. On the interview trail, I was frequently complimented on my personal statement, LORs, and experiences. I prepped a lot for interviews and I think they went well, so I feel like the issue was my stats. 

I'm gonna work hard this prelim year, strengthen my application, try to network, and re-apply, but I'm overwhelmed at the prospect of going through application season again and terrified I won't match a second time. I'm so embarrassed and telling my family and med school friends was awful. I promise I have resilience, but currently I'm unwell, crying uncontrollably, having a hard time getting out of bed or eating or doing anything.

1la0rke,Struggling with criticism from lab mates,"
Hi all,

I'm 2 months into my PhD and currently feeling very overwhelmed. I'm a fresh masters graduate doing independent research for the first time. My immediate lab mates are M (4 months ahead of me) and S (1 year ahead). I rely on them a lot because I'm new to this field and doing these experiments for the first time. I usually confirm the experiment steps with them, including basics like which lab to go to, which materials to use, where to find them, etc. since the papers don't provide detailed instructions which I first need to start off my work.

Today, M and S gave me a 45-minute feedback session where S just pointed out all of my mistakes and M just listened. This hurt me especially because M and I sit next to each other, have lunch together and try to make weekend plans (they dont work out because something or the other gets in the way). S went on about how I don't plan experiments properly, how I ask too many questions even about the basics, etc. S would start off by asking me some questions about my confidence in certain techniques, and when i said ""i think so"", she just said ""no, i dont think so"" and continued listing out my errors. The entire experience shook me - 45 minutes of just listening to my mistakes with no feedback or improvements or empathy. A few hours after this, I cried in the bathroom. The minute I reached home, I called up a friend and bawled. I'm feeling very humiliated, demotivated, and underconfident. For a while, I was thinking that I am not cut out for a PhD because I didnt expect all this to happen so soon. I knew that a PhD would be difficult, but I did not expect this behavior from my lab mates. I dont know if its normal or not. I'm feeling hopeless and lost.

To make things more confusing, M had suggested I start an experiment today (Friday) that would include a Sunday time point, but then M and S later told me I hadn’t planned properly, without checking if I had permissions and confirmed I had all the reagents and materials (I did have permission and the reagents).

Now I’m nervous about upcoming training sessions with them on important instruments. I want to get better and more independent but feel stuck between asking for help and fearing judgment. I’m also considering talking to my supervisor about this but worry about making things worse. I'm very lost because M and I have related experiments for our first objective and I really feel bad that they didn't check in on me after the talk.

I'm looking for tips/advice on how to navigate:

- Building independence and confidence when protocols aren't clear and I dont feel safe enough to ask questions

- Dealing with harsh feedback without it affecting my mental peace

- Should I bring this up to my supervisor without giving namesl

- Is there any way I can subtly let M or S know that while I appreciate their intention and feedback, this is not the way to help someone?

Thank you in advance. Any advice or tips would help me a lot.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1la0rke/struggling_with_criticism_from_lab_mates/

1i89lc0,Why starting yoga was the best thing I’ve done since starting med school,"TLDR - Try a hot yoga class

—

This post is gonna be a bit ramble-y but I just wanted to share this story because it has been completely transformative for me and I hope it helps someone else who is in a similar position that I was in

—

For context, I am a current M2 beginning to study for STEP while also finishing up my school’s pre-clinical curriculum. I really enjoyed M1. I developed some fantastic friendships, was running 4-5 times per week, and was feeling like I had a great “work-life” balance. As M2 began, I started to feel VERY overwhelmed with school/research and at the same time there was some tension developing in my friend group that weighed on me a lot. I was able to handle it, but just barely. Then, late fall I got injured and was no longer able to run which was the only form of exercise that I enjoyed. I absolutely despise going to the gym because I am unable to turn off my brain and I just find myself thinking about school. 

Fast forward to the holiday break and I had a slew of family health issues arise that took a massive toll on my mental health. Within 2 weeks I went from having a totally healthy family to multiple family members in the hospital and found out that someone very close to me got diagnosed with cancer. While I was still trying to focus on school, it was essentially impossible to have that balance that I used to. I stopped spending time with friends, ruined my sleep schedule by staying up way too late worrying, started severely abusing caffeine to get me through the day, and completely stopped exercising due to my injury. Needless to say, I think I met more than 5 of the SIGECAPS criteria in addition to a significant level of anxiety that I have developed over the past few months. 

A couple of weeks ago, a couple of my friends DRAGGED me to a hot yoga class. I was super resistant and feeling really negative about it until I got there. I am pretty out of shape and the idea of yoga was not appealing to me in the slightest, let alone hot yoga. 

During that first class, I felt more relaxed than I have been in months. I was actually able to turn off my brain and just focus on that moment. I had never done yoga before, so honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I didn’t know it would be such a workout. After that class, I had the best day of studying I think I have ever had. 

I spoke to the studio about a student discount, and they were more than happy to accommodate what I was able to afford. I have been going every day since. That hour of peace, quiet, and exercise has completely changed my day-to-day life in so many ways. I am now able to be far more efficient while studying. I am feeling less distracted, more awake, less anxious, much happier, and I am sleeping significantly better. Because I have been more efficient studying, I have also been able to spend more time with friends, which has also really improved my mental health. 

Moral of the story - let your friends bully you into going to yoga, even if you think you can’t do it. I cannot express how grateful I am to have found this outlet. Yeah, this might sound dramatic, but honestly, going to these classes every day has been the best decision I have made since starting school. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1i89lc0/why_starting_yoga_was_the_best_thing_ive_done/
1lo9tzr,I finally did it!,"I did it, guys. I can’t believe I made it to the end.

It’s been a bloody road. I’m not just talking about the PhD, but about being a father to two little toddlers, a husband trying to do his best for his wife, a son trying to make his parents proud, a faith who keeps rising and falling, and a student who never fits in academic environment, but still kept going.

I’ve been struggling. I’ve felt depressed, overwhelmed with mixed feelings. There were times I wanted to give up. Times I woke up and felt like I had to go to the lab. Times I didn’t even know what I was doing. Times I wanted to stay here forever, and times I couldn’t wait to move on to the next project.

I’ve been sad, happy, distressed, pressured. I’ve been through ups and downs, broken and recovered, often not in sequence, but all at once. And I survived it.

Nothing is bad in the end. Everything works out, and all you really need to do is keep going. Keep doing what you believe in, and eventually, you’ll reach the finish line.

17rdxzm,Advice for help with student prone to meltdowns,"This is not my class, but a colleague is having trouble and has asked around for help. I'm wondering what ideas other professors may have.

There is a class here that has a lot of field trips, where students are taken to various points around the state. The longest drive is 2 hours. Without getting into specifics, you can think of it like the equivalent of marching band, where there is a biweekly trip built into the schedule.

We have a student who is prone to severe meltdowns. Now, in the classroom setting, this is not usually an issue, because when they feel they are overstimulated, they know to leave class and come back. This has worked pretty well.

The problem comes from these trips, which are a required portion of the class. For most of the drive, which is in a modest van, the student occupies themselves with YouTube on their phone, which is great... except when it doesn't. We're in a rural area where cell reception is ass most of the time. And when cell coverage is lost... the meltdown began.

From what my colleague, the meltdown consisted of screaming and cursing and flailing to the point where safe driving was impossible, so they pulled over to a gas station, where the screaming and cursing continued. My colleague was uncomfortable resuming driving. They did not miss their appointment, but it was close, and it made the entire trip extremely uncomfortable.

We all feel so unqualified in this situation, and disability services is understandably overwhelmed. The only accommodations is extra time on tests. The student could really use an aide with them, but we were told to hire a work study.... which, is a 19 year old any more qualified?

What is ideal to do in this situation with no outside support?

1kfsdm1,"Is it normal to fall behind on reading papers your advisor sends you, or is it just me?","Hello, I'm currently a graduate student and I'm wondering if my experience here is typical and relatable to others. 

So, my advisor sends me papers that he finds fairly often, probably every other week or so. I usually just pin the email, download the PDF, and add it to my notes document under a section titled ""Papers To Read""... but I don't actually read the entire paper until a long time later. I might skim it quickly to see the plots my advisor wanted me to see, but I don't read it in detail right away. And then, theoretically, sometime in the future, I will spend a couple weeks doing *nothing* but reading papers. 

I have to admit that I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of papers I have on my ""to read"" list, plus the mental effort/time it takes to read and *actually* understand even ONE paper is very daunting. I want to read the entire thing and take notes on it as well - highlight the important parts, and summarize its key findings and equations in my notes document - so that I can keep everything I've learned organized. And doing all this for one paper could take an entire day. I know they say ""just read the abstract and look at the figures"", but if I don't do all this, how will I actually remember what I've learned? 

I have something like 20-30 papers on my list of papers I intend on reading, either ones my advisor sent me, or ones that I found but didn't feel like reading fully at the time. 

I was just wondering if this experience is something you all relate to. Please let me know if this is relatable and tell me about your experience - for example, how often does your advisor send you new papers, and do you read them right away, or fall behind?

q7n636,How do you cope with students going through the worst sh*t.,"I spent Monday on several zooms with students that are going through... just unbelievable, unbelievable shit.

Yes, I have students that are just assholes who don't want to learn.  But oh my god, Zooming with some students really brings it home.

Spent an hour with a student who is freaking out because a neurological issue that came from an accident last year is rearing its head again.  Her problems used to last a few hours, and she's scared because the latest bout has lasted two weeks.  She tells me what the spells are, but I can already tell - she is having serious trouble talking.  She woke up Sunday morning and couldn't walk.  Her mom is bringing her meals and she feels horrible about it and said ""I give her everything I have because I make her so sad --  I give her all my food stamps because of everything she's doing for me.""

She could barely open her eyes because they were so swollen from crying.  She can't navigate the health care bullshit that this country makes you go through.  To top it all of, the hospital called while we were on the zoom which she was doing on her phone, and she didn't end the zoom call on time and the hospital hung up.  She can't get in touch with her doctor.  

She says she was a bad student in high school, but when she lost three family members in 2018 (grandma was a natural death, a cousin was killed, didn't tell me how her aunt died) she decided to change her life. Now at college, she's never gotten less than a B, and she says she can't give up.

She is miserable.  She is powerless.  And she broke me. I told her all the things I wanted to tell her other than ""GIVE ME THE DOCTORS' OFFICE'S PHONE NUMBER AND I WILL FUCK THEM UP IF THEY DON'T GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU!""  But I didn't.  I did say I'd try to find out if the school has a patient advocate or if the Office of Accessibility could help.

When I ended the Zoom I just sobbed.

Two hours later, I hop on another zoom.  This student has is losing her housing.  She's been talking to everyone at our school because she says ""the school has a lot of resources.""  She's right.   

She's not crying, she's really taking charge of stuff - but she felt bad because she didn't hand her work in on time and didn't want me to think she's slacking off.   She's a confident gal and is one of my best participants in the class.  She's a joy.

But I couldn't get over it that night.  The worst shit I dealt with in college was boyfriend trouble and juggling working at a bagel shop while also going to classes.

Never worried about food stamps and brain damage.

Never worried I'd lose my housing.

Is this just an NYC thing?  This city is so, so, so cruel to the poor.   I'm at a community college so I have students that are in very precarious situations.

I just don't know how to be okay with telling them I respect them and that everything will be okay.  Don't get me wrong -- Just yesterday I told a kid who complained that he was ""overwhelmed by all the work he has to make up"" after not attending 6 weeks of classes that essentially it was tough shit for him.

1lgwkpb,I think my BA thesis is complete garbage...,"Hey...

So, my thesis is due in 3 days and I started writing pretty late. I'm basically done at this point, I'm just editing and fixing up some things now but every time I re-read my paper I just think it's a pile of garbage. I don't even feel like handing it in because I think it's that bad... I mean in the end I will hand it in obviously because I finished it and that's the important part I guess, but I'm just worried that I will fail and then all this work was for nothing and I have to do it again. This cost me so much mental energy and I'm just so sick and anxious of it, I just wanna be done with it finally... I did put it through some AIs because I don't have anyone to proof-read for me (I started too late and the one appointment I did manage to get with my supervisor before it is due was cancelled x-x) and it said it's pretty good but obviously I don't trust an AI to tell me the truth, lmao. So I'm just... ugh. So overwhelmed at this point.

1la0465,Struggling with criticism from lab mates,"Hi all,

I'm 2 months into my PhD and currently feeling very overwhelmed. I'm a fresh masters graduate doing independent research for the first time. My immediate lab mates are M (4 months ahead of me) and S (1 year ahead). I rely on them a lot because I'm new to this field and doing these experiments for the first time. I usually confirm the experiment steps with them, including basics like which lab to go to, which materials to use, where to find them, etc. since the papers don't provide detailed instructions which I first need to start off my work.

Today, M and S gave me a 45-minute feedback session where S just pointed out all of my mistakes and M just listened. This hurt me especially because M and I sit next to each other, have lunch together and try to make weekend plans (they dont work out because something or the other gets in the way). S went on about how I don't plan experiments properly, how I ask too many questions even about the basics, etc. S would start off by asking me some questions about my confidence in certain techniques, and when i said ""i think so"", she just said ""no, i dont think so"" and continued listing out my errors. The entire experience shook me - 45 minutes of just listening to my mistakes with no feedback or improvements or empathy. A few hours after this, I cried in the bathroom. The minute I reached home, I called up a friend and bawled. I'm feeling very humiliated, demotivated, and underconfident. For a while, I was thinking that I am not cut out for a PhD because I didnt expect all this to happen so soon. I knew that a PhD would be difficult, but I did not expect this behavior from my lab mates. I dont know if its normal or not. I'm feeling hopeless and lost.

To make things more confusing, M had suggested I start an experiment today (Friday) that would include a Sunday time point, but then M and S later told me I hadn’t planned properly, without checking if I had permissions and confirmed I had all the reagents and materials (I did have permission and the reagents).

Now I’m nervous about upcoming training sessions with them on important instruments. I want to get better and more independent but feel stuck between asking for help and fearing judgment. I’m also considering talking to my supervisor about this but worry about making things worse. I'm very lost because M and I have related experiments for our first objective and I really feel bad that they didn't check in on me after the talk.

I'm looking for tips/advice on how to navigate:

\- Building independence and confidence when protocols aren't clear and I dont feel safe enough to ask questions

\- Dealing with harsh feedback without it affecting my mental peace

\- Should I bring this up to my supervisor without giving names?

\- Is there any way I can subtly let M or S know that while I appreciate their intention and feedback, this is not the way to help someone?

1kor56c,Totally lost on how (and if) I should be switching from academia to industry,"Hi all,

I am a young-ish postdoc (30-ish) in automation/ control engineering/applied mathematics from a developed country, and I am currently at a point in life where I am struggling to justify the current state of academia.

I feel really overwhelmed by the fact that what seems to matter most is the sheer number of papers one has to publish just to have a shot. This has led me to the realization that I am on the slower side. I need to fully understand any area of the macro-subject I am working with before I can feel comfortable, namely, I have to be able to derive all the tools I am using from a basic set of assumptions.

Furthermore, during my employment, I was never offered the opportunity to tutor students or collaborate with other Ph.D.s. As a result, the menial tasks such as running simulations were always mine to handle, along with writing the main body of the text and the proofs, doing the literature review, and fixing any issues that came up to some degree. Now, in between jobs, with my next one starting in two months, this has finally changed. I have been able to foster some connections. However, it already feels too late to have any decent shot at an academic future.

This situation was not helped by the fact that I suffered from a serious illness last year, which still affects me to some extent, and that the COVID period during my Ph.D. was quite harsh on me. Still, I take full responsibility for not being fast enough.

To make matters worse, while applying for academic jobs, I keep getting replies from professors asking whether I would be willing to play the grant lottery with them without any pay. This only amplifies the bad feelings I have toward the system, which does not help on the motivation front. I do enjoy doing research and tackling real problems, but I can no longer tolerate the many superficial behaviors I see in some of my peers.

So, this year, I decided to seriously try to transition to industry while still maintaining some ties to academia. I know industry is not perfect, but I feel it would open up more options for me once I get in. The pay would likely be better as well, and I would be free from these never-ending one-year contracts with an optional second renewal.

However, it has now been six months and I have not even landed an interview. And this is breaking me.

So I would really appreciate some advice from people with real experience. I would like to ask:
i) How can I better present or sell myself on the job market? (Type of resume? Word over pdf? ...) ii) Am I just being a sour loser, which is how I feel, and will I regret walking away from academia later? Or should I keep pushing forward and postpone the decision a bit longer?

I would really love to hear some honest advice from people who have been through it.

Edit: I used ChatGPT to double-check if there were any mistakes in the text and copied the prompt, too.

1mcisbx,Adjunct Maternity Leave,"I'm sure this question has been asked a lot, but I'm looking for input on my situation. I am 8 weeks pregnant (first-time mom) and just got my contract for the 2025-2026 school year as an adjunct instructor (75% FTE). I was given three classes per semester, which is two classes less than what I thought (basically due to tenure-track colleagues getting assigned courses ""first""). I'm trying to advocate for an increased courseload based on past semesters (I taught 4 classes in the spring and thought I was getting assigned the same ones). Since I'm paid per course, this is a big pay cut for me.

However, I'm also aware that I won't be teaching any of these spring classes - I'm due the first week of March but also found out I'm having twins and will likely have them between 36-38 weeks, 4-6 weeks into the semester. So:

\- how do I advocate for 100% FTE when I'll be taking time off? This feels so contradictory to me - as a long-time adjunct, I really want to both protect my time and secure my place within the department for next year.

\- when do I let my chair/colleagues know I'm taking leave? I am thinking around 13-16 weeks. I'm a little hurt by the lack of communication around my course assignments, but I don't want to screw anyone over by waiting too long (I also don't think I can hide it for long, because twins).

\- should I attempt to teach during the spring at all or take 4 weeks unpaid? I know from coworkers that I can get 12 weeks paid through our university's leave policy + STD/accrued PTO. Previous coworkers have also arranged ""alternative work assignments"" to cover 16 weeks of the semester.

1k5dfgg,Autistic medical student - would IM residency make me miserable?,"I'm an MS3 trying to decide between applying IM and Pathology. I find pathology relatively interesting and love the idea of the path lifestyle, but am worried that I don't feel that true spark of liking the field or will miss seeing patients later on. If I do IM, my primary interest is in heme/onc (or maybe just benign heme). 

I was diagnosed with autism as an adult about 5 years ago. I've always had trouble with reading social cues (accidentally interrupting people, saying something insensitive, not knowing how to respond to people being witty or sarcastic, etc), and with fidgeting/stimming (stretching, cracking knuckles, picking at my nails, etc). Obviously I try to stop myself from doing these things during clinical rotations, but sometimes they slip out. My evals are generally good, but occasionally I rub someone the wrong way and get something like ""She could be more socially aware,"" etc. Basically, Dr. Mel King from The Pitt TV show reminded me of myself in a clinical setting. 

I have a love/hate relationship with seeing patients in the hospital or clinic. On one hand, it feels great when I do connect with people, and it's exciting to apply knowledge to real cases, discuss patients during rounds, etc. In the hospital I feel more focused and interested in what I'm doing. But, I get anxious when going to rotations every morning and before I walk into a patient's room. I sometimes feel overwhelmed and lost when people give me instructions on how to do something (especially something physical with my hands) and it takes me longer to process/understand it. I'm exhausted from the effort of acting normal after every day working in a clinical setting, with little energy to devote to my husband, dog, or hobbies. Idk, maybe that part will get better with experience. 

I'm afraid that IM residency will be even harder/worse than med school clinical rotations in these respects. It's like IM residency is a barrier to get through before I can do heme. (Maybe just benign heme so I don't have to break the news of cancer to patients?)I wonder if I should do pathology, even if I find it a little less interesting than heme/onc, just because the residency sounds a lot less stressful for someone with autism and might not push me to the very limits like IM residency would. 

TL/DR: any thoughts on the feasibility of IM residency for someone with autism?

1mp5on9,1st Year - Fallen Far Behind,"Tldr:

\- Failed every quiz so far (Passing is 70, not even close, below 50%)

\- Extremely behind on course material (Unable to participate in class or study groups)

\- Deteriorating physical and mental health

\- Considering LOA, Withdrawing, or Staying. All options are on the table.

\- Tried academic support. Trying to get counseling.

Hi everyone,

I never thought I would be in this situation, but I have fallen very far behind. I don't think this is sustainable, and I am not sure I can recover from this. My DO school is P/F, so I'm not trying to aim for perfection. Day by day I make small goals for myself to determine what I need to learn and to show improvements. It's worked to an extent, but it isn't allowing me to catch up. I've been told the 1st semester is all about getting settled into the pace and curriculum, but I don't even think I am close. I really am far behind (unable to participate in class, group work, or even study with other peers. Nothing is sticking.), and I take responsibility for that. My study skills need to be improved. It is clear that I got away with things going all the way back to HS.

I did meet with academic support to get help. It has helped, and I have improved marginally. But, I don't think it'll be enough. My health, physical and mental, has not been great, and I actually had a medical emergency right before medical school (we knew it was a possibility due to genetics but it is still extremely rare for it to progress suddenly at my age. Deferring a year was not possible under my med school's policies). I also received some abnormal lab results earlier this year that helped me understand a lot about my struggles in undergrad. I was able to address this and improved my diet, exercise, and wellness. It's frustrating that 7 months of progress have been undone just these past few weeks. I don't want to give up; however, I also have to be realistic, and I am reaching out to you all for advice.

Any help would be appreciated. I've been spiraling and unable to access my school's counseling services. They appear to be overwhelmed, and I get it, but my coping methods are not working now.

What would be most helpful is to be advised on the implications of a LOA and/or staying for the semester. I know we're still early into the semester (our first exam hasn't even happened but is coming up soon). Unfortunately, I would estimate that I only know about 10% of the exam's material (0 pathologies, some pathways to at least get the basic).

I'm open to anything. I've thought about trying to stay and hopefully catch up. Of course this is the best scenario if I can successfully do this. But, I also wonder if it'd be better to withdraw and/or request a LOA. We're still early enough in the semester to get a partial refund. What I don't want is to have to repeat the year anyway or get dismissed. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not cut out for this.

Here's some additional context:

\- You get a Wf if you withdraw while not being academically ""satisfactory"". I don't know if this applies to me. We have a bigger quiz today.

\- We get practice questions and go over them in class. The best I've gotten is around a third correct.

\- I still want to be a physician, but I also am interested in other careers. My lab results and medical emergency really changed my perspective on what I value. I now care most about my health, my friends/family, and happiness.

  
Update: Marginal improvements happened. Based on my circumstances, timing, and advice I received from the school and administration, it doesn't make sense to leave now. School is supportive, which I am grateful for, so I'm gonna give it a go. I might have to take a LOA and/or withdraw at a later date, but I could also come back and develop sustainable improvements. I really want to see this through and give it a go. If it doesn't work out, I'll know I've done my best.

1munuq6,How to stop dreading and avoiding writing papers/proposals,"I've always considered myself a strong writer and have been told I'm a good writer. But now as a grad student, it is the #1 type of task that I try to avoid subconsciously. I find myself dreading it so much and making it up to be such a huge ordeal in my head.

Especially around my niche topic of interest that I've been working on for years. Maybe it's something about that- writing and rewriting about the same things over and over... It should make it easier in a way, but there's this feeling like it's never quite perfect and also not really improving much, and getting tired of hearing myself talk about it. Using the same arguments more than once makes me question myself more and more, and wonder if it was good enough to say twice or ten times.

I also just worry that I won't be able to get all my thoughts out clearly or they won't come together right. I feel overwhelmed by how many different ways there are to communicate things -- The many that I think of and go back and forth on, plus all the others I haven't thought of.

I’m currently doing my PhD and have been struggling with focus and motivation.

The habit is frustrating because it disrupts my flow and creates a cycle of distraction.

Sometimes, I also hit a mental block where I just can't seem to move on to the next idea, though deep down I know I haven’t truly pushed myself yet. This never used to be a problem during my undergraduate studies as I could complete tasks efficiently and stay focused. Now, I feel like I’m stagnating.

I’ve also noticed I avoid progressing because I feel overwhelmed and overly perfectionistic. I get stuck wanting things to be “just right,” which leads to procrastination.

vxqx6t,Thoughts on medical students two weeks into intern year,"So I am almost done with my second week of intern year (though it feels like years have gone by) and I have been having so many thoughts on my experience as a medical student through my new lens of a overwhelmed intern so I thought I would share some of them.

1. I’m so thankful my med students are here. No matter what else you do, if you present even one patient you are taking that off my plate. It seems small but it’s huge.
2. I’m having so much trouble keeping all of my thoughts straight and answering every nurse/patient/family/attending/consultant question while also trying to write notes and follow up on labs etc. My brain is over loaded. I am never purposely ignoring my medical students existence. I used to feel like my residents didn’t like me or resented me because they would just let me sit there and ignore me. Now I’m like I literally block out my surroundings to try and focus on all the tasks at hand. If you need something or have a question please let me know. I’m never ignoring a med student because of anything they did, I’m just trying to survive.
3. If you need something or have a question sometimes I just need to finish an order or finish a thought before I can focus. My med student today said “I have a couple of questions when you have about five minutes” and that was so great. I finished up my orders and then could focus on him. 

I hope this gives some perspective, because I feel like it would have been helpful for me as a third year. I’m really trying to be the resident I always wanted, but as a new intern I also feel like I now have some more perspective on the way residents interacted with me.

The big take away is that even if I seem less warm that i (or you) would like, I’m so so grateful that my third years are with me and I appreciate every tiny thing they contribute.

I entered university fresh without ever coding and my first introductory course was a breeze. It was C++ and all about basics up to arrays. Professor was good and exams involved some coding questions that helped. It was fun until my second semester where we had to take oop in c++. The class was so disorganized and the exams where multiple choice making the class super easy but no learning. All the math classes were fine such as calculus and discrete math and linear algebra. Then we did a class in java which had some dsa but i did not pay attention in this class since I overwhelmed myself with 19 credit hours. No coding on exams and was multiple choice making it easy to pass. This last semester I took Data structures, I was able to learn them all but could not apply them since the exams were all questions such as what is the time complexity of sorting etc and minimal coding was involved.

Now summer is here and I am trying to learn python for interviews and to better my coding skills but don’t even know where to start and feel like I can’t stick to a tutorial as either they are too simple or too complex. 

I read that I should start a project and that will help me. The problem is I don’t know where to start and how to structure the program and how to not rely on chatgpt. I was able to get a project up and running using AI but it defeats the whole purpose.

Additionally, My dad was able to get me an internship a few days ago at his customers startup. The owner told me to review the code before I start and the program is so big that it makes me overwhelmed looking at thousands of lines. He said that they use a lot of ai which i am not sure how to even use with that big of a program to learn.

He also told me that he wants me to cold call people later to promote his company which I feel like defeats the whole purpose of the internship

I just feel so overwhelmed balancing the internship, my full time job and trying to learn and not sure how to prepare for next year.

Any advice is appreciated

If we don't deliver, he doesn't berate us, but you can sense the disappointment. And although he is invested in our thesis research and always willing to help, he is more concerned with finding out what our actual career goals are and prioritizing building skills/contacts for that as opposed to the tunnel vision that working towards your thesis can create.

1m5bulk,Type B+ Educators,"I've heard ""Type B+"" floating around to describe some K-12 educators, but I definitely think there's a lot in higher Ed who fit this personality type as well. First, I think the whole binary ""Type A/Type B, Introvert/Extrovert"" way of organizing people is dumb. I think often people identify with a typology, then pursue behaviors related to it.*

""Type B+"" educators have interesting qualities divorced from Type A/B typologies. It gets its name because it supposedly describes teachers who aren't as high strung or organized as ""Type A"" people, but are more reliable and consistent then ""Type B"" people. However, I don't think it's so much a Goldilocks situation as a different thing entirely. 

I think Type B+ educators are actually just really good at prioritization. Or, at the very least, are very intentional. They don't commit to everything, but what they do commit to they put in at least a baseline amount of effort. Their classes have structure, but also have breathing room. They're willing to hear out students on a case by case basis, but have consistent principles (is the request creating more work for me/unfair to other students). They know that Good Enough is Good Enough when it really is Good Enough. They won't probably go as high as the ""Type A"" people, but also won't burn out nearly as fast and didn't really have the ambition anyway. They aren't as burnt out as their Type B peers, either, because they aren't always playing catch up. 

I'm in my fifth year of teaching and a lot of what I've tried to emulate I realize is from my Type B+ professors. If I don't have ADHD, I do have a lot of the tendencies, particularly around how my brain and body respond to task management. I'm constantly managing how much attention and brain power I'm using to make sure I don't overstimulate and breakdown. Again, it's not about being organized. I know a lot of people, especially in academia, who have beautiful planners and calendars with everything neatly written down who are still wildly overwhelmed because they've taken on too much** or over-value certain tasks; 10 minutes tasks become 30 minute tasks. 

It's tough to articulate. I have two sports analogies if that helps:

The baseball player that is good at hitting not because of power or placement but because they're really good at seeing balls and strikes and putting themselves into good situations so they over perform their ability to actually swing the bat

The ""3-and-D"" basketball player, players who are mostly just really good 3-point shooters and passers who are good enough defensively. Not the best player on the team but very consistent and can sometimes over-perform. 

Type B+ faculty are the ones I've had as mentors and the ones who I most enjoy working with. Curious if others have come across this and can relate?

*Except sibling order. Anecdotally, I think tropes associated to first-born, middle, youngest, or only children play out very consistently.

I’m falling apart quietly. My supervisor micromanages every little thing, and they’ve told me I lack communication skills. The truth is I probably do. I don’t like reading academic papers. I don’t think critically. I procrastinate all the time. I freeze up when I have to present anything. I feel like I’ve faked my way here and now I’m just exposed.

I feel like everyone is overwhelmed by all the work they have to do, but I'm seriously amazed all the time by how little time I spend working on my dissertation. 

I know I'm doing it in extremely privileged conditions: I have a contract and an income (I'm in France), I don't teach any class and never have (never wanted to) so my only official activity is to be writing my thesis. I even got a fourth year of funding! I just keep procrastinating all the time and I think the fact that I have plenty of time doesn't help. I just keep postponing my writing (I have something like one chapter and a half out of five ready by now). 

The thing is that I like my research but there are many things that are much more appealing to me. I climb, cycle, travel, I'm also involved in all kinds of activist and political stuff, so my life is actually very busy... but I can't seem to be able to focus on my PhD and make any sacrifice for it. It's on my mind all the time that I should be working on it but I end up spending hours at my laptop getting nothing done or simply doing anything else, going to the gym or attending a political meeting etc. 

My supervisor is starting to tell me I should get to the writing more rapidly but basically these past few years she has always been very happy with me and never implied that I should work more.

18vwk8i,Struggling with accommodations,"Read my student evaluations, and one of them claimed that they and their peers felt that I didn't respect accommodations. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching as to whether or not that is true, and I think there are a few things I'm struggling with, so any advice could be helpful. 

1. I am teaching a new 4/4 (8 new preps) with ~150 students. About 25 or so have accommodations to different degrees, and I can't always remember who has what. I do have it written in my attendance sheet, but when I'm grading, I don't remember who has late accommodations etc. I am already so overwhelmed and behind that I struggle to keep things straight.


2. My students don't always follow their own accommodations. For example late work at my school requires asking me ahead of time whenever possible and cc'ing the disabilities office. My students almost never do this and just expect to be able to turn things in whenever they want. I don't want to put an undo burden but they also need to follow the procedure.

3. With #2, the accommodations are usually written to imply that students must ask me to use certain accommodations. Students seem to think that they should always get all of them all the time. I'm not sure what to do.

4. I'm seeing some more radical accommodations that I worry are hurting the students. For example, this is the first semester that I've seen students allowed to write fewer pages than required. While I of course allow students to do this, I do express my reservations to them that they will be able to fulfill the prompt in 3 pages instead of 5. I really don't understand this one at all because it's not like I'm assigning arbitrary page amounts. I hate grading writing, so the amount I assign is the amount they need to successfully complete the assignment. 

I've also had students ask to combine two wildly different assignments into one assignment and to not just do entire assignments. I'm willing to work with them to adapt the work, but imo they still need to complete the all of the work.

5. This is the biggest one: my students won't communicate with me. I ask every student with accommodations to meet with me at the beginning of the school year and again when they ask for one of these more radical accommodations. No one ever did. 

I want to help them so much but I also need them to meet the course objectives. I already plan on making an appointment with the disability office when the university reopens, but any other advice here would be greatly welcome.

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the advice and support here. I REALLY care about my students, but I have been insanely overworked this semester.

1mji3l7,Do all grad programs do this?,"Hi everyone, and apologies in advance if my message sounds odd, ESL (used AI in formatting)...

I’m currently enrolled in a graduate program in Mexico. At the end of each semester, every student is required to meet with their research team to discuss the development of their thesis project. This meeting is mandatory and graded by the professor assigned as our academic tutor. Additionally, the academic board requires that this meeting be recorded and submitted to the board chief, a rule I’ve personally found uncomfortable and invasive.

Separately, we’re also obligated to give a public presentation of our progress to the entire academic body (also every semester). This presentation is mandatory but not graded. This semester, I didn’t attend the first day of presentations to watch my peers because I’ve been overwhelmed with thesis work and preparations for my teaching duties (classes start next week).

Today, I received a message from the board chief addressed to all students. It includes a link to an “evaluation questionnaire” that we’re expected to complete, which asks us to evaluate the thematic session of the day with questions such as:

“In your opinion, how do you evaluate the following aspects of the selected thematic area: Organization of the thematic area, Organization of the presentations in the thematic area, Activity of the moderator of the thematic area, Timing of presentations of works in the area, General quality of the presentations in the area” (Likert-type scale)

“Write an integrative reflection on the works presented in the selected thematic area.”

“If you wish to comment on a specific paper presented in this area, write it here (preferably include the presenter’s name and/or the title of the paper).”

I’m honestly confused by this practice. Are graduate students really expected to evaluate how these academic events are organized? Why is this our responsibility?

I’m curious to know: is this kind of student-led evaluation of peer presentations (especially when it’s not part of a research team or a class activity) something that happens at your university or in your country? I’ve always been a bit dumbfounded by this practice and would really appreciate your perspective.

1mgs2a6,Step 2 Anking Workflow,"How do I go about unlocking Step 2 cards in a way that actually feels structured? Every video I’ve watched suggests just unlocking cards in a random order, and I don’t get how that’s supposed to be effective. One card talks about gynecomastia, then suddenly the next one is heart failure. I can’t learn like that. I need to study in a way that flows logically, preferably by system.

Shelf tags don’t really help with that. I also tried unlocking cards based on the “resource by rotation” tags, but that’s been hit or miss. For example, in internal medicine, I noticed the UWorld tag doesn’t line up with the !Shelf tag for IM, which just adds to the confusion.

So what’s the right way to approach this if I want to study in a clean, organized, system-based way without missing content or getting overwhelmed by jumping between unrelated topics?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mgs2a6/step_2_anking_workflow/
1hswhb2,College is forcing me to pay thousands in fees when it’s their fault.,"Long story short:

The portal wasn’t working for 2 weeks for my nursing class. It finally worked by week 3 and they wanted me to complete all coursework for all 3 weeks in one week. I felt overwhelmed and decided to drop the course.

The drop link wasn’t working so I told my advisor and they told me to email the registrar since it’s a bug on the website. 

After multiple emails the registrar finally got back to me in week 7 and asked if I “intend to drop the course”. I said “yes, per my email in week 3 that’s the date I wanted to drop the course.” 

They ended up billing me for 6 weeks of coursework which is thousands of dollars.

I went back and forth with multiple offices. Submitted all emails and all the “advice” from my advisors on how to navigate the drop. 

I was told to send all materials to a payment exemption link who ended up ultimately denying my petition and is still expecting me to pay all of these fees. 

If the drop link was working correctly/if the registrar got back to me promptly I would’ve been able to drop with no fees.

Do I have any recourse? Should I get a lawyer or contact the BBB? 

This is a small private online nursing college.

1ft1o6x,How would you handle this?,"I'm 6 weeks into an 8 week course and I have one student who has turned everything in late. The syllabus says 1 point deduction per day up to 1 week (and not accepted after that) so, she got a 0 for anything not turned in within a week. Now, there is no way for her to pass the course, so she suddenly cares and wants to do something.

What I offered is an extra (ungraded) assignment and if she completes that and takes it seriously AND turns the rest of the assignments in on time, I'll let her makeup the midterm, which should get her to a passing grade. The extra assignment I was thinking of giving her is a personal credibility/behavioral integrity assessment and action plan. The idea was to.give her some tools to manage her work better and tie it to the course topic (ethics). I think there's a decent chance that she phones it in and I don't accept it and she fails the course, but I think it's a pretty generous offer considering I could (or maybe should) just fail her. 

I'm very new to this and I'd just like opinions on how seasoned professors would handle this type of situation? 

EDITED TO ADD: there were extenuating circumstances for the midterm, but not the other late assignments. That's why this exception only applies to the midterm. And yes, if other students needed an extension for an issue, they got it. So, I don't think this rule is unfair to other students. My bigger concern is- do young college students learn this way or do they need to learn the hard way. This assignment is an exercise I give to professionals and have had great success with. But I don't know that an overwhelmed student will see as anything more than an opportunity to do the bare minimum to squeak by.  From what you all are saying.from your experiences, it definitely seems like the latter is more likely. That's exactly what I was looking to learn!

I moved to a local university and I'm honestly scared and intimidated. I start classes in about a week, but I still feel like I just can't do it. I met with my advisor in June and they had set me up for Bio I (with lab), Gen Chem I (with lab), Intro to Clinical Immunology, and College Algebra (I'm majoring in Medical Laboratory Science). All of this totals up to 14 credits. During my time in community college, I once had a 16 credit course load, and I did fine, but they were mostly writing-based courses with one STEM class mixed in. I've been able to keep my GPA a 4.0 so far.

I feel like my success in college so far has been mostly due to luck, and I feel like this semester at uni will show me that and leave me overwhelmed. I already feel like not going through with uni. Thoughts about failing and having to drop out have been occupying my mind for days now. My Bio I professor opened up the course early for people to preview, and I check the syllabus for labs and I see that having lab partners is going to be a requirement. I know that eventually I'll have to work with other people but it worries me that I'll have partners that don't put in their work or don't want to cooperate. Math is also not something I am particularly strong at and have had long lasting issues with, but I have been trying to prep for College Algebra over the summer by myself. I feel like I won't be able to juggle these courses all at once, despite having a greater course load during a previous semester.

164wv61,Did CPR for the first time today,"There was a really hectic code on my unit, so the residents and I were the first ones in there. We called the code and started ACLS. I was the next person in line to do CPR and by that time there were like 20 people in the room. RT intubated during the pulse check and I was up next. My heart was pounding so hard I was trying to take deep breaths and remember ""the first step in a code blue is to take your own pulse"". I was up and focused on doing the best compressions I could. We got ROSC and the patient went to ICU, and afterwards I got hit with a wave of emotions. I've seen codes from the door before but never actually done CPR. After it ended I was absolutely surging with adrenaline and was super overwhelmed. I managed to say to the resident ""that was my first time doing CPR"" and broke down in tears. She was incredibly comforting and I'm so grateful she was there. But man, I didn't expect this to get to me so much. I wasn't even upset about anything specific. It went well, but i couldn't stop sobbing for like 5 minutes afterwards, and I kept picturing the patient's face while I was doing compressions. I feel so exhausted, and it was so hard to finish the day after that. I'm pretty nervous for my next one - I know it's okay to cry, but it's still embarrassing and tough to do at work. To anyone who has had a hard time with codes or other emotionally difficult parts of the job - you're not alone.

Particularly, you go over the syllabus and class expectations during the first week, and you already have students telling you how they're completely overwhelmed and stressed about the class being too hard.

I'd love to tell my students how many times I felt overwhelmed and experienced imposter syndrome as an undergrad a long time ago, but I did what I had to do and graduated (not without some small breakdowns along the way). But I would have never told my professors this! This is why I remind my students about psychological services on campus and they shouldn't be embarrassed to use them.

1n2k3r9,Extending Gap Year by 6 Months? Feeling Guilty and Anxious...,"I dealt with a lot growing up (abuse, addicted parents, paternal suicide, ptsd, divorce of parents, etc.). My mental health was poor in younger years, and it took awhile to become stable. I married at 18, worked, divorced at 27. As a result, I ended up going to college much later in life than most others.

At age 34, I graduated magna cum laude with BSc degrees in physics and economics. I had gotten to perform research at one of the most prestigious institutes, I sat in on private lectures given by Nobel laureates, got into Phi Beta Kappa and ended up with a really great senior capstone advisor. 

My capstone advisor was so supportive of me and kind that I decided to do an MS with him as my thesis advisor. He also offered to be my PhD thesis advisor if I want to do a PhD. 

There was initially a 6-month gap between the end of my BS programs and the beginning of the MS, but I had to defer the MS offer due to medical reasons (I needed a major surgery). So I ended up inadvertently taking a ""gap year."" The plan was then to start in Spring 2026. I later realized that I also needed the extra down time; I was frankly burnt out and had fallen into a deep depression. 

Unfortunately, a lot of the gap year turned out to be quite stressful. My stepdad - who is so close to me that I call him ""dad"" - developed a potentially fatal neurological condition. I researched doctors, drove him to appointments and spent a lot of time on the PubMed database. As that was going on, I lost a romantic partner of two years I was deeply in love with, who had also been a long-time close friend (she lied to me about her having an intimate relationship with someone else). After that, I ended up in the ER from a cardiac event. I am still working with cardiologists to get several different tests done to figure out what's wrong with my heart. I am also potentially in need of another surgery but will first know that early next month after a consultation. This one would be elective, but I've been wanting it for years.

In light of all of that, I feel like I never got the rest and recovery I'd hoped to have during my time off. Now, I am considering extending my gap year by another 6 months, so that I'd start my MS program in Fall 2026 (instead of Spring 2026).

I feel guilty and anxious about taking those additional 6 months. I'm older and am ashamed of my age. It feels wrong to be even older when I start. Plus, I feel indebted to my mentor. He was really good to me, had funding set aside for me for Spring 2026, and I am still doing research with him this entire time. I feel bad that I would once again be delaying my graduate studies. But I feel exhausted and somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of stuff to deal with in life at the moment. 

It also worries me that I need to fundamentally reapply to the program. I can't use a medical deferral twice. So regardless of whether I started my MS in Spring 2026 or Fall 2026, I would need to re-apply. I spoke with my mentor about the situation and he assured me it is extremely unlikely they'd decline my application. The department wants me but because they're planning on setting aside funding for Spring 2026, they have asked me to let them know when I want to start by October 2025 already. My mentor's advice was for me not to worry about this and to apply for whichever time causes me the least amount of stress. 

So I am staying in my student apartment and considering first re-applying for Fall 2026. Having to inform the department of my decision by October (due to their funding plans) adds to the pressure I'm feeling. Even though I have the support of my mentor and his assurances, the idea of extending my break by 6 months causes causes me discomfort. But so does the idea of starting without having fully rested and doing everything I've been wanting to do (like the 2nd surgery)

Is this normal? Am I worrying too much? Does anyone have any advice as to how I should best view this situation? 

I am struggling with feelings of guilt for wanting a bit more downtime. Because life was so hard, I always had to overachieve to have a hope of escaping the hole I was in. But right now, I feel like I'm running on empty.

Thanks for any tips, advice or ideas you might have. I'm the first in my family to get a degree, so I'm generally bad at understanding how the gradschool landscape can be navigated in situations like this (and actually in general).",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n2k3r9/extending_gap_year_by_6_months_feeling_guilty_and/

Hey, I'm researching why grad students procrastinate on thesis writing because I want to help specifically with this problem. Not for a class - I genuinely think we need better solutions than ""try harder.""

Key findings from 38 respondents:

* 82% feel ""overwhelmed"" when attempting to write (don't know where to start)
* 100% of students aged 22-25 report severe/significant life impact vs. 41% of those 26-30
* Current productivity solutions systematically fail: Pomodoro breaks when interrupted, time blocking fails with real-world chaos, and accountability creates shame
* 76% procrastinate ""often"" or ""very often"" despite knowing the consequences
* This isn't time management failure - it's emotional regulation dysfunction (anxiety, perfectionism, self-doubt dominate)

The pattern is clear: we're treating productivity symptoms while ignoring emotional causes.

13wbenb,Have You Taken Away Anything Valuable From SP Encounters?- Coming from an SP,"Bit of background- I'm basically working full time as an SP in Australia. I'm not sure what It's like everywhere, but at least at the Uni I work at, SPs only give 'feedback' on communication during debriefs. We have zero say on how students are marked for competencies, and especially OSCEs.  

I put in a lot of emotional work when the time calls for it, whether it's playing a young woman having a loss of pregnancy or a grieving relative or whatever. I do this because a) I need to exercise my skills between acting projects somehow, and b) I genuinely care about the student's learning and I want to give them a glimpse into the real world so that they aren't as overwhelmed when they encounter the same scenario in real life. That being said, I'm aware that it is a very artificial environment so when it comes to osces and exams, idgaf about my acting cause I know you're under a time crunch, I basically Eminem rap out my answers and pray each student can get through all their tasks.  

I can say this job is starting to take a toll on me mentally now, dealing with 10 plus hours of students palpating, prodding, squeezing, and manoeuvring me in a freezing room with just my sports bra and bike shorts on, or being tasked with having to pretend that my child's life is in immediate danger while some students giggle or roll their eyes at me (not all though, some students have really big hearts or show respect even if they aren't suspending their disbelief as much), leaves me feeling like a glorified guinea pig.  

I've been keeping my chin up by telling myself that I'm at least helping the community a little bit (by helping the people that will directly help the community). However, I've felt really saddened after I came across this subreddit. I found out SP's are seen as nothing more than a waste of time with huge egos and shit advice on empathy. Now if that is your experience in medical school you are completely valid in your frustration, and I'm truly sorry you have to deal with that stress on top of everything else that is expected of you. I guess what I'm asking for is any case where you actually got something valuable out of a sim class, because otherwise I don't want to keep wasting your time and my time by trying to give feedback when the lecturer or junior doctors could spend it.

1h5pwrr,"Passed My Viva with Minor Corrections, but I Feel Like a Fraud","Hi everyone,

I just had my Viva last week and technically passed with minor corrections. You’d think I’d be over the moon, but honestly, I feel completely torn to shreds. Instead of relief, I’m overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy, like I’ve been handed this PhD for the sake of everyone else’s convenience rather than my own merit.

**A Bit of Background:**

My PhD journey has been rough. Like many, COVID threw a wrench into my plans, but on top of that, I’ve dealt with significant mental health struggles and caring for sick parents. My project started out as computational genetics-focused, but due to various obstacles (including my own struggles), it evolved into a broader, more basic epidemiological study. On paper, it had breadth—lots of different analyses—but from my perspective, it lacked depth and originality.

My supervisor insisted I had more than enough for a PhD, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was just being kind, given everything I was going through. Deep down, I hated my project and felt ashamed of my work, spending my entire PhD battling the feeling of not being good enough.

During my PhD I went from being someone who was curious, hard-working and somewhat smart, to being extremely disorganised (missing deadlines), lacked any motivation to learn and seemed to have unlearned everything I knew.

**The Viva:**

One examiner was gentle, while the other was...direct. They seemed frustrated with me/the work. They pushed for more XYZ analysis. I blanked on some questions that I really should have known the answer to, which made me feel even worse. There were moments where it felt like they missed parts of my work or contradicted what journal reviewers had told me to remove (my work isn’t published yet btw, it’s under review). I’m not someone who is defensive or precious about my work, so if I’m given criticism I’ll normally agree with it. There were a couple of moments where I felt like I wanted to cry. 

At the end of it, I walked out feeling stupid, expecting major corrections or even a revise-and-resubmit verdict. The only reason I got minor corrections was because Examiner 1 convinced Examiner 2 to ease up. I can see their points, and in a way, I agree with their critiques. But instead of feeling relief, I feel like I don’t deserve the PhD and certainly not my post-doc position.

**Where I’m At Now:**

I was offered a post-doc (in the same department) before my Viva, but I feel like quitting. I don’t believe I have the skills for data analysis, bioinformatics, in any type of academia/industry job. I’m exhausted, mentally drained, and lacking any resilience. All I want to do is hide away and cry. I'm finding it so hard to face everyone congratulating me.

I know this sounds dramatic since it’s ""just minor corrections,"" but I genuinely believe my PhD was handed to me for others' sake—my supervisor’s reputation, departmental harmony, collaborations etc.

I mostly needed to vent, but has anyone felt similar? Has anyone pivoted completely from their PhD? Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. 

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you to all. Whilst my self-esteem is probably shattered (obvs my own issues in there combined with academic life), I'm trying to finish up and move on. Hoping my next job helps rebuild my confidence in my skills.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1h5pwrr/passed_my_viva_with_minor_corrections_but_i_feel/
1g9tdto,Thought I was dealing with a tick bite infection that messed up my whole month… test result today came back negative and now I feel awkward and behind ,"So about a month ago, I woke up to a small brown insect on the back of my right leg in bed in my new apartment. We also had a mouse problem in the apartment at that time for what it’s worth. 

A couple days later, I began to have increasing rashes and itchiness all over my body, new spots popping up each day. It started with behind both knees before spreading to my legs, torso, armpits, arms, etc as the days progressed 

I also began to have random shivering and chills at night until I was unable to sleep several nights on end, despite trying hard to 

I also started noticing cognitive decline, memory issues, focus issues, and a need to turn everything in at absolute last second… otherwise overwhelming anxiety and brain fog

I also began to have increasing nerve/joint inflammation and stiffness  - neck, back, pelvis.. one day even my ankle was randomly on fire 

I chalked all these things up to stress and didn’t take it seriously 

Then all of a sudden last week, the symptoms hit me like a freight train. I was unable to sleep AT ALL 2 nights in a row, was shivering constantly, and could not think straight

Then, last Wednesday, it became very very hard to even sit. So much physical pain. Heart palpitations. Shortened/strained breath. Could not stretch my stomach without pain. Kept being hunched over. Kept falling asleep. Dozing off. All muscles and joints on fire. Began to cry from all the pain 

Emailed all my professors that I was going to urgent care, went to urgent care, bawled my tears out in pain, got antibiotics… have felt 80% reduction in all symptoms ever since, these last 5 days 

While waiting on the blood test results from urgent care, I went to the university health center yesterday to discuss the situation 

The nurses are the university health center said based on my full description of symptoms, timeline, and my positive reaction to the antibiotics, my suspicion of the tick bite made total sense 

However, today the test result came back from urgent care… negative 

This is so confusing to me. I am seeing that apparently, Lyme antibodies are not produced until 4-6 weeks after infection, so false negatives are actually common if individuals get tested **too early**,…

But at the end of the day, the test result was declared “negative” and now I am totally stuck on how to communicate with my professors 

I have rapidly fallen behind deadlines in ALL classes + my research + my impressions with my PI and professor due to my total sloppiness and lethargy and lack of communication this entire month 

Last month, everything was okay and I was actually ahead of the game in so many ways

Now… I feel so behind, so awkward, and a degree of shame as if I lied and made all this up

Yet… I was 100% in intense pain, with various symptoms, this whole month now 

I just can no longer provide a concrete confirmation I guess, and that’s making me really overwhelmed right now emotionally, especially since I am in such a small cohort 

My professors have emailed me saying I need to submit my pending assignments 

I do not want to identity with a Lyme diagnosis and use it for pity or a get out of jail free card… but I truly believe I was clearly struggling with *something* physical, that the antibiotics have *clearly* helped these last 5 days 

I’ve never been in a such situation where a health matter affected my whole day to day… but now I also feel delusional reading a lot of the online conversation about Lyme 

This was all brand new to me 

A couple of my professors have been sympathetic and told me to take my time but I still just feel so awkward right now, In multiple ways… as if I am awaking from a 1 month haze 

I truly believe I was dealing with a legitimate infection but now I’m stuck as to what to communicate and how to get back on track 

I do NOT want to make excuses. I do want to revive my momentum and excel. But I feel that this has soured my impression with PI/professors and momentum a lot  .. especially because now I can’t “prove” my suspicions of what I was dealing with 

And furthermore, if I indeed do have Lyme or some other tick/bug bite illness, that just wasn’t represented on this blood test, that’s still a stressful thing to think about as well right now on top of all my pending assignments and tasks ",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g9tdto/thought_i_was_dealing_with_a_tick_bite_infection/

I never really knew what I wanted to do to begin with, but now I’m second guessing every decision I’ve made so far. I have limited choices as this is a small university, but I want to stay in the Business field because I don’t want to go back through college again, and I know Business degrees offer a broad opening to the workforce, which is a major reason I picked it to begin with. 

I was interested in Human Resources, but now that I know what it’s all about, I don’t know if I would be able to handle that everyday. I am pretty introverted, don’t like confrontation, get stressed out and overwhelmed EXTREMELY easily, but I really like the idea of learning about working with people and the psychology behind management.

I hate Accounting and Data Analytics and all that stuff, but I genuinely don’t know what to do with myself right now. I feel like I’m picking the wrong major, I just want a job that allows work-life balance, and where I’m not bombarded 24/7.

Do I need to just give up on the whole business thing and start all over and pick something else (idk what), or just stick it out and stay in Management, or pick something else like Marketing or General Business. HELP!

1m88pj6,An Email Template for Reaching Out to Your Supervisor When You're in a Bad Way - mental/physical/emotional health,"Hey all, 

STEM major here. A couple of months ago, my mental health took a real dip. I was in the midst of carrying out a bunch of lab work while also preparing for several big presentations. I got through the presentations and absolutely crashed - my mental health was so poor I felt like dropping out was inevitable. Before I made any big decisions, I reached out for help and took some time away, which allowed me to get back on track. 

Whilst I was agonizing over my decision, I searched high and low for an email template to guide me through reaching out to my supervisor. I couldn't find anything online (and I despise AI), so I made do. Writing that email took a lot out of me at the time, so I thought I would post it just in case anyone else is ever in my position and just needs the words.

Obviously, grain of salt, adjust as needed, use your judgment, be nice, etc., etc.



Hi \[*PI*\],

I want to give you an honest update in regards to my well-being.

I have been feeling very overwhelmed lately, and my current \[*mental health/life stuff*\] is starting to impact my overall health. \[*Place to describe some details - I talked about how my physical health was negatively affected, and there was a noticeable effect on my energy, motivation, and focus. Keep it short and sweet, details are unnecessary.*\]

While I initially thought I could manage my current priorities, \[*something about how you feel like it's going to spill over, and how you'd hate for the situation to impact them as well*\]. I hope that by being honest with you we can set some realistic expectations and maintain momentum with my work. To start, here is a list of my current priorities:

* Abstract A (300 word) due \[date\]
* Abstracts B and C (500 word, 1300 word) due \[date\]
* Comprehensive written summary of work to-date (from committee meeting feedback)
* \[experiment D\]
* \[experiment E\] 
* \[ordering\]
* \[organizing\] 

The \[*D & E* *from list*\] work listed above is the biggest cause of concern for me at this time. \[*I'm feeling...*\]. I am taking steps \[*to sort said shit*\], and I have \[*external supports who will be helping me through this time*\].

With your permission, I would like to put a pause on \[*parts of list from above\]* to focus on \[*A-C*\]. Once I have \[*completed biggest priority*,\] I will \[*do other listed tasks*\]. We can then plan for me to \[*pick up the things that I said I couldn't do above*\].

This will also give me a chance to get acquainted with \[*some new tools/people/opportunities*\] that will help with \[*coping strategies - time management, getting into a better environment*\].

I know this is a lot of information to take in and that you already have a lot on your plate, so please don't feel like you have to respond quickly. I would gladly answer any questions or discuss this further in person or over email.

179uvcc,"Should I explain why I've missed a month's worth of class to my professor, or just take the L and drop the class while I still can","I'm embarrassed even posting this, but I've been absent from my geology class for about a month. My professor is extremely kind and understanding.  From what I understand, nothing in the syllabus implies that he doesn't accept late work. In fact, I remember being in class and him saying ""just turn it in when you can"" in reference to an assignment.

The reason I've been absent for so long is humiliating. I've been dealing with some pretty bad mental health issues and was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago. I'm also already diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I've been having constant nightmares, flashbacks, and days without sleep due to intense anxiety and guilt. It started off with missing ""just a few days of class"" to allow myself to recover, but then I became too afraid to show my face again. I am about to start therapy for the first time soon though and I've been taking a prescription to help anxiety and sleep.

The reason I'm so embarrassed is that basically everyone deals with mental health issues. I understand that struggling is valid, but it's not a decent excuse to miss class for a month and expect the professor to let you submit tons of late work. My question is: should I explain my reasoning for missing class to my professor with medical proof? And ask if there's still a possibility of me passing the class if I complete all my late work and consistently attend class from now on? If yes, should I do this over email or in person? Or, should I just take the L and withdraw from the class with a W on my transcript and no refund. The last day to drop the class with a W is October 20th, so 3 days from now.

111hlut,Don't know what to do about the lack of college preparedness at this point,"I teach at a small regional comprehensive university that serves a lot of first generation college students, so I'm used to teaching a lot of kids who don't really know how to be a college student, but this semester is feeling particularly dire. I teach a 100-level history class with 22 students, and I just had to fill out an early academic alert for ten of them, because they haven't submitted any assignments yet. Those who are making an effort to keep up with the work are expressing pretty massive anxiety and a sense of being overwhelmed by pretty basic tasks. And once they do submit assignments, they're often riddled with grammatical errors, misspellings, and malapropisms that would be subpar at the high school level.

And their reading comprehension is just as bad. I assigned an article about the Guadalcanal campaign. The title of the reading was ""Guadalcanal"". It was written by a former student of mine for a general audience, so not some dense academic article. The first sentence starts out by talking about Pearl Harbor and quickly goes through the history of the US's entrance into WWII before focusing on Guadalcanal. And I had several students write in their responses that this was an article about the attack on Pearl Harbor. And these responses would cite other details in the article that leads me to believe they actually *did* read the whole thing--I don't think they read the first sentence and BSed their response based on that. I genuinely suspect they lacked the common sense to identify the main topic of the article. I suspect they hadn't heard of Guadalcanal before but had heard of Pearl Harbor, so they glommed onto what was familiar and read the whole article through the lens of what they already knew.

I feel like I'm coming up against this lack of basic reading, writing, and organizational skills again and again, and I don't think it's the students' fault. I just don't know what the heck these kids are being taught in high school anymore. Plus my university has been so concerned about its enrollment numbers--since even before Covid--that it's really starting to feel like students are being admitted who just aren't ready. They would almost certainly be better served in community college, but I think our admin views community college as the competition. But I genuinely don't know how to help a classroom of students when such a large percentage of them are entering the classroom with this low a baseline.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/111hlut/dont_know_what_to_do_about_the_lack_of_college/

1la67wi,MS3 considering IM vs Psych,"Hey everyone. Seeking advice!

I’m an MS2 about to transition into MS3. My school starts rotations a bit early, so I’ve already had a couple IM blocks and a couple weeks of outpatient psych and a couple weeks of psych emergency care. Right now, I’m just considering IM and Psych. I’m someone who values work-life balance a lot. I was initially considering anesthesia, but honestly, I don’t think I’m built for it. I’d really like a stable, predictable day to day life and my advisor at school told me to think about Psych. I like the pharm, I like that you can make a huge difference in patients lives, and patients often feel better with your treatment, but I’m not sure I totally feel “passionate” about mental health like some of my psych-interested peers do. I kinda like the pathology, I’ve realized I don’t get bothered hearing about tough situations but I do prefer short, focused patient interactions. I worry that I may not “care enough” to do psych, but I also wonder that if my ability to look at tough situations objectively and not feel overwhelmed might be a good thing. I like that psych is a short(er) residency, the hours are decent, and as an attending you can work virtually a lot. The field is booming and job security is a huge pro. However, I don’t know if I truly mesh with the patient population or with the provider population for that matter. What are some signs that psych may be right for me?

Ultimately, I want medicine to be one part of my life, not the whole thing.  I want freedom, flexibility, and a decent paycheck. Not sure if that leads me to IM or to Psych. Is it worth going into IM and just deciding later if I want to specialize? Appreciate any thoughts, stories, or advice from those who’ve been through it.

I'm overwhelmed sometimes by the pressure of being a CS major and especially right now as I'm a senior student trying to find a job during a recession. I did 350 LC problems in a month, mostly medium and hard starting from 0 (That's like easily over 10 hours of programming per day). I go to a top 15 University with decent GPA and applied to around 100 companies only to receive less than 10 OA's. Thanks to the practice I had on LC I Aced all of the OA's but only 2 of them moved on to an interview. I don't know how much my international status as a Canadian or my identity as an Asian male factors into this.

I'm just kind of sad at this point. I know I wouldn't be broke even if I don't find a job as my family is fairly rich, making a couple of millions per year. At the same time I feel like my life that culminated to this point is pointless. This include doing well in school from primary school to get into a good secondary school, then to a good University, and lastly potentially landing a high paying job. Don't get me wrong: I like Computer Science, but I certainly don't like the above average pressure and work load that's associated with it. I guess this is only exacerbated by the fact that my parents have high expectations for me as I'm always that ""good kid"" growing up.

1mocysr,Need a Pep Talk,"Hi friends. I am new to this group! 

I need a major pep talk... I am a rising second year in a PHD program for neuropharm and I am hitting my semi-annual ""Am I making a hug mistake"" depression. 

For context: I am a first-gen American who worked her butt off in high school for a 4.0 unweighted and 4.8 weighted GPA, was class president, and Valedictorian. I became a first-gen Student when I got the opportunity to attend an elite school on scholarships and graduated with and degree in Biology! Now here's the thing... College and being away from my family took a huge toll on my mental health... My overachievement did not follow through my undergrad. Although I was in a couple clubs and graduated with a 3.6 GPA, I wasn't super sure about my options after college. As a first-gen my immediate go-to was to be a medical Dr but I ended up preferring research instead which is why I applied to PhD programs. I got an interview for an Ivy and one for my Texas local university but only got accepted into the latter. So... Not knowing what else to do... I accepted and I've been here for a year.


Truth be told, I wanted to quit within the first 3 months but I told myself I'd make it at least a year before I made a decision - especially because I am not good at change at all. I moved back in with my parents, bought a car, and actually finished with great grades but little project-progress. Now I'm a year in wondering if it's time to call it quits. 

Don't get me wrong... I love research... I just hate feeling like I'm making a mistake. I hate thinking I could've done so much better in a more math-based field (which I absolutely excelled at: A+ in math and physics always through college) vs neuropharm which has always interested me but is a topic in which I lack knowledge. I thought grad school would be more classwork where I could learn how to become an expert but I just feel like cheap labor. I feel stupid all the time, I lack structure in my studies, and I feel overwhelmed 24/7. I also hate that I can't move out because I cannot afford an appartment, groceries, car payments, and insurance payments on this student salary (I'm sure many can but this is my personal experience). My classmates all do this with seeming ease but I recently learned that their parents take care of a lot of their bills (which my parents do not ... I pay rent to them). I hate that my friends all have weekends off and can shut-off their work brains and take vacations and literally LIVE when I am constantly feeling like a damn failure. I also hate that I'm the oldest anyone in my family has ever been without a husband or kids... And that my family plans revolve around my graduation prospects. 


Idk if this is just a rant, an attempt to seek words of encouragement, or if I'm just looking for someone to tell me it's ok to quit. I just really don't know what I'm doing in life and no matter what I choose, I think I'm going to hate myself for it. Like how can I justify 4 more years of this when I could be living a normal life and helping my family with bills? How do I convince myself that this is the right path for me? How can I quit when my PI is traumatized from having many people quit before me?

Sometimes I have very short bursts when I think I maybe have it figured out and I am on the right track but then reality quickly shows up at the door in the form of my supervisor being disappointed with me.

We have this project where I have to manually transcribe data from 150+ locations. There is no way to make it automatic, the data are just too chaotic and sparse. The way it works is that we filter out the locations where the results from the data analysis are above a certain threshold. So the data transcription and analysis is crucial for everything that comes afterwards. My supervisor had asked for an extra hand because it's a lot of work and so I volunteered - it was very relevant to my own research anyway. But I wish I never did.

Essentially I lost track of the data analysis at some point and made a mess. Twice. I was lucky that the mess didn't end up affecting anyone's work, in the sense that it could be fixed easily without compromising the entirety of the paper (which will be submitted in two weeks and is a team effort). But my supervisor was very clearly angry and impatient at me for being so sloppy AGAIN. He is the kind of person that never gets impatient with anyone so that was really hard to witness.

And then there are other things. I am leading a scoping review with 8k studies. After screening them all on Covidence, I realized that the papers that had passed the screening were not what I was expecting whilst the ones that I meant to talk about didn't show up at all and my search terms were pointless. So essentially the whole review was worthless. I had to reshuffle and reorganise the terms completely and my supervisor had to send an email to Covidence asking them to reset our review so that we could start from scratch as we only have one paid license. Our initial goal was to publish in early May.

On top of that I have to take classes, which I imagine is normal for a pre doc, and I wonder how people manage because I most certainly do not.

I am writing a paper and the review and the project are tangentially related but I have neither the time nor the energy to properly research references and put things together coherently. Whenever I submit written material to my supervisor he basically re writes 90% of it.

I haven't published anything yet. I have been here since September and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. 

Doesn't help that my supervisor is from another continent and I often feel we just communicate on two fundamentally different levels. I feel I am constantly failing him. I am grateful to be here and I am grateful that he's my supervisor but I don't think he knows. I think he believes I'm shit.

I am sure lots of conversations about me and my performance are happening behind closed doors. I am ""that student"". I have already noticed subtle hints. Like the way my boss increased the frequency of our meetings and at the same time how he reduced the number and difficulty of my tasks, the way he went from being relatively friendly to somewhat annoyed etc. And oh my God do I feel embarrassed about it. I am so self conscious and aware of it and yet I can't seem to change.

I tried to be a good student and colleague, humble, proactive, diligent, but it always ends up with me getting overwhelmed and making a mess.

1n5cft8,questions from a cooked sophomore,"I’m a 2nd year undergrad student and i go to a community college and really just don’t know anything regarding career stuff, like everyone around me has been getting internships since high school and doing programs i’ve never even heard of. So anyways, I’m trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.

Firstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I’ve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people’s resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that’s a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that’s something worth sharing or if maybe I’m just not ready yet to be applying to internships.

Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I’ve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they’re not very relevant to cs so I don’t wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it’s worth adding? Lmk guys.

Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help 🙁.

Ok thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1n5cft8/questions_from_a_cooked_sophomore/

i’ve never been so anxious in my life. im constantly having mental breakdowns. this is my last semester of actual classes and i’m really trying to persevere but it’s getting to be so much at once. 

i go to therapy and i’m on SSRIs but they don’t make me feel any different. i’ve switched medications several times and nothing seems to help. 

my family doesn’t understand what i’m going through since none of them graduated high school even. my friends are all so busy with their own stuff, i don’t want to bother them. the guy i’ve been dating for nine months just started his big boy job and is gone every weekend and i don’t get to see him as much because our schedules are so different. 

in all honesty, it is only the third week of school and i feel so defeated. i have an exam almost every week. i am so tired. i know i just have to buckle up and push through, but it’s getting harder every day. 

when does it get better?

1fzoqdx,I missed a recommendation letter deadline and I feel absolutely awful,"A student asked me for a letter of recommendation for Fulbright, and the deadline closed yesterday. I did write the letter but I was too late, as the system stopped accepting submissions at 5pm, and I tried to submit at 6pm.

For context, I have never missed a recommendation deadline before. I consider myself highly responsible and have a strong reputation as a supportive educator, and I do love my students. But I am also incredibly overwhelmed right now, where I am working 10-14 hour days. I did have the deadline on my radar, but it got buried underneath the crush of everything happening right now. I used to be proud of the fact that I operate at a zero inbox, in that I typically have been able to answer all emails within 48 hours of receiving them, and I am very efficient. But this last three months, I can’t keep up anymore, because the emails come in faster than I can respond.

I feel just so truly awful. I will do the right thing and tell the student and apologize. I have also already emailed Fulbright to ask if they can take my letter late, but I am doubtful because the website said “no exceptions.” I just feel so upset and angry (at my situation) and I dont know if there’s anything I can do to fix this situation. I know I saw a post saying someone got into Fulbright even though one of their recommenders didn’t come through, but I can’t shake this feeling like I’ve just ruined her future.

Any advice on how to think about this would be appreciated.

EDIT: It’s worth mentioning that the student in question also happens to work for me as an intern, and she’s been so good, and I frankly feel like telling her she doesn’t have to do any more work for me because I’ve messed up, but I know that doesn’t make sense. I’m just so messed up about this.

EDIT 2: I sent the student a full and honest email about my mistake, offering to support in other ways if she needs it. I also offered that she could take a break from working with me for a little if she needs distance. I don’t think there’s anything else I can do at this point, and maybe I just need to cry it out or something to be able to move forward with my day.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fzoqdx/i_missed_a_recommendation_letter_deadline_and_i/
1mfx2yu,Fully funded international student with zero research experience. Excited but terrified. Seeking advice.,"Hey everyone,

I'm an international student from the middle east, and I've just been accepted into a fully funded (tuition, stipend, insurance, etc.) direct Master's program at a T20 university in the US. My field is ECE, with a focus on AI. My ultimate goal is to get a PhD after finishing Master's.

My main source of anxiety is that **I have practically zero research experience.** In my home country's university system, the focus was entirely on coursework. The whole concept of academic research and writing papers is completely new to me.

I'm looking for general advice, but I'd especially love to hear from others who might have been in a similar situation.

Specifically:

1. How do you even begin to learn ""how to do research"" when you're starting from scratch?
2. What should I be focusing on in my first semester and first year to set myself up for success?
3. For those who also made a big cultural and academic transition, how did you manage the stress and build a support system?
4. What's one thing you wish you knew before you started your PhD journey?
5. Do you learn on the fly while conducting research, or study everything related to the field before starting?

Thank you all in advance for any guidance you can offer!

Do you think a 3.72 is close enough to 3.75? Should I still (spend the money to) apply there?

17l7aay,How much do we tolerate before our emotions interject? Losing my cool with a student,"EDIT: ***I am very new to teaching at the college level (5 semesters in.) I am still learning how to navigate these things and had never been in a situation like this before. I teach communication studies and this class is a group communication class. This group has done poorly on a previous project, and with another one coming up, I wanted to make sure they were feeling well equipped, that they understood the directions, and that they were all on board and contributing. I had checked in with all other groups in class as well. ****

am a female professor. Recently I was addressing concerns with a group in my class. I stated that my aim was to ensure that their group begins to work well together and succeed on an upcoming project. I made it clear that I was not talking with them to place blame on any individual person and emphasized that I was chatting with them so I could see if there was anything I could do to help. 

Rather quickly, I noticed one of my students getting defensive. I continued to emphasize my desire to see them succeed together while also acknowledging this students comments and perspectives, most of which seemed very out of pocket and unhelpful to the situation. They continued to have a defensive response to everything I was saying, even when a defense was not warranted. I tried to keep my composure, telling the student I was not there to argue with them or accuse anyone of anything - I was only trying to check in. 

As the conversation continued, the student’s group members were getting overwhelmed with him and his responses to me as well. They were saying things like, “that’s not what she means” “that’s not the point” “you are not listening.” I tried to keep those responses to a minimum, but before I knew it, the student was speaking very angrily and loudly to me, and the person next to them was literally pleading with their team mate to calm down - they did not.

After about 15/20 minutes of this, I started to get worked up myself. I had just finished teaching 2 classes back to back and at this point, had my next class waiting outside. I said, I am feeling very overwhelmed by your demeanor right now, that I was done with the discussion, and that and I had another class. I told the student I wanted them to leave my classroom. I had to ask them 8 times to leave - each time getting more frustrated, overwhelmed, and angry. 

I wish I had kept my cool a bit more. I lost my composure and I did yell back at this student. I know that I could have handled it in a more “professional” manner, but there was so much going on I was incredibly overwhelmed and did not know how what to do other than to assert myself - nothing else seemed to be working. I’m only human. I have emotions too, especially in heightened situations where I feel powerless.

This student spoke with my department chair about the incident, as did I when I finished with my last class. The chair made me feel that my response was completely inappropriate and uncalled for. They seemed to think I had overreacted quickly and did not take the necessary steps to try to deescalate the situation numerous times. It honestly felt terrible to not have support over the issue, and to have my character and capabilities questioned. 

As professors, how much are we expected to tolerate? How are we expected to remain calm and composed while an aggressive student is being emotionally volatile?

What do we do in these kinds of situations? What do we do when our department chais do not have put backs?

1n5xehy,First day med school and anxiety,"Hii,

I i just finished my first day in med school and i’m quite overwhelmed. I had to drop out of another program because I got depressed and burned out, and got to the point where I was having (passive!) suicidal thoughts. I just didn’t have any light left in me. 
I’m kind of reliving the same feelings but not as heavy as before. I think it’s my body recognising i’m in the same situation again as when i broke down (being in school, just starting with uni etc.). I’m scared that the same thing will happen again. Has anyone experienced the same or does anyone have some advice? I would really appreciate it

When i got accepted into med school i was depressed too. I didn’t feel any excitement. But i don’t think i would’ve liked not getting in either hahaha.

I really enjoyed the content i learned today, so it’s not that i don’t like medicine or anything. It’s just that my depression, anxiety and (apparently) fear of failure are getting in the way.

I don’t want to have to drop out again. I want to keep going. But it’s just that im sick, and i dont know how to get better. I contacted my study advisor but i have to wait 2 weeks to see them, so i thought maybe there are other people who went trough, or are going trough, the same thing. 

The first course is really chaotic and i don’t know what is expected of me. I don’t really get guided as well as i did in previous programs, and i feel really lost. It isn’t that i find the content difficult, but the way the course is structured; it’s all over the place. This doesn’t help with the stress and anxiety i was already feeling🥹

tl;dr:  If you need encouragement, know that you will be okay as long as you move forward!  


PhD and doctoral work can be tough.  Long hours, frustrations, limited interactions with faculty that are busy or may seem like they do not care... The task is not the easiest.  You may even think to yourself ""I should have just stayed at the Master's level"" or ""If I wanted more schooling I should have gotten a second Master's.""  I'm here to tell you it will be okay, as long as you move forward and follow the basics.  These are what have helped me in life and schooling, I hope that they help you.  If not, then I'm sorry this doesn't speak to your needs!

**Take it a paragraph at a time.**  Literally and figuratively.  When you have an assignment or portion of your dissertation you need to work on, just pace it out one paragraph at a time.  Sometimes getting a paragraph alone finished is enough to take a break and do a quick round of \[insert game you like to play on your phone\].  But also think of what you have to do as ""paragraphs"" in the short steps to success that lead towards the big success.  One step at a time, one portion at a time.  Find ways to make forward progress, even if it's only a little.  Remember that big doors are swung by small hinges.  You can do it when you piece it out!

**Reach out for help.**  This one is tough for me, I will admit.  I tend to think that I could/should be able to do things on my own because there is so much I am able to.  But doctoral work is not easy and there will be times that we as students need to reach out.  This also applies to those in your life.  Reach out when you feel lonely, frustrated, worried, or even when you feel elated that you were successful in a big milestone!  Have those in your life that you can connect with and let them know when you have struggles or successes.  Have someone you want to establish a better or deeper connection with?  Reach out!  Let them know you want to connect, again small steps like coffee or some quick texts can lead towards something more substantial.

**Find your recharge station.**  Self care is the key.  What can you do to give you back energy?  What is something you could mark on the calendar to look forward to a few times a month?  Maybe it's cards with the guys, lunch with the girls, a double feature movie night with your partner, or just you alone with a controller in your hand and a pile of pixelated enemies on the screen.  What about daily?  What is something that you could see yourself looking forward to at the end of the day to recharge?  Is it scrolling through memes?  Meme therapy is real!  Maybe it's one of the above?  One of the biggest factors in your recharge is encouraging yourself with positive talk, letting yourself know (even out loud!) that you will be okay as long as you keep taking those steps to move forward in your progress.  

I'm here to tell you that you can do this, you might feel overwhelmed and overburdened and that is okay!  Those feelings are okay!  But challenge those feelings with action by moving forward one step at a time, connecting with those close to you in your life, and getting your daily/weekly self care activated.

How could I write when my basics were so weak?

I have officially been awake for a straight 44 hours now, and I don’t feel like I’ll be sleeping anytime soon - I’m trying to hold off an anxiety attack at the moment, and I’m hoping at least getting something out through strangers on the the internet will help.

I have a new professor this semester that I’ve only actually spoken to a handful of times (she was on a different campus than me last year, and now everything is asynchronous online due to our clinical hour requirement going from 25 hours a week to 40). In all of my courses, there is 0 tolerance for late submission of work (which I feel like is probably pretty standard for graduate programs, not complaining about it). We had three fairy heavy assignments due this week (by midnight Sunday, two hours since I posted this), as well as my clinical assignment had a particularly heavy week, but I though I could get through everything Sat/Sun since I had nothing else. I was wrong, which I realized pretty quickly on Saturday that I had majorly underestimated the amount I had to get done, hence being up since Saturday morning until now. 

As you’ve probably guessed if you’ve stayed this long into my rant, I wasn’t able to get this assignment turned in until after midnight.

This assignment was the 1st part of our major project, which is worth 60% of our final grade. And I thought I could reassure myself that it was only the first part……except there are only two parts, and the one I missed is the one that is worth 60% of the grade for the project as a whole. Doing the math with the remaining assignments in the semester, even if I get a perfect score on every single assignment from here on out, I will not pass the class. 

For my program, getting below a C in a class not only requires you take it again, but you are placed on academic probation. Which a part of that is I cannot attend more than 20 hours a week at my Clinical Assignment as opposed to the required average of 40 (also my preceptor had been telling me I have a job offer waiting when I graduate/get certified if I want it, but this may ruin that…). I’m not actually sure if how long the probation lasts, which is part of why I am freaking out. If it lasts for the full semester, there is quite literally no time to make up any hours, and my graduation will be pushed a semester. I am dreading having to tell my family and friends that have been so supportive - my husband has been graciously providing for 99% of our living expenses while I have been in grad school and is asleep next to me with no idea that I may have blown up our plans for the next year. I am praying for some miracle that I misread the syllabus and there are more grade points available from something - literally anything. (It is a weighted score, so it’s impossible unless she has mercy on me……). 

I’ve worked so fucking hard, and I know I’m halfway to delirious right now, but I’m going to lose it. Up until now, I have been doing pretty good for myself as far as grades - only 2 B’s, otherwise all A’s. Felt fairly decent most of the time, and was usually always good about deadlines. This semester had been tough as far as schedule, and I had an outside job that I barely worked, but I quit Wednesday just because I wanted to make  sure I could go use everything I had on this last year. 

Getting through typing this is at least helping the exhaustion creep in I think, my chest doesn’t feel like it’s going to explode anymore at least. Wish me luck on actually getting any sleep, and on my upcoming email shamelessly begging my professor for any sign of hope. I hope the rest of you are having a better semester than I am, good luck out there.

EDIT/UPDATE 1: First of all, thank you SO MUCH to everyone who posted. Having been a lurker of Reddit in general (not necessarily always this sub), I was expecting a mix of advice and support as well as some tougher comments. But the fact that you were all overwhelmingly supportive made me cry multiple times. I’m sure this was a mix of also being exhausted and overwhelmed, but I really truly appreciated all of the optimism and care ❤️

I have a meeting with the professor in less than an hour, and I will post a longer/full update after that. I typed up an email right after my initial post, and scheduled it to send at a more reasonable time (I used chat GPT to edit it to make sure it made sense) - I then passed out for a little bit around 5am until 11. When I woke up, it didn’t take my husband long to realize something was stressing me out, and he comforted me while I told him everything while crying. He of course is in my corner, and is supportive no matter the outcome. 

I have also caught up on sleep the past two days, with a full nights rest last night in preparation for this meeting. 

As far as the email, there will be no extension offered for this assignment, the meeting today will be to discuss if there are any options for grade recovery in the future assignments. I’ll provide more details and clarifications from some of the comments after my meeting as to some of the ramifications and results of that. 

Thank you again for everyone’s comments, I will post an update after for anyone who is still following ❤️",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1fsrpl8/i_screwed_up/
1j642hq,International Students: How Did You Do it!,"Hi everyone!

I'm reaching out to this incredible community of international students who've successfully landed internships or placements in Computer Science. I'm currently a rising senior majoring in CS, and honestly, I'm feeling quite overwhelmed. I've completed around 50-60 LeetCode problems, but without any relevant work experience in the US, I'm still unsure what steps to take next.

I would genuinely appreciate hearing your stories:

* What was the single most impactful thing you did that helped you secure your CS placement?
* Did networking, referrals, personal projects, or specific skills make the biggest difference for you?
* If you had the chance to do it all over again, what's the one thing you'd change or improve in your application journey?

Any advice, big or small, would be greatly appreciated. I'm eager to learn from your experiences!

How do you go about memorizing anatomy? Does it get easier? There are just so many freaking words to know and i have a really hard time visualizing different organs spun around. Doesnt help that we need to learn the all latin words but all images on google label everything in English.

Whats the best study routine to get this down? Flashcards, youtube, reading books, exercises, etc? How do you not get overwhelmed at the sheer amount of information?

EDIT: I am not interested in ""fuck ur work life balance, you need to study for every waking moment"". Yes med school i tough, but i will not feel like absolute garbage and have no life for most of my youth. If you dont have actual healthy advice that includes a reasonable work time i dont want it.

1ky1dln,How to best prepare for IM sub-I?,"I will be starting my IM sub-I this August and I'm shitting bricks. I never really figured out how to be a competent third year during my IM rotation last year. Got overwhelmed when carrying more than two patients. I had a really hard time filtering out what is important vs not with regards to management. Could not write discharge summaries or admit people to save my life. Really struggled with patient presentations and coming up with plans. I know my institution gives Sub-Is a lot of responsibilities, so I want to be prepared. I am applying radiology but want to do well on my sub-I and not kill anyone during my intern year. Also, most of my time before my sub-I is radiology electives/aways. I have a sleep medicine elective and palliative/hospice care elective before which may help me ease back into the clinical environment a little bit. What do I do till august to put myself in a better position?

Knowledge usually isn't the problem for me. I did well on all of my exams and would get most pimp questions right. The application of the knowledge I have is just subpar and not sure what to do. I don't know if there are decent resources that teach what to order for certain workups or treatment plans?

Any help would be much appreciated!!

I can’t differentiate anything on the slides, the attendings are flying through cases in seconds, and I’m being handed trays of slides with little to no guidance. It’s starting to shake my confidence. I went from feeling excited and aligned with pathology to wondering if I’m in way over my head. Did any of you feel this way early on? Did things start to make more sense and feel more enjoyable as you became more competent?

1n0fa17,"As a Master of Arts student, I was deported and barred by CBP in Houston.","Here is ap news report on my deportation: https://apnews.com/article/chinese-students-trump-deportations-visas-1820a05254632a3d0fa52ab85f47fe31.


1. Initial Arrival in Houston: A Cloud of Suspicion

When my plane landed in Houston around 5 p.m. on August 15th, I assumed it would be a routine entry. The immigration officer first questioned me about my old F1 and new I-20 documents (which were both valid), then informed me that I needed to follow another officer to have my visa number changed. That's when I was led into the secondary inspection room, which belongs to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)

I naively guessed that this was a reasonable request, thinking that my F1 and I-20 numbers might not match and that Customs needed to verify and update my visa number. With that in mind, I spent the first three hours in the waiting room, filled with worry but not panic. My main concerns were where I'd stay for the night and if my landlord would have to wait up for me. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a nightmare.

2. Unwarranted Questioning and Device Searches

A high-ranking officer, whom I'll call D, suddenly appeared. He first escorted me to retrieve my checked baggage, then led me into a small room where he inexplicably searched all of my belongings. I watched helplessly as he went through my clothes, books, and personal items, one by one.

He then took me to his office, pulled out a blank sheet of paper, and began asking for and recording my personal information: whether my parents or I were members of the Communist Party, if I was a member of the Communist Youth League, how much the membership fees were, my educational background, who funded my master's program, whether I was a member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), and my some of Chinese social media accounts. He was relatively mild-mannered while asking these questions, but a clear alarm bell went off in my head: was he focusing on my relationship with the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party?

I was too naive to think much of it: My parents were indeed party members, but I was not. I was only a member of the Communist Youth League, which is incredibly common in China, as almost all students join in middle school. Furthermore, my master's program was funded by a full scholarship from the University of Houston and my parents, with no direct ties to the Chinese government. All this makes me think that I am not their target.

Afterward, D took all my electronic devices, including two laptops, two phones, and a tablet, demanding their passwords and telling me to wait outside while he inspected them. At this point, my suspicion peaked. Neither the immigration officer's initial questions nor D's subsequent interrogation had uncovered any suspicious behavior on my part. The purpose of CBP is to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S. and to facilitate legal trade and travel. I had not demonstrated any threat to national security, nor was I entering illegally. I felt D had no reason to search my devices and access my private information at this stage. But, of course, I had no way to stop him.

As he led me back to the waiting room, D ""admonished"" me: ""Don't talk to the Chinese people out there. They're all bad."" I, of course, ignored his advice.

By chatting with the other Chinese individuals in the waiting area, I learned that two of the students present had already been deported and banned from re-entering the country for five years. They were a new Ph.D. student in applied physics and another in electrical and information engineering. They told me that D was the officer who had deported them, so my risk of deportation was very high. However, they believed that since my major is a non-sensitive field in the current U.S. political climate, I wouldn't face the same fate.

3. A Sudden Change in Attitude and Escalating Accusations

By this time, it was around 11 p.m. local time. I had been traveling for 29 hours and was utterly exhausted, but the anxiety kept me from sleeping. About an hour or two later, D called me back to his office. This time, he was a completely different person, full of aggression. As soon as I entered, he slammed the door shut, glared at me, and demanded, ""Why did you lie to me? Do you know that lying to a federal officer is a felony, and you could go to jail for it!""

As I stood there confused, he followed up with, ""Why did you say you never joined the CSSA?"" I was even more bewildered, as I had never paid attention to such a student organization before. He then picked up my phone, opened WeChat, and pointed at our university's ""CSSA Chinese Student Freshmen Group,"" asking, ""Then what is this?"" It was only then that I realized this freshman group, which I had joined after receiving an email invitation, was one of his main points of suspicion. D continued, ""Don't you know that the CSSA is funded by the Chinese government and is responsible for stopping any speech in the U.S. that slanders the Chinese government?"" Actually, my first reaction was to laugh, and I wanted to tell him that the head of our CSSA freshman group was an American (though I didn't say it to protect her). Still, I naively thought this wouldn't be a reason for him to deport me.

His next line of questioning focused on the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC). He found multiple chat records with friends about CSC and demanded to know why I was discussing it, whether I wanted to apply for it, if I had applied for it, or if I had tried to help others apply. The truth was, I had never considered applying and had not applied for it. I came to the U.S. for a fully-funded master's in philosophy with the intention of pursuing a fully-funded philosophy Ph.D. in the U.S., which would require no support from the CSC. I tried to explain this to him, but he didn't seem to care. I can understand why this topic might be sensitive; given the current international climate, some are afraid that Chinese students funded by the Chinese government are ""stealing"" American knowledge and technology. But what ""Arts"" knowledge could I possibly steal to ""serve the motherland""? Further, could merely discussing a topic on an app truly jeopardize U.S. national security? Or was this just a convenient excuse to justify their prejudice and suspicion?

D's final point of inquiry was a moral report he found on my laptop from my undergraduate days. At the beginning of the document, I had written, ""I firmly support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and adhere to the guiding ideology centered around Xi Jinping..."" D had highlighted this paragraph and asked why I had written it. In China, such documents are commonplace; almost every student or employee has had to write them at some point. So, I explained that it was a school requirement and did not necessarily reflect my personal beliefs; in fact, I had even used GPT to generate it. But to all my explanations, he had only one response: ""Why should I believe what you're saying now, and not what you wrote on paper before?"" I felt utterly helpless. At that point, I understood that CBP didn't care about my explanations and that my deportation was all but certain.

After this round of questioning, D took me back to the waiting room and, once again, said, ""I told you not to talk to those Chinese people. Now this is what you get."" Once again, I remained silent.

4. Judgment and Confinement

About an hour or two later, D summoned me to the office for a third time. He began by reading what sounded like a section of federal law, then had me raise my right hand and swear to the camera on the ceiling that I would not lie and would answer truthfully. This time, he started an official transcription. The questions were the same as the previous two rounds, but he was now meticulously documenting my answers to create a formal record. Still, I didn't dare let my guard down, watching out for any potential trap questions.

Luckily, this was the final round of questioning. Unfortunately, about twenty minutes after it ended, I learned my fate: I would be deported and banned from re-entering the country for five years. Two officers used black pens to cross out my student visa and then had me sign on an electronic tablet to consent to their judgment.

Once I signed, a sense of relief washed over me. The constant questioning, the struggle between hope and despair—it was finally over. But my body couldn't stop trembling. It was around four or five in the morning, and I had been out of contact for nearly twelve hours. I couldn't calm down or sleep, so I spent the night with the other Chinese travelers, sharing our stories. I learned from them that once you get a deportation order, the toughest part begins: you still don't have your phone and can't contact family or friends. Although CBP claims they'll arrange the soonest possible flight back home, they refuse to provide flight information, and you're only called to board about 20 minutes before takeoff.

The environment we were in was awful: the lights were on 24/7, the room temperature was about 15-17 degrees Celsius, and we had to sleep on single sofas, cots, or plastic stools. They didn't provide blankets, only an aluminum foil sheet to prevent hypothermia, and the only food was instant meals meant for survival. In these conditions, we couldn't get enough food or sleep, we didn't know how long we'd have to wait, and we didn't know if deportation was the final outcome or if we'd be suddenly told we were being sent to prison instead. The officers in the waiting room were also hostile and refused to answer our questions. They were very wary of us gathering together and talking. I once tried to go talk to another Chinese person, but an officer immediately ordered me to return to my seat or I wouldn't be allowed to sleep on one of the five precious sofas.

5. Liberation

Daylight finally came. Around noon, I was taken to be body-searched, fingerprinted, and to have my DNA taken. I was also allowed a one-minute phone call. The others told me these were the final procedures before boarding, a sign that I would be going home soon. Sure enough, an airline staff member came in the afternoon to confirm my checked baggage. D also made a rare appearance in the waiting room, chatting with the officers at the front desk and looking at us as if we were his captured prey. But still, no one came to tell me it was time to board, even as evening approached. I had been detained for a full day by then, and my spirits were crushed. I couldn't imagine how I could possibly endure another night in that cold, brightly lit waiting room.

In the early hours of the morning, I was finally woken up from a light sleep and dizzily led onto the plane. It was around 5 a.m. After being detained for 36 hours, I had lost my freedom, my hope, and my dignity. I flew over the sunrise on the coast of the California mountains and fell into a deep sleep, uncertain of what my future would hold.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n0fa17/as_a_master_of_arts_student_i_was_deported_and/

They say you don’t know what you’re talking about for everything when they can’t figure out anything without chat gpt. They don’t read. They write nothing. EVERYTHING must be an email. You have to give them instruction for literally EVERYTHING. One frustration with their grade and it’s STRAIGHT to the dean. Is this what it is now? My GOD. College is optional?! Like you do not have to come! You miss every class for the slightest inconvenience. I have a headache, my roommate is hungover and no one else can take care of her but me. I wasn’t feeling it. I didn’t sleep well. It drives me insane.  Critical thinking is out the window and let’s not even talk about grades. Maybe have your mom grade you since you keep mentioning how good she thought your paper was. Why TF is your MOTHER emailing me?! I am not paid enough to work this hard and answer every tiny email. I am confused how half of them passed enough classes to get to my course. They are lazy. Uninspiring and needlessly impressed with their own work.

1legi4w,"I'm leaving tech. It's too risky and unstable, better to get out before it's too late","



Lately, I’ve been seriously thinking about leaving the industry. Software engineering has become way too oversaturated. The amount of work you have to put in just to land a job, keep it, and try to secure your future it’s not worth the risk.

I honestly can’t picture myself working in tech in my 50s not because I don’t like it, but because I doubt there will even be jobs left by then. Right now, junior engineers are competing with thousands of others for the same roles.

This job has turned into constant competition and grinding, with no private life. The salary isn’t even worth it anymore.

I use AI tools regularly, and I’ve seen firsthand how fast and accurate they are at solving problems. The rise in productivity just means faster grind, more pressure, and higher expectations.

I’m an average engineer, and I don’t think there’s space for average anymore at least not for those who want stability, work life balance, and the chance to just do their job without constantly learning new tools or fighting for a spot.

The environment has gotten brutal in such a short time. AI has only been around for a few years, but the progress is unreal.

I don’t see myself in a job where I have to constantly perform and compete. This isn’t a career for someone who wants peace, security, and balance.

The interview process is draining. People spend months preparing, grinding leetcode, and still get rejected.

It honestly makes me sad and frustrated. I spent 10 years in tech, and now I feel like I have to leave it not because I want to, but because it’s not what I imagined it would be. And I don’t have the strength to keep pushing through.

I feel like I’m back in school. I thought adult life and work would be different, but working in tech feels exactly like school just solving math problems every day. There’s no repetition, no downtime. My brain never gets to rest. I’m exhausted from constantly solving problems, searching for answers.

It’s not like being a hairdresser or chef, where you learn a skill and use it day after day. In tech, everything changes nonstop.

Honestly, tech feels like the biggest scam. I invested so much time grinding algorithms, building projects for guthub, only to end up with nothing. I truly believe tech jobs are a kind of Ponzi scheme. If you’re not a genius from MIT, it’s just not worth it. I’m just an average software engineer not terrible but there’s no place for average anymore.

It’s gotten so competitive that it’s destroying my mental health and any hope for balance.

Really tough times. Being intelligent, educated, and still not being able to get a job it’s so frustrating.
I was among the best students all my life high school, college. I think I did everything I was supposed to do to get a job, studied after hours, worked on personal projects, built my own apps, gained years of experience and still, I feel average withouth safe job. Competing with thousands of other engineers.

1f8t3hp,"Possibly the worst outcome of a PhD defense—and no, it's not about failing","I've been a long-time lurker here and have always come across ""delightful defense"" stories. For quite a long time, I  wanted to post mine as I neared my defense examination. It happened yesterday, and it was indeed everything I wished for. The examiner was rigorous yet seemed impressed with the dissertation.  The audience appreciated the presentation, and both my supervisors were equally happy (context later).

...and just like that, it was time for celebrations. Never had I ever received these many congratulations within such a short span of time. It was a dream, and I was living it. I woke up today with the sole aim of getting all the required paperwork done and getting the official degree before I leave for home to spend time with my family.

While I was breezing through my paperwork like a pro, clocking in 12k step-count within a couple of hours and risking the pathetic weather multiple times, shit was just about to get real.

I received a call from my co-supervisor, and my instinctive gut feeling always gets things right. They were probably going to shit on me (we have a history, and getting calls like that implies a difficult conversation)..and boy, did my gut get me this time.

My primary supervisor had forwarded them the final defense passing documents for signatures, knowing that I had finished most formalities from my end within a day. They happened to have a ""conversation,"" after which the aforementioned call was made.

My throat hurts with the lump still. Long story short, ""they"" supposedly (within a span of few hours) decided that I should instead publish the remaining chapters before they could sign off the final recommendation to the Dean.

Verbatim:  ""You have tried to game us by partially writing thesis chapters for the sole aim of finishing the degree on time. You should have instead parallelly written the papers, and allowing your defense was a mistake. So, now, 'we' decide that unless you submit the remaining couple of papers, 'we' won't approve your degree. You can't be allowed to escape away, and don't think of it as exploitation since you're the one who will benefit from this. You don't have sufficient papers which you deserve, and that's really bad.""

It's my work, I understand. No one in the world wants to get it published and recognized more than me, but they don't happen to get that I am dealing with a lot of priorities at the moment, including mental and physical issues, most of which they know but I am sure don't care to remember. I did promise them to finish them up once I get back home since I have exhausted my fellowship tenure and can't afford to stay in the campus residence. Also, I did have an easy gap of months before I went for my postdoc.

I'm not angry. It's just sad that all these years of working together had to culminate at this level of distrust. Frankly, it hurts, to work really hard with all my might to see this day.

All my plans of partying and treating my labmates now stay indefinitely canceled. I don't know if I'm in a good mental state right now and might do something really stupid. Supervisors have a lot of power to influence my job recommendations; I don't want to mess up my career.

To anyone reading this far, thanks.

Seems I'll just go into the darkness now.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1f8t3hp/possibly_the_worst_outcome_of_a_phd_defenseand_no/
1mzrdig,This OA culture is getting absolutely ridiculous,"I’m a CS undergrad, just finished my second year and heading into third. This past week alone I had over **10 hours worth of online assessments (OAs)** from different companies. Some take 45 minutes, others take 2+ hours. That’s basically an entire workday of unpaid, high stress labour, on top of studying for my actual final exams.

The deadlines are also a real pain. Some want it done in 3 days, others give 7, and once in a while you get 14. But no matter what, you are always juggling them on top of everything else. And these are not simple LeetCode easy questions. They are long, camera-on, quiet-room, no-break marathons. Some require C++. Some even ask you to code in the language the company uses (for example Ruby), which is barely used outside of a few specific companies. You can probably guess which ones. I do not know Ruby, so I literally have to become comfortable with the language *just* to take their OA. If I got the offer, I would happily, absolutely learn it. But doing that just to maybe not be auto-rejected is ridiculous.

It gets even funnier :)  
I submitted an OA Sunday night. By Monday early morning I already had a rejection email saying they had “completed their review.” Did they even read my code? Or is the whole thing just an auto-grader that dumps you if you miss a single test case?

This whole OA culture is exploitative. They are using our major's nature against us. Programming can be tested online in a way most fields cannot, so they take advantage of that. They push these assessments on us, filter us automatically, and waste our time for free. Many are already buried with exams and applications, and now we are expected to grind out OAs too. If you do not pass every single test case, congrats, you're about to get humbled.

I genuinely think people need to start refusing to take these so that companies actually value our time and send a *real human* to interview us. Being a CS major should not mean being exploited like this. Nobody really talks about how bad it has gotten, but I'm exhausted and frustrated.

I appreciate anyone who reads this. If you agree, give it some support so the right people actually notice.

(Notes: I'm not saying these OAs ""don't work"". Of course it's one good way to showcase your programming skills. I'm saying that it's often a big sacrifice and extra stress for many students who already have limited time. It's incredibly tiring)",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mzrdig/this_oa_culture_is_getting_absolutely_ridiculous/

psv02t,Confession: I said some really stupid stuff in the OR and survived.,"Hello I am an MS4 and I saw someone's post about getting laughed at in the OR, so I thought I would post this because it's hilarious to think back on and might make someone feel better. 

This is a story in 3 Acts. 

I'm not a surgery person. I am neither a 'stand still' person nor a 'be quiet' person, so the OR is, to put it lightly, my least favorite place in the entire fucking hospital. I'd rather work at the VA than do anything in surgery. I love clinic. I love rounding. I detest surgery, so you can imagine my M3 Surgery rotation going well. 

In fact, I knew so wholeheartedly that it was going to go poorly that I got to the OR before any of my residents/attendings so I could warn the OR staff that I am an idiot moron who knows fucking nothing. I honestly think that helped. 

ACT 1: 

My first time scrubbing in, I fuck up my gloves (hell yeah, strong start) and have to rescrub, regown, reglove, the works. So I shuffle in after we've already started. It's a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair, and my attending surgeon is damn good at his job. He's already got the camera in, looking around. I'm trying to not be noticed as I sneak up to my designated ""Stay Out Of The Way Spot,"" and importantly, I am much shorter than everyone else. The screen for the camera is positioned in a way that's killing my neck, so I take a break to rest my neck and immediately dissociate because I am mentally ill. 

""Gracie, what's this?"" my attending asks, pointing with the laparoscopic needle driver to a pulsating tube. I immediately forget all of the tubes in the human body. I know this is a hiatal hernia repair, so I say, 

""Eeeeeesssophagus?"" 

There's silence. 

""It's pulsating,"" he says, very encouraging. I have run out of tubes and brain cells at this point, unfortunately, so I just say, 

""Uhhhh..."" 

He sighs. ""It's the aorta."" 

""Oh. Yeah. You're right,"" is what I say for some dumb ass reason. We make painful eye contact. He just... looks away. The rest of the surgery is quiet. 

ACT 2: 

The same attending, Day 2 of my surgery rotation, tries a second time to have me identify an organ because he has not figured out that I am a dumbass. He gave me the benefit of the doubt; truly, he is the fool the whole time. 

Note: this is my attending for the next 4 weeks. He does not get to get rid of me. 

It's a very similar stage as before. I'm zoned out, the camera is pointed to what is so obviously the spleen that I cannot even understand how I fuck this up. I know what it is. He says, ""Gracie."" 

I look at him. 

""You got this one?"" He's such a kind man. 

I look at the screen. My anxiety-riddled, smooth ass, swiss cheese brain, thinks, 'Okay, can't fuck this one up after yesterday.' 

Immediately, the word ""spleen"" evaporates from my mind. My eyes widen. I am trying so desperately to remember the name of this fucking organ. I'm like a Dickensian street urchin begging my brain for loose bits of change and anatomy. I know it. I just need to buy time, I think. 

""Gracie?"" 

My mouth checks in to the wrong fucking hotel and says, ""The uhhhhh... lung. But like... in the abdomen."" 

There's a beat. 

""It's got a name,"" I say, as if that helps at all. 

It does not. 

My attending blinks 4 times at me before saying, ""The... Spleen."" I nod. Yes. Of course. 

He goes back to operating. It's fucking dead quiet. There isn't even any music on. He eventually sighs and asks, ""Did you see the new Star Wars movies? What do you think?"" 

""I'm not a huge fan of the new trilogy after they basically wrote out Fin. But like, don't take my word too seriously, because I unironically love the prequels,"" is what I say because... It's true. 

He laughs and says, ""Yeah. I'm a big fan of Darth Binks."" 

The next surgery, the patient has a ton of adhesions, so when we stick the camera in, I say, ""Sheesh. It's like the Hanging Gardens of Intestylon in here."" He laughs for a good minute straight, and we just talk about Star Wars, D&D, other dumb shit. He does not ask me another pimp question for 4 weeks. 

He gives me an 'A' evaluation that basically boils down to, ""Gracie is fun to work with and brings a good mood to the team. She talks kindly with patients, and her skills in clinic are great."" He added a personal note that did not get put in my MSPE that said, ""You really should know about surgeries before you scrub into them, though."" 

ACT 3

I have completed my 4 weeks with my first service, and I now move on to General Pediatric Surgery. These will be, potentially, the most frustrating 4 weeks of my life. But I don't know that yet. 

I have one other medical student on my team for the first week. We round at 6 AM sharp (except the fellow doesn't ever show up until 6:30 so we stand silently in the hallway of the children's hospital until he gets there), and the policy is that the medical students cover every patient. 

Except we can't examine the patients ourselves. We have to hunt down each fucking nurse on 5 different floors to get the overnight. 

On my first week, we had 20 patients on service. So we both had to find 10 different nurses every morning before 6 am, so I'm fucking exhausted already when I get to the OR. 

It's been a few days. I have yet to embarrass myself too much. We have a ~6 month old who had an inguinal hernia repair, and the mother wanted a circumcision as well for some reason. I don't remember why. I have honestly blocked most of this rotation out. 

The surgeon is not the one who customarily does circumcisions, and this baby is larger than the usual circumcision patient. He's struggling a bit and eventually says, ""Gracie, can you just... Pinch the tip of it with your fingers and pull it taut for me?"" 

So I do, and I hate every second of it. It takes, no exaggeration, six hundred years for this man to fucking circumcise this fucking baby. He's focusing so hard, and he asks for the music to be turned off. The only sounds are of this surgeon cursing under his breath as he stitches. The situation is growing more and more awkward. 

The scrub nurse starts just commenting on things to fill the silence. The surgeon asks for silence. Not thirty seconds later, this scrub nurse fucker looks at me and, happy as you please, says,

""Wow, Gracie! You're really good at that."" 

And I. 

I can only describe this as pure brainstem action. I can guarantee there was no cortical involvement. I thought it for the first time when I heard myself say it. 

""Well... I did go to college."" 

Somehow, it gets quieter for about two heartbeats before one of the anesthesiology residents starts laughing so hard that he crouches in the fucking corner. 

I can see through her mask that the scrub nurse's jaw has dropped. 

The surgeon looks at me. He straightens up.

""Sorry, what was that?"" He asks. I'm not sure if it's a rhetorical question. 

I say, shifty, ""Nothin'."" I avert my eyes. 

He sighs. ""Okay."" He is suspicious. 

We finish the surgery. I survive 3.5 more weeks. I get my evaluation back. It's an 'A,' and he definitely got me and the other brown-haired female medical student confused, because I was not scrubbed into the surgeries he talked about doing with me. 

Or maybe he just copy and pasted. Who knows. 

I still ended up with a 'B' in surgery because I only passed the board by 3 points. Whoops. Maybe I should have known about the surgeries before I scrubbed into them. 

-FIN-

Edit: okay so. I did not expect this to pop off the way that it did lmao. Appreciate all the kind words, appreciate the unkind words even more. Please roast me. I've got way more stupid comments, actions, and patient encounters than y'all even know, and apparently most of y'all want more. In the effort to not annoy the hell out of people who are actually looking for real information, I was thinking that maybe I could do a weekly/biweekly post and let y'all vote for the theme (dumb OR moments, weird ass things my patients have said to me, dumb shit I've said on rounds, etc.). Call it Smooth Brain Sundays or something idk. Idek if the mods would be okay with that, but if they are, yee haw I'm down.

vqkcyd,Exposing the Disney College Program,"*if y'all can be so kind to crosspost, we'll get more views on this*

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the 100% truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay 400 dollars. The 400 dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid 400 dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have 50-100 dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in 4x4 (4 bedrooms 4 bathrooms), 4x2 and 2x2 (2 beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an 18 year old girl got put into a 2x2 with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until 1. You arrive there on your check in date and 2. You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a 2x2, you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have 24/7 availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an 8 hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you 8 hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of 9 days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over 12 hours. One of my friends got scheduled 14 days in a row, with almost every day being a 12 hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a 15 hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type 1 diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to 17 hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week, 2 months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my 90 year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vqkcyd/exposing_the_disney_college_program/

1buyve8,A story of adderall addiction and sobriety in medical school,"I'll keep this brief, but I wanted to share my personal experience with adderall addiction for the past 2 years and (for the last 30 days) my sobriety from it. I don't think this is talked about enough in our field. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I borrowed adderall from a friend near the end of MS1 because I was studying for step 1 and knew a lot of students were using it to grind all day. I don't have ADHD. I had tried other drugs before and never felt an attachment - I was overconfident that this would be the same. It started with just 15 mg IR here and there, but my tolerance went up and so did my doses. I started buying it from someone instead. For the first year and a half, I would take 30-60 mg throughout the day, about 2-3 days a week. It really does feel like a cheat code. I thought I was absolutely killing it, at barely any expense (cue Arrested Development. I was sacrificing sleep, money and CV health). But the dangerous benefit was how excited it made me to socialize, to call people on the phone and chat for hours, to engage with my hobbies obsessively. It feels renewing in a way - again, like a cheat code. 

Sometime last fall things picked up, and moderation became harder as I found myself not wanting to skip a day knowing I would get just a shit load of stuff done. When the ""Adderall magic"" (see: euphoria while studying) started to fade, I noticed I spent too much energy debating between taking a tolerance break and just... taking more adderall. And if I took some time off, I noticed how hungry, fatigued, and irritable I was within a couple days of going without it. On top of that I was simply not sleeping enough. I was easy to set off. Ironically I realized I wasn't studying as much while on it - I'd crank out some to-do items and then waste time doing other bullshit that was more or less having no positive effect on my life. *I was performing no better academically while on adderall than I had been before it.*

By the beginning of this year I was averaging 4 hrs of sleep a night, felt like shit, was phoning it in on my rotation and failing to cut down, even though I kept trying to. I had an incident where I thought I was having a heart attack that scared me like I've never been scared before. I broke down last month and told my sister (someone I trust and am lucky to have). I told another close friend because I needed help being held accountable. I deleted my adderall contact, forced a strict sleeping and eating schedule, and went cold turkey. I think it took about 10 days for me to stop feeling so fucking exhausted and famished all the time. By 3 weeks I didn't miss it. After 4 weeks I wasn't thinking about it at all. I hope I can keep it up, but at this point I'm feeling really good about it, which is why I feel comfortable sharing. 

I feel like stimulant abuse is a very played-down and underestimated phenomenon in medical school. I go to a well-known institution and a ton of my friends and classmates use adderall either off-label or straight up from a friend or dealer. If I was forced to make an estimate, I'd say this includes between 10-30% of my class.

Of course, this probably doesn't come as a surprise to many of you and I'd guess it wouldn't surprise many outside of medicine too. We live in a competitive environment that emphasizes ambition and consistency. It takes hard work, *sustained* hard work, to make it. In theory with the right amount of sacrifice and work ethic it can be done healthily, but it's obviously easier said than done. I know that some people using Adderall for performance can do it long-term with moderation, but I learned that I'm just not one of them. So I'm back to raw dogging life and now I'm back to enjoying it. 

Disclaimer: I'm not here to take a stance on the ethics of off-label stimulants because I was obviously abusing them.

My biggest takeaway is how arrogant and naïve my attitude was. I never thought I could fall into addiction. Like I said, I have enjoyed other drugs (for me this includes psychedelics, weed and alcohol), but I just never latched onto them the way I evidently do for stimulants. Now that I'm out - I fear and respect dependency in a way I was unacquainted with before. 

I really hope this resonates with any of you who might be in a similar spot. Feel free to share any experiences without judgment. I'm happy to elaborate on my experiences if anyone asks

August 2024 edit: if anyone was curious since I've gotten some messages, I haven't relapsed and I did pass step 2 without adderall. Wanted to score higher but I'm pleased to say I did it without using again

**JUNE 2025 EDIT:** I still get messages sometimes so I thought I'd leave an update. Unfortunately I had a brief relapse last fall after step 2 - ironic right? 

I quit again, and I've been free of it for almost 10 months now. I matched to one of my top choices for residency, and since I moved away I don't even have a plug anymore. But I gotta say, that little month-long stint sucked. Hated myself for it even when I was on it. It just goes to show the battle of will and addiction isn't necessarily gone for good even when you think you're over it. Always happy to chat with anyone about these experiences.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1buyve8/a_story_of_adderall_addiction_and_sobriety_in/

1kjzwd8,Are perpetual associate professors really a thing?,"My journey to tenure at an R1 had a lot of events:

My father died.

Then my brother died of cancer.

Then I was diagnosed with cancer. I didn’t tell my family—everyone was already grieving, and I couldn’t put more weight on them. I only told a small handful of people.

I went through radiation and chemotherapy during COVID. I was bedridden for months. I caught COVID during treatment.


After two years of remission, and trying to catch up my research and teaching, the cancer came back.


Around the same time (and probably due in part to my re-diagnosis), my wife experienced a manic episode and abruptly left me and our children. She filed for divorce and cut off contact.

I’ve been focused on getting my kids through this while going through another round of cancer treatment myself (surgeries and chemo)


Through some miracles (my dearest collaborators), i was able to stay productive enough throughout this to get tenure. But it really feels i inched over the finish line beat up and bruised in stark contrast to the running sprint i started with. I am just exhausted. I don’t feel guilty saying this: if I coast as a perpetual associate professor for the rest of my career, that’s fine. 

I’m not proactively writing grants for every possible program or opportunity I could contort my research program into. Besides, most of my research can be done at a chalkboard and laptop. I am taking my time writing the papers I want to write. My main channel of dissemination will probably be the arxiv apart from the few that get accepted into “diamond” open access journals or anytime an invite comes along for a special edition that waives APCs. I don’t plan on organizing anymore symposia or workshops, save for a few one-offs that my department or university may be running, or ones co-organized by friends.

Is this a viable/ethical professional existence?

1mklpar,Scrub Tech being borderline abusive,"Im a 4th year on sub-I out of state. My family including my 1 year old child are back home and I miss them dearly but I have been pouring that into my rotation, working hard, being early, staying late. Have yet to have an <12 hour day. Generally I’m someone who gets along well with OR staff and have befriended lots of scrub techs/nurses over the past year of clinicals but from the first day scrubbing with this tech I knew it was going to be a nightmare.
When the other medical student with me and I went to introduce ourselves she ignored us. Flat out did not respond or say hello at all. Okay. We were at least 2 feet away from her table and she yelled at us to back off. Whatever. Then when we went to scrub in (after grabbing our own things) she said “uh-uh, I’m not having 2 med students scrub in. This isn’t a fucking day care.” I couldn’t believe it. One of the PA’s must have quietly said something to her because when the attending came in she ranted about how she isn’t allowed to say anything or protect her sterile field from medical students and made us look bad as if we said something to her which we didn’t. 

I’m on my second week now and I feel like I’m being bullied. She has somewhat chilled out on the other student (male) but still gets on me about everything I do. I am never supposed to come in the main doors, which is fine. Today I had to carry tons of supplies for a splint because our cart was in use in another OR. I came all the way around the back and she told me when I bring in casting supplies I’m SUPPOSED to use the otherwise forbidden main doors and had me carry these handfuls of stuff all the way around and through the main doors just because. This was among so many other things she has been on me about, it’s as if I can’t do anything without her correcting me in some way. 

I have been nothing but polite and gracious to her, greeting her in the mornings, saying please and thank you, not letting my agitation show but I’m getting exhausted. 

I think a lot of this is because I am a female and I am attractive (not trying to toot my own horn, but I put in effort and I know I’m at least above average looking.) I don’t know if there is a good solution, just ranting about how much it sucks to be trying your best, lonely away from home, sleeping very little, and bullied for 14 hours by someone for no reason other than she can. 


Update: I spoke to a resident about this. Found out she has been this way to students for years with numerous complaints but very little action done to change her behavior. She called another female  medical student a “puta” in front of her thinking she couldn’t understand (or simply not caring.) the resident stepped up and is speaking to the PD on our behalf.

1n3avor,"Scrub techs, whats the deal?","I dont understand. Almost every scrub tech I met on my surgery rotation were complete and utter jackasses who sadistically thrived off of the minutia of power they held over med students.

Many of them would literally SCREAM at students (for the most minor of things) and did cruel things to students. I understand maintaining sterility and a student should be corrected if there is concern for that, but what I experienced and saw was just bullying the med students.

One scrub tech made one student scrub his nails for 5 MINUTES straight - until his nails/nail bed literally started bleeding. One made a student put on 3 layers of scrub booties over his shoes, and he was walking around in the OR trying not to slip. One grabbed a students arm so hard it left a bruise. One refuses to gown med students, demanding students self gown because she is too lazy. I once overheard a few scrub techs sitting at the OR nurses station, laughing, imitating, and making fun of a nervous classmate of mine in the OR, and saying how embarrassing it was for her.

These are just a few stories from just my rotation cohort group.

They know students cannot do shit about it. These scrub techs have worked at the hospital for 30+ years, they are best friends with the attendings we scrub in with. So the attendings dont give a shit. The residents dont give a shit. Nobody gives a shit when the med students are treated like subhumans.

Nobody sticks up for the med student being literally bullied by expendable people who are insecure that in literally 2 years, this med student will be giving them orders. So they take advantage of these students while they can.

Genuinely made my surgery rotation utter hell working with 90% of scrub techs. 10% were really amazing, just great people. But the overwhelming majority were insufferable, insecure, egotistical, sadistic maniacs. There are serious issues with the scrub tech culture where they think this is okay. I slept 5 hours every night, waking up at 4am and sleeping at 10/11pm. I worked like a dog from 4:45am-7pm. I studied as much as i could from 7-10pm. I was chronically exhausted, mentally drained. So with all of that, you also have to deal with some low life scrub tech who is so insecure about their job, that they have to flex some temporary power they have over their future boss.

udqs3f,Not rich and in medical school,"I'm not looking to start a movement or throwing a pity party, but there's just never a good place to talk about this. I'll delete if this is widely misunderstood or unwanted. 

Medical school takes for granted the idea that people can just afford things. Taking for granted that you have a car, for example. Mandatory health insurance? Traveling for mandatory school assignments, rotations, away rotations? Not having a qualifying parent to cosign on a lease for preclinical year, clinical year, expensive exams, proessional memberships and then residency? 

I remember feeling lost in my first year because I didn't own a car. I had come from a city with good public transportation and was trying to live frugally. When I talked to the financial aid office about setting money aside from my loans to help get an affordable used car, I was told ""I don't think a car would be a good use of your loans."" Well, after taking that to heart, I probably spent half the cost of my used car on uber, and was exhausted from walking to/from school which took away from study time. I just couldn't understand how people just expect you to own a car, and how no one ever mentioned it throughout the application and interviewing process. I did not even know that I would be apartment hunting and trying to sign a lease with no income for 3rd year. 

Even class differences show in casual interactions with classmates. When your interests are walking, drawing, etc. and a surprising amount of people go skiing, travel, own horses, etc.

1hpb0l3,I got into my dream programme. Now I don’t want to go.,"I applied and got into 4 PhD programmes, all R1, including Ivy. I thought this was all I wanted in life, but now I find myself dreading the idea of doing a PhD. 

I was supposed to start last September, but had to defer a semester due to visa related reasons. Now I am due to start in a week, and I have my visa all set, I have a place to live sorted and my supervisor has been very supportive. However, I don't actually want to start my studies anymore.

There are multiple factors. Primarily, I have been dealing with a lot of health issues lately, and I feel very weak and exhausted. 

I will have to uproot my whole life, move to a different country, leave my flat that I own, and most importantly, leave my partner behind and do long distance for God knows how long.

I also have a stable, ok paying job, and the stipend will be a downgrade.

Of course none of this is new information to me, I knew what I was signing up for when I applied. But I don't think I am the same person I was when I applied anymore.

I do not want to let my supervisor down, I don't want to let everyone who helped me apply down, and I don't want to let myself down. I worked so hard to get here! But I honestly can't find any motivation within me anymore. There is only a week left to the start of the semester, and I haven't even started packing. I can't stop crying and I feel so sick all the time.

1k9812b,"If I can do it, you can do it","Not sure if this is encouraging or discouraging but I got my very first offer (top unicorn, FAANGMULA-level) on Friday April 26th. I applied in February, technical in Match and got team match -> offer in April this week. Stats: CS major from no name school (T400 lol).

Some advise off the top of my head:

* Make sure to ask for referral and network. This is crucial for Big Tech as cold apply only works if your resume is already really strong.
* If you have a target company, check out Linkedin profiles of those who got accepted to understand what the company is looking for. 
* Leetcode: 200 is a soft-cap for majority of companies (try to get to 400 if you want to target harder companies). Neetcode is amazing, cracking faang is good. Neetcode 150, Strivers A2Z are both good resources. Do problems by DS/Algo type and make you sure you understand it before moving on. Personally, I did around 400 and after that, I just keep re-doing past question for review.
* Don't cheat. I understand the temptation as it is a desperate market but from my experience and asking around, companies focus a lot on communication. For my interview, recruiter did not even ask me to share my screen but he asked me to explain the code every 5-10 seconds.
* Make sure you rest to avoid burn out. I started applying since June and only stopped applying after I got the offer this week. That said, don't just apply to every single thing. If you are nearing 1000+ applications, this shows you are just spamming, not applying anymore.

17f9dvu,Sunk 5 hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.,"Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about 25 hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at 1 just to go to clinical at 5. I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last 3.2 semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking 19 credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are 8 credits, my lab is 1 credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about 8 hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was 8 years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now.

1i60cre,I have long COVID and it's not improving,"The title says it all. I've had long COVID since 2021. I have cognitive and physical symptoms. I'm exhausted all the time. I cannot work the standard 8 hours a day. When I work 5-6 hours daily, I am so tired that I struggle the next day. I have brain fog, struggle to initiate tasks, make mistakes even when I double-check my work, and have trouble focusing. I've almost stopped conducting research entirely. My teaching had gone from award-level to mediocre. My student evaluations have plummeted. I struggle to keep lectures succinct and grading takes an inordinately long time. I'm still able to do a good job with class discussions and explaining material, as well as mentoring.

I've consulted multiple specialists and they have yet to offer an effective treatment that improves my symptoms, never mind get rid of them entirely. I've lost hope that there will be any improvement. My chair and many of my colleagues know that I have long COVID, but they don't understand how bad it is because I appear normal. At the same time, COVID has downplayed to such an extent that I worry I appear lazy, sloppy, and incompetent. I am honestly trying my best and wearing myself out.

Instead from day 1 I was thrown into the frail with my supervisor expecting me to be already performing experiments and mastering the equipment as if I were already independent, and I'm expected to work overtime and produce results soon.

When I say that I don't know how to perform one experiment he says that he doesn't care, just look at a manual or protocol online, and see next week for the results. My supervisor only shows up to give new tasks, psychologically manipulate me into working more, and comment about how bad the reports I write are, and the data presentation, and the poor data itself. Nobody ever explained me anything on how to prepare good ones. I don't know how to improve my data without even knowing what I'm doing wrong, or when I'm told ""this is wrong do X instead"" but I actually did X!

It is miserable and miserable every day more than the precedent, and I'm feeling consumed and exhausted

even Olympic athletes of individual sports, who are hard pressured into getting outstanding achievements and can be very selfish, have trainers following them for training sessions, diet, psychological conditioning etc. and I don't think that swimmers start by being thrown into the water and expected to learn how to do 100m freestyle in a week, with others being sarcastic if they don't swim all the day every day.

My colleagues and seniors never ever assisted me. They complain when I ask if I can borrow something, because I didn't prepare some materials. They might enjoy sometimes explaining me if I ask one procedure, because they feel empowered, but the second time they tell me to just look at protocols online. Which are often contradictory without explanations, but my colleagues won't share their protocols for the same exact procedures. 

My colleagues too are often contradictory, sometimes they give me totally opposite indications, and my supervisor doesn't want to be bothered with such questions because he is busy.

They never told me whenever I did something wrong or I missed something, even if they knew it, and never cared to ask how things were going. If I take too time under the hood they start to complain, but if I politely ask when they will finish they answer annoyed that they are still busy.

They work more than 12 hours in the lab, even during weekends, and they always decline any recreational activities in the weekend when proposed. We never discuss if these habits are right or wrong, but when we mention the different timings, they sometimes assume condescending attitude with me. One particularly uses a sarcastic tone when he says that during the weekend he already prepared something that I wanted to prepare on Monday for our planned experiments, as if I were lazy or not good enough.

My supervisor said that I'm not requested to do the same, nor they are, they do that on their own ""because they have more determination"". Implying I do not have determination. I should really always go overtime if I want to have success in this career, ignoring what I consider to be healthy working regulations or a personal life? 

The academic staff often suggested to put health first and don't overwork, but my supervisor never complains if we work overtime and sacrifice ourselves. He better regards those who do, often mentioning how John Smith was really impressive when working overnight just to finish a draft. When he says that my data is poor, and lacking, and I say that I'm planning to do this and that experiments for the next weeks, he starts to mention that there are deadlines or that I'm already lagging behind and I can't graduate if I don't conclude everything in time, unless I accept to work for free another year or two.

I feel as if I weren't worthy enough, because I'm not sacrificing enough my health and private life.

Hello,

I am currently two months away from my preliminary candidacy exams and approximately 1 - 1.5 years  from graduation. I have a supporting supervisor who believes in me and a decent research topic.

The issue is…. I am completely exhausted. I’ve had to push myself HARD both mentally and physically to get to this point and my discipline, persistence, and stamina are fading away like water slipping through my fingers.

I’ve never been the smartest dude in the room but I’ve always managed to make up for it with grit, early mornings,  and late nights which unfortunately have taken their toll on my mental and physical health. In the last weeks I’ve found myself producing mediocre work and struggling to get stuff done. Tasks that seemed easy during my M.S. degree years ago seem like a Goliath these days.

I also don’t think I have the stamina to prepare for my preliminary exams ( I have two months) which has me worried and I am scared to fail.

Additionally, I am experiencing symptoms of imposter syndrome, which are destroying my self-confidence.

A lot of the things I want are on the other side of this program, and I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP. I have invested 9 years of my life to get to this point.

Just finished grading papers for an experiential learning class that I'm teaching. I'm teaching a local history course geared towards gen-ed students, who are mostly 19-20 year olds. The assignment requires that the students visit a local historic site and document their experience.

Over 30% of my 60 students received a D or an F on this paper. This is absolutely unprecedented in the years I've been teaching this class. They did not follow the instructions - often using generative AI to write their papers. Even worse, hardly any of them actually visited their chosen site... and didn't seem to care.

The assignment details have been available since the beginning of the semester. I went over the requirements three times in class. I provided them with examples of previous student work. I gave them a work day to go visit their site, research, ask questions, etc.

I care about their success, and make that clear throughout the semester, but I was **literally sobbing in frustration and disappointment by the time I finished grading.**

Not with the research part but by the University rules. I joined a few months ago and I have come to the realisation that I cannot go home or anywhere else until the PhD is over.

The minimum PhD duration here is 3 years and 6 months, so even if it's Einstein himself doing PhD, Manipal University won't let that person leave before the minimum duration is over that's not big problem but when coupled with having no vacation formally or informally and no Medical leave it becomes problematic.

You only get 1 leave per month ( From the day you join to the day you finish )

How can you go somewhere with just 1 leave per month? Travelling to my home town by train needs minimum 20 hours in train ( Airplanes I cannot afford with the stipend I get, here gets paid 350$/month). There is no other leave too, other than Saturday Sunday ( Some Saturdays are working too )

Even If I take one extra day due to sickness even with medical certificates, my pay gets deducted and my PhD gets extended by the days I skipped . So double penalty ( Time and Money )

All this is monitored by facial biometric attendance too, and if you don't clock 8 hours 30 minutes every day an email goes to your guide and dean, last week one day I only did 8 hours 27 minutes and a mail went to my guide and Dean.

I have no option to quit either, if I do, I have to pay back all the stipend I have received so far and they took all my original documents with them won't give them back unless I pay.

This honestly feels like a trap now. I lost all my ambition, I just want to finish it and run away. There is also a rule to publish 2 papers to be eligible to write thesis, all with guide as the corresponding author.

Now it feels like we are here to just make sure the guides get more papers and the university gets higher QS ranking. ( This university is ranked in the Top 5 in India and is in 800s in QS rankings. )

The sad part is my guide who recently went on vacation for 40 days wanted me to go for vacation too, but the university rules does not allow that. He even asked the university.

Guide holds absolutely no power when it comes to leaves, attendance funding or anything. He is just there to review your research.

I had never known PhD to be like this. All the "" A day in the life of a PhD Scholars"" looked like it had much for freedom.

I m ready to work straight 18 hours a day for 5 days in a week when I feel like it and want to work just 5 hours some Fridays or Mondays. Or Maybe take a 5 day break once a year to relax. Nothing is possible.

Even the timing is strict. You have to leave the campus by 6:00 in the evening, unless you have written permission, otherwise you are fined for staying late.

I don't know guys, is it just my university or is PhD like this at least somewhere else in any part of the world?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1lsbi9y/is_there_no_break_once_you_start_till_you_finish/
1l7fuxb,I cant get hired anywhere,"Hey everyone. I'm (M,21) am currently saving up money over the summer for an apartment for the school year off campus.

1lgnmwf,"Good EPAs, Great face-to-face feedback, Failed me for the rotation","I'm exhausted and need to vent. This all happened today so I am still figuring out options and next steps. 

Turns the preceptor of my last rotation failed me. Our evaluations on are a scale of 1-4 for different competencies. Any portion graded as a 1 = automatic fail. The preceptor gave me a 1 on two competencies, a 3 on one competency, and 2's for everything else. There are 14 competencies total. This was a complete blindside. 

I actually loved rotating with them. We had a great rapport. I got along well with staff and patients. I believed my preceptor liked and knew me well enough to ask them for a letter of recommendation and they agreed.

During the last week, they filled out all of the EPAs for me. The EPAs don't count toward my grade but they cover several of the same competencies. I looked at those for the first time today. My preceptor gave me high grades and good comments for each EPA, but scored me poorly for those exact same competencies on my graded evaluation that goes toward my MSPE.

Some of the competencies include: History, Physical, EHR, Communication with Staff, Communication with patients, etc.  The 2 competencies they gave me a 1 for were: Knowledge and Commitment to learning. 

My immediate dean called the hospital and their office to ask about my time there. The staff raved about me. They were extremely complimentary about me to him and said they would love to have me back anytime.

My dean also called my preceptor to see if there was an error or miscommunication. My preceptor affirmed to him that they intended to fail me. I don't know anything additional they said after that.

The whole evaluation was just objectively not true. I don't know why my preceptor turned like this. It all feels malicious.

5 of the 14 evaluation competencies overlap with the individual EPAs where my preceptor scored me highly and left good to very positive comments. Whenever I asked my preceptor directly if I needed to improve anything, they always said ""you are at an appropriate level for where you are in your education. you are doing great."" During long break in-between cases, I was either practicing the skills they showed me how to do or studying on my laptop. I asked a variety of questions regularly. I never had access to their institution's EHR so why not score 'N/A'. Continuing with this point, several of the competencies I did not have the opportunity to do with this preceptor yet they scored me poorly. This preceptor did not allow me really any independence or to provide direct patient care. I was only allowed to take and present 2 patient histories to them over the whole 4 week rotation.

The written comments on the evaluation even contradict the scores given. They wrote ""has a willingness to learn"", but scored me a 1 on commitment to learning. They wrote ""is kind to patients and staff"" and scored me a 2 on communication with patients and staff. They wrote ""needs to work on a more professional tone when delivering content"" and scored me a 3 on professionalism.

I just don't understand. I called one of my classmates who rotated with the same preceptor. They said they had a horrible relationship with their staff, probably was less engaged than me because they hated the rotation, and they have a great evaluation from the same preceptor.

My options are a committee meeting where I have to make my case to a virtual meeting of silent faculty staring at me. The committee decides if I am allowed to repeat the rotation or not.  
Or I can submit a grade appeal and hope for the best. My school has a high threshold for grade appeals though and I do not know how they work for appealing an evaluation.

I just don't want to have a rotation failure on my residency applications that was not true.

13zshnb,When Breath Becomes Air- By Dr. Paul Kalanithi,"As I sit here, sobbing that I can’t believe the book is actually over, I wanted to share with you all the excerpts I pulled from the book (although I know basically everyone has probably heard of it.) My school assigned us this book but I’m glad they did. If you have read the book, feel free to comment what you thought or even words of support for anyone else who’s read the book. It is a rough read but I, in fear of sounding cheesy, feel more committed to my future in medicine after reading it. I cannot imagine how or why terminal lung cancer had to happen to him, but in the words of Dr. Kalanithi himself- “why not him?”

I chose these quotes because they spoke to me the most. I am frankly too non-philosophical to understand the more complex philosophy in the book. He captures the physician-patient relationship, or how he saw it, more eloquently than I ever thought possible. What is our role, really? If you are feeling cynical, angry, exhausted, maybe the book can help. Sorry this is so long but I just felt compelled to share. 

QUOTES - When Breath Becomes Air

“Seeing the body as matter and mechanism is the flip side to easing the most profound human suffering. By the same token, the most profound suffering becomes a mere pedagogical tool.” 50 

“All at once, it dawned on her and she began to cry: wherever this ‘practice EKG’ had come from, the patient had not survived. The squiggly lines on that page were more than just lines; they were ventricular fibrillation deteriorating to asystole, and they could bring you to tears.” 51 

“What a call to make. In my life, had I ever made a decision harder than choosing between a French dip and a Reuben? How could I ever learn to make, and live with, such judgement calls? I still had a lot of practical medicine to learn, but would knowledge alone be enough, with life and death hanging in the balance? Surely intelligence wasn’t enough; moral clarity was needed as well. Somehow, I had to believe, I would gain not only knowledge but wisdom, too. After all, when I had walked into the hospital just one day before, birth and death had been merely abstract concepts. Now I had seen them both up close.” 66 

“And as I sat there, I realized that the questions intersecting life, death, and meaning, questions that all people face at some point, usually arise in a medical context.” 70

“In that moment, all my occasions of failed empathy came rushing back to me: the times I had pushed discharge over patient worries, ignored patients’ pain when other demands pressed. The people whose suffering I saw, noted, and neatly packaged into various diagnoses, the significance of which I failed to recognize-they all returned, vengeful, angry, and inexorable.” 85

“A tureen of tragedy was best allotted by the spoonful.” 94

“Openness to human rationality does not mean revealing grand truths from the apse; it means meeting patients where they are, in the narthex or nave, and bringing them as far as you can.” 96

“The word hope first appeared in English about a thousand years ago, denoting some combination of confidence and desire.” 133

“The physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have been disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.” 166

“Emma hadn’t given me back my old identity. She’d protected my ability to forge a new one.” 166

“If time dilates when one moves at high speeds, does it contract when one moves barely at all?” 197",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/13zshnb/when_breath_becomes_air_by_dr_paul_kalanithi/

xdjuh0,Extremely Disruptive Class. Should I escalate to the Dean?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Right now I am taking a very challenging morning math course and there is a group of about 8 guys who all seem to have known each other previously and they are so extremely loud that is very disrespectful to not only the professor but for the rest of the students. This has been happening since day one of school and I had immediately reached out to the professor which he did not reply to the email but I think he read it because the following day he attempted to quiet down the group.

&#x200B;

They often loudly side talk, mimic/mock the professors accent, make unfunny jokes to amongst themselves (making sure to laugh very loudly in the process), and explain the material to themselves while the professor is already in the process of doing so. 

I have already reached out to the professor once but I am absolutely miserable in this class and I dread going to it because of this group. I can barely even hear. I am sure I am not the only student that feels this way because I often look around and see annoyed and exhausted faces while they are being disruptive.

Should I escalate this situation to the department dean? I cannot go through the next several months attending class like this.

Edit: I would also like to add that I have classes with this group 5 days a week. 4 days a week for the lecture, 1 day for the lab.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xdjuh0/extremely_disruptive_class_should_i_escalate_to/

I should’ve said no but he cornered me last day of class and was really insistent- I was exhausted, sick and just wanted to go home so after badgering me, I regrettably agreed to be a reference. 

Unless his parents make some donations I don’t see him getting into this school, even if I lied and gave him a glowing recommendation. 
I also feel like giving a negative reference that screws him is unprofessional- I should have just declined the request if I wanted to sandbag him. But I’m also not going to lie for this kid. My initial thoughts were to use a few key words to emphasize his great personality and energy, but also highlight he still has “room for growth” with the basics like deadlines, attendance and participation. I think his GPA alone would sink his application, and I’m submitting it directly to admissions so don’t think he will ever see it.

w71m0h,How do PhD students actually survive on the stipend?,"I am ~exhausted~ of being broke. 24m, I’m considering applying to 1 PhD program this year (only accepts students every 2 years) and then maybe some others or MD PhD programs next year. 

I just don’t understand how you can survive on these stipends in 2022 and on. For context: I don’t come from a wealthy family and I have around $45,000 in undergraduate debt (fairly average number), and I have a post-bach position that pays as well as anyone at this level could get paid in academia, around $50k salary in basically the cheapest city in the country. I am barely scraping by. I don’t buy anything frivolous, I haven’t taken a vacation in years, I don’t even have a car payment. I have a dog which costs me around $60 per month, I work full remote and don’t pay for gas often, I bike when I can. How is anyone on a PhD stipend getting through this? I can’t save money now, more than a few hundred per month at best. Which seems like it will always get negated by a car repair or some emergency - much less on a $35-40k stipend. Given of course, I even get into a program. My undergraduate GPA was abysmal because I worked full-time all through undergrad to support myself. I’m otherwise a strong candidate, with above-average technical skills. 

I love my field (computational neuroscience) so much, and I want more than anything to be able to make a life studying it and contributing to it, but I am honestly so bitter and disappointed in the opportunity cost of getting a PhD. The skill set for this field is near identical to data science in industry, where statisticians regularly make over $100 or even $120k annually.

I feel sick to my stomach when I think about not being able to save money for another ~5 years. I want a house someday, or at least an apartment with basic amenities (a bedroom door would be nice). I want kids someday, probably when I’m around 30. I want to be able to finally take a fucking vacation.

My parents are struggling, and there’s a pending deal to shut down my dad’s plant (steelworker) a year before his expected retirement. I can’t bank on them backing me up financially. I want a gf, a wife someday - I’m embarrassed at how little money I stand to make in academia for the next 5 years. 

I don’t care about having a fancy car or new house, I just want basic security enough to live a regular fucking life. I’m so sick of this. I feel myself getting closer to selling out, and working for big pharma or an enterprise I think is unethical, because I don’t know how I can make this life work in academia. I feel like all my rich PIs have been a trick, a mirage of financial freedom at the end of a tunnel that keeps getting longer. 

Sorry for being so negative. I want this to work, I want to be able to just reason and logistics my way through it. Any thoughts / advice are welcome. 

TLDR; am broke, hoping not to sell out

Edit:

Thanks for all the thoughts and comments, I'm grateful for the input from those in better and worse conditions than me. I have a lot to be thankful for, and surely live with a lot more luxuries than I probably expressed here. I shouldn't have said I am ""broke"", though it can feel that way if you're surrounded by wealthier friends and family. I think I'll be cutting back on some of my privileges to, as one commenter put it, ""take the edge off"". Rock climbing membership is the first to go, it's super expensive and I like working out but I can do it a lot more cheaply, at home or planet fitness or wherever. Much respect to all those students and academics who are raising kids, living much more frugally than I do - I have a lot to learn from you folks. Thanks to everyone who has been patient discussing the complexities of refinancing student loans and the likes.

1kl5m9j,Should I drop out of my PhD?,"looking for advice, thought this group would be helpful. 

To preface: I’m exhausted, depressed, defeated, and about to fall asleep so apologies if I just sound whiny. It’s very difficult to put this into words

I (23F) started my PhD about 9 months ago and it’s been one of my biggest regrets. 

I used to love science and have conducted research for a few years at this point, so I decided to start my PhD right out of college. I chose to attend a university that I knew I would hate, but I really wanted to pursue this research.

When I interviewed with my PI she was really nice and understanding, but the day I started everything changed. She yells at us constantly, whenever we ask her questions she says “Why should i help? I have my PhD” and makes us cry daily. 

ALL of the lab members hate her and are actively trying to get out of the lab, even the international kids with 0 options. 

This woman says:
-we are not entitled to time off
-we are not entitled to lunch breaks
-we are not entitled to “free time” (weekends and nights)
-If we have a doctors appt we have to put those personal details on a lab calendar so EVERYONE knows where we are (had to let me know lab know I had an OBGYN appt…)
-if you come in even 2 minutes late she screams at you in front of everyone
-she keeps each of us in her office for 8+ hours a week for “meetings” then complains when we don’t have data done (bc we can never be at the bench)

As a result of this, I haven’t even made any friends or socialized at school so I never have anyone to talk to. I just go home and cry all night until I fall asleep. 

I’ve also developed such bad anxiety that I throw up every morning before work even after taking clonapin. it’s come to the point that if I even walk past my PI at school I start having a panic attack. 

It’s so sad because I loved my old lab, I would voluntarily spend saturdays and xmas there bc I just loved it so much. I left lab feeling so proud of my work every day. In my new lab I leave crying daily. I’ve never left my lab feeling proud or happy about the day I just had.

I just don’t know how I’m supposed to do this. My family lives 20 hours away. I’m just so isolated and discouraged I don’t even feel like showing up to work tomorrow,,,or ever again. 

It’s also upsetting bc i struggled for years with mental health and finally got to a good place, it took this lady ~6 months to bring me back to square 1.

any advice is appreciated. please be kind im really struggling right now. thank you.

also, what is ombudsman (i think im spelling it wrong)? When i was googling what to do about this that word popped up and a few people mentioned it in the comments. 

For anyone wondering why I haven’t quit already:
-i moved from new england to the midwest (0 friends or family here)
-don’t really have a lot of savings (grad student stipend!!)
-i’m very concerned about the current job market
-this woman has ruined my confidence to the point where Im too scared to even do a PCR.
-I’m the first person in my family to pursue a PhD (mostly engineers and business in my family) and they would be so so disappointed if i didn’t finish.
-my boyf is a PhD and his parents are MDs…i rly don’t wanna be the stupid one ya know?

UPDATE: I went to work the next day and something happened in lab (not a huge deal tbh) but my boss screamed at me and made me cry. instead of giving me a minute to gain my composure she said “get it together because grad student awards are now.” I got to the awards ceremony but there were so many people and I was so visibly upset I ended up having a panic attack.
While hyperventilating in the bathroom the head of student wellbeing heard me cry and took me to have a meeting with the wellbeing/ombudsman center. 
I think someone higher up may have had a talk with my PI as my cohort, professors, committee members, and dept heads all saw me start having a panic attack. My PI told me to take the week off.

The surgeon had his arms uncovered. The CRNA had his arms uncovered. The circulator had her arms uncovered. All were physically closer to the patient than I was.

Although I have published two journal papers, I haven't passed the university's internal thesis review. I am now in my fifth year of the PhD program. I'm struggling mentally, and a Japanese PhD student in my surroundings has already quit.

There are many excellent Indian, Bangladeshi, and Chinese international students around me. However, only Chinese students cannot graduate and must repeat years. My Japanese advisor, who is the department head, seems to discriminate against Chinese students. For example, he says that both of my published papers are low-level and that even undergraduate students could write them if they wanted to.

His influence in the department is powerful. If I make even a minor mistake, he reports it to all ten other professors in the department. He consistently ignores or undervalues my research. For the first three years, I was angry about this treatment, but now I'm just exhausted. I am currently taking medication for adjustment disorder as diagnosed by a Japanese psychiatric hospital.

18eatdg,Choosing to do a PhD has been one of the worst mistakes of my life,"I love my research (mass comm, focus on social media and health) but I have never felt more alone and broken in my entire life. These have been the worst three years of my life as I have had to navigate a program that is extremely toxic, competitive, full of gaslighting, and where if you don’t constantly beg or apologize you will be punished in some way. I have been demeaned in group settings. I get snarky comments if I ask for help or clarification, if I get help at all. 

I got pregnant my first semester of the PhD. I thought I was going to have a beautiful family and career. Wrong. My ex husband abandoned me, pregnant, a thousand miles away from all of my friends and family. I have a beautiful little boy. I had him in the summer and went back to the PhD when he was six weeks old. Imagine taking care of a newborn and pumping in a PhD program BY YOURSELF. I’m fucking exhausted mentally and physically every single day. I got sexually assaulted on campus, the individual still works there with no repercussions that I know of. I have an eating disorder and while I was healthy during pregnancy and postpartum, it got MUCH WORSE this past year. I have had to go to the hospital multiple times. I worked on coursework and attended research meetings in the hospital. I had a feeding tube on my face and I still came to campus for all of my TA duties and most of my classes. “Put your health first” but every email or conversation makes it clear the expectation is that the PhD has to come before my health or even my child. 

While in this program I have published and presented at multiple conferences and workshops, one even being an international conference while I was breastfeeding and took my son with me. Despite my difficult pregnancy and anorexia almost killing me twice this year, I have met basically all goals and expectations of the program. I am only one semester behind compared to peers. I have more publications coming out. But I feel like they don’t see any value in me as a scholar or colleague. I’m just seen as the whiny anorexic woman with a baby. 

How do I get through this? I’m intelligent enough and have the work ethic to earn a PhD, but I literally cry on my drive to campus because its such a negative place and idk how to emotionally get through this. I need to get through this for my little boy. For our futures. I have an amazing therapist at least, but it feels far too late to transfer.

EDIT: I’m located in the USA. I’m from Memphis, TN but I’m very much not in Memphis now. 

EDIT AGAIN: 
1) Thank so many of you for the kind words. I am supposed to enter treatment for my eating disorder on Monday, praying my LOA request gets approved.
2) This post is not about my ex husband or to discuss the details of my marriage. 
3) My institution is known for being extremely toxic and “cult like” and for covering up sexual misconduct by employees and I unfortunately did not know this when I interviewed a trusted former colleague who said it was “amazing.”
4) I do NOT regret having my child at all. I immediately began planning for how to take care of him when I found out I would be on my own and figured it out (WIC, childcare assistance, etc). I am seeking mental help to be a better parent but my child is thriving physically and emotionally. I put him first but to an extreme. I go to the PhD all day and then come home to make him dinner and try to teach him to talk/deal with tantrums appropriately and then it’s bath and bedtime stories and goodnight kisses. I’ll never regret this, even on his most misbehaved days. He is not a mistake and anyone suggesting that he is should be ashamed of themselves. He’s a beautiful, smart, confident, cuddly little 17 month old boy and I would die for him. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/18eatdg/choosing_to_do_a_phd_has_been_one_of_the_worst/

But the cake, within 3 days of class starting I have a new rate my professor. Apparently I am an evil bastard that is full of himself because my pre-quizzes are pass/fail and I have zero objectivity because I wrote the book for my course.   


To say the review is less than Steller is an understatement.  


Now why are they the dumbest students? Well the pre-quiz are pass/fail. If you take it, you pass. If you don't take it you fail. Which was explained to them multiple times, including the instructions where you open the quiz, and a video.   


Also we have a discussion board at the end of each module. Guess which student decided to reuse his review of me, and repost as a discussion board post. Then in the discussion board post refuse to do any of the rubric pieces because ""hell nah I aint doing that"".   


I have had more questions over basic level shit, that they should know coming into the course than at any point in my 18 year career history. Three days in and more entitlement and unprofessional emails/calls/texts/etc that I have received in the entirety of my career combined.

I just started my PhD program recently and my attention span has gone to shit because of my excessive screen time. I'm in my first semester so I'm taking classes, doing lab rotations, and am involved in one extracurricular. With class, lab, then sometimes my extracurricular, when I actually have free time I usually end up doom scrolling on my phone or watching movies on my TV because I'm so exhausted. I cannot bring myself to use my time in a healthy fashion and the excessive screen time is taking a toll on my attention span and making it harder to study. I compulsively feel like I need to check my phone on instagram, reddit, etc every couples minutes or so. It's really frustrating me.

I still try to hang out with my friends and do small workouts so my physique doesn't completely go to shit, but I definitely gained some unhealthy fat since starting my program. When I was working my previous 9-5 job, I religiously trained martial arts after work and was able to do healthy stuff like reading or adult coloring books when I wasn't going to the gym and then have one day a week where I went crazy with screen time.

1maqd0x,"My advisor left me after I came back from medical leave, and I'm devastated","Looking for people's thoughts on this situation :) 

TLDR: I just got back from 9 months of medical leave (I had undiagnosed autism, and I burnt out), I'm post-candidacy, and I've worked with my advisor for 5 years. Our first post-leave meeting, he told me he's not sure about working with me anymore, and went as far as telling me that he'd vouch for me to a new advisor. I didn't expect this at all, and I feel devastated. Do I try to show him that I can do better? Do I just cut my losses?



Longer explanation: for the first three years I worked with my advisor, we had a great relationship. He even supported me in taking it easy when I got PTSD my second year. During my fourth year, things started to feel tense because I couldn't get him drafts fast enough. I was able to pick up speed a bit once I got an ADHD diagnosis and was properly medicated, but it still wasn't enough for him.
In my fifth year, things were civil, but a little ugly. I was exhausted, he was always telling me that I wasn't working fast enough, and I was increasingly demoralized. It seemed like, ""everyone else can meet these deadlines -- why can't you?"" I eventually brought in a mediator because it seemed like we were talking past each other. That year, we scheduled my defense three different times, but I just couldn't get things finished.
Going into my sixth year, he said he wasn't sure what to do with me and thought I should maybe transfer to a different lab. I pointed out how much faster I'd begun to work (I had just needed more writing practice). He said he'd give me one more semester of funding, and that I'd have to self-fund after that. Fair to me!
Well, a month later, I totally burnt out. It was such an awful feeling, but I told him I should go on medical leave because my brain just wouldn't work anymore. He was supportive, we developed a plan for when I got back, I told him I'd fund myself moving forward, we both *signed an agreement* basically saying we were committed to each other, and then I took 9 months to take care of myself and recover. 
In that time, I also got an autism diagnosis, which helped me to understand why I had burnt out (four years of numerous leadership roles, non-stop communication, and developing a paper?? How could I not burn out!).
I'm coming back from medical leave now, and I'm *jazzed*. I developed a new graduation timeline, I made a huge list of what I need to finish, and I felt SO prepared to get back to it.
I sent him my timeline, and thought he'd appreciate that I was being proactive.
Turns out that I... Missed something? When we met, he told me it actually made him worried that I sent him the timeline, I was being too eager, the timeline was too aggressive, and I was just repeating mistakes I've made before.
I told him that I'm happy to adjust the timeline, but also that I have way more energy than I did before because I had rested for 9 months. 
He kept repeating that he just ""doesn't feel confident"" about working with me.
Finally, through tears I said, ""it seems like there's nothing I can do to help you trust me other than showing you that things are different. And I don't want to be in a situation again where I can tell that you don't think I can do this. That's not good for either of us.""

I stand by what I said, but now I feel torn between so many thoughts: 

1) over time, I've become furious that he would even consider abandoning me. My brain broke because I had numerous undiagnosed disabilities. But up until it broke, I absolutely kicked ass. I won awards, I started new clubs, I got more support for grad students in my department, and I even took over planning a conference for him. So a big part of me is like, ""f--k him. I deserve people who stick with me, even when things are hard.""

2) I'm worried that I must have really messed up somehow without realizing it. I'm incredibly anxious, so I'm very self-reflective. I don't think I was ever out of line when I tried resolving our previous issues. It seems like he must have really gotten sick of me though if he decided to give up on me after I came back from medical leave...

3) should I try to convince him to work with me again because that probably my fastest route to graduating? Or is it going to feel gross because now I know how little he values my work? 
   
4) Also... Is this ableism? It's hard to look at all this and not think that he ditched me because I wasn't able to keep up my cheery and easygoing demeanor once I started to burn out. 

5) should I take this opportunity to start ""fresh""? I didn't really like my research anyway, but all of my chapters are kind of written already. Do I hop over to a related field, but scrap some of what I have? I feel like I'll be looking at another three years of work if I go that route, but I might actually enjoy it.

This whole thing just feels really icky and confusing. We used to get along so well, and he was so chill and understanding. Now it seems like he's cold. I don't know if I should fight for him, yell at him, or leave quietly.

13oth18,The (hopeful) end of the saga,"Hi, reddit friends, you might remember my recent greatest hit about my student telling me they needed to pass the class because it would be good for their mental health and also a good Mother's Day present. 

WELL.  

The deadline for course work was x day at midnight. This had been on the syllabus since day one.  For the last two weeks, I brought up the deadline at the beginning and end of every class.  I posted three Announcements on the CMS stating the due date and that 'No work can be accepted after this deadline!' 

Student...blew the deadline.  Allow me to share the highlight reel: 

""I will do anything if you accept my work I have money, I can pay you."" 

""I know you say you want to be fair to all the students and that's why you can't accept late work but I need you to be fair to ME because I am a student and you can't be fair to students and not be fair to me.""

""You say you want students to succeed but you don't care you only want your fat paycheck and don't care because you've got your money""

""If I don't get an A in this class you will be very sorry now please open the dropbox for me to submit this work I am asking you nicely, and I said please so I'm not being rude at all.""  

And then the piece de resistance: 

""If I don't get an A in this class I will have to lie to my parents about passing the class because I will not be safe physically in my house if I don't pass this class.""

At this point, the Dean of Students had to get involved.  Can you imagine, seriously, if you're a parent and you get a call from the dean of your kid's school, asking questions implying that you abuse your child? OMG!!!

klm97k,"7th-year PhD student, just diagnosed with ADHD after my advisors intervened when I was seriously struggling. I'm grateful to them for not giving up on me, because I was certainly ready to.","I want to share this because I felt extremely alone for a lot of this experience, and I hope that being open about it can help others who might be going through something similar.

I'm in my seventh year of a PhD program in the humanities; somewhere around year five or six, I started really struggling. I was done with the coursework and dissertation proposal stages of the degree and on to the pretty unstructured research/writing phase. I wasn't getting much writing done, but at first I was reassured by the fact that this seemed to be pretty normal; lots of other students told me that they didn't get much done in their fourth year and even fifth year, and that most of their writing happened in the last couple years of the program.

In year five, I got a grant that was intended to allow me to focus solely on research/writing. However, I got very little academic work done that year. I felt an increasing sense of paralysis as I stared at what was supposed to become my first chapter; it seemed inconceivable that I'd ever be able to turn it into anything resembling a legitimate dissertation chapter. Instead of working on writing it, I spent a lot of the time in the mountains (rock climbing, skiing, etc). At first I told myself that I was just trying to have some work/life balance, and that when it mattered, I'd be able to turn my focus to the dissertation; but as the year progressed, deep down I became increasingly doubtful.

Year six (2019-2020) was where things really got bad. Possibly partly precipitated by a traumatic experience I'd had over the summer, I began to totally withdraw. I couldn't even open my unfinished dissertation chapter. I stopped checking email because I was afraid of what I might see. I had to go to the department to teach, but I would hurry in and out to try to avoid interacting with anyone. I was supposed to submit an application for a dissertation completion fellowship in January 2020; I watched that deadline come and go passively, without even communicating to my advisors that I didn't think I could make it.

Meanwhile, other parts of my life were also deteriorating. There were a couple months where I didn't pay my rent, not because I didn't have the money but just because the process of writing the check and sending it to my landlord felt too overwhelming. Because I was completely avoiding my email at this point, I missed numerous communications from my landlord, and only by sheer luck happened to finally open my email shortly after he'd sent a message telling me that he would have to ask me to leave the apartment if I didn't pay immediately. My hygiene deteriorated, including on days when I had to teach, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had a couple small jobs outside the department, and I found myself increasingly unable to fulfill basic responsibilities (sometimes as simple as printing a poster out) there, too.

I felt like I was watching myself self-sabotage, but I couldn't understand why, or why I couldn't seem to even bring myself to really care. Every day I would wake up and tell myself that I'd turn things around; then I'd spend the whole day staring at distracting websites, feeling physically unable to bring myself to click on the email tab, much less open anything related to my dissertation. I felt constantly exhausted and guilty, and I began to withdraw from my social life because I couldn't admit what was going on to myself, much less to my friends. The one thing I did consistently manage to do was go climbing, which just made me feel more guilty: surely if I could motivate myself to get up at 5 am to go to the mountains, I should be able to print out a poster or mail a rent check, right?

I was also reminded of my experience in college: I'd struggled in all of my exam-based classes, making poor grades (including a couple failing grades) and feeling generally not in control of my life. The by all accounts successful ≈10 years between then and now didn't seem to matter; all I could feel was that the ""real me"" was a failure, and that everything in between was a fluke that was destined to fall apart sooner or later.

My advisors had been reaching out to me, but because I wasn't looking at my email I didn't see their communication. Finally, in February, a professor was able to give me a note in-person, which prompted me to finally look. I saw that I'd received a letter from the department telling me that there was concern about my progress, and that if I wasn't able to show two chapters by the end of the year, I'd be put on academic probation; if I didn't show two chapters by the end of the following year, I'd be asked to leave the program. I felt numb, surprised that they were giving me that much of a chance, and pessimistic about my ability to take advantage of it. Nevertheless, I wrote to my advisors to set up a meeting.

What surprised me was how kind they were at the meeting. Where I was expecting anger and disappointment, I instead saw concern. They acknowledged that I was struggling without pressing me to explain why, told me that they valued my work and wanted me to be able to continue to participate in the field, but also emphasized that the most important thing was for me to take care of myself and my mental health--whatever that might mean for my academic work. We talked through the letter and my options, and they gave me some on-campus resources to talk with.

(I want to acknowledge here that I know that this kind of response is unfortunately not the norm in graduate departments. I feel extremely grateful that my advisors were so compassionate, and very angry that many people have much more negative experiences when dealing with mental health issues in graduate school.)

I started working with a therapist, a psychiatrist, and an academic coach at my university. Pretty quickly they mentioned the possibility of ADHD. It wasn't the first time someone had suggested this (I had a couple therapists earlier in grad school who also suspected it), but it was the first time I began to take it seriously as something that might be affecting my work.

Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit they had to put a diagnostic evaluation (and any stimulant medication) on hold, but the psychiatrist did give me a prescription for Wellbutrin (known to help both depression and ADHD). Probably more importantly, the academic coach helped me develop strategies for managing focus and motivation. With their help (plus some pandemic-anxiety-induced hyperfocus...) I was able to finish my two chapter drafts, and even successfully applied retroactively for the dissertation completion grant that I'd failed to apply for in January. The academic progress was obviously important, but even more than that I felt immensely relieved to begin to feel capable again and not to feel like I had to hide from my own life.

The last chapter of this somewhat rambling saga came this month. After delaying dealing with it for several months, I finally made an appointment to be formally evaluated for ADHD. The doctor confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed me a low dose of Adderall. It's only been a week, but the difference is already striking. I feel way less dread about starting work on the dissertation each day, and as a result, competing distractions feel less compelling. When I do get distracted, it doesn't feel like a monumental effort just to navigate back to the Word document. Maybe most surprisingly, I feel less imposter syndrome about the coherence of my arguments now that I'm able to focus on re-reading more than a couple paragraphs of my writing at a time.

In retrospect, the ADHD diagnosis makes sense of a lot of things I'd always just seen as personal failings/quirks: my extreme spaciness as a kid; my chronic inability to keep my personal spaces tidy no matter how much I want to; my tendency to fixate on things seemingly irrespective of their overall importance (often at the expense of basic needs like food or water); my anxiety about the fact that my ability to write has seemed to depend on intense surges of motivation/inspiration; my tendency to forget what I'm doing midway through a task; etc. No one picked up on it when I was a kid because I was a well-behaved girl who didn't fit the stereotype for ADHD. And while I'd been aware that a lot of this stuff might be related to ADHD for a few years, what I didn't expect was to feel like there were concrete solutions that could give me a greater sense of self-efficacy and clarity.

At the beginning of this year, I wouldn't have imagined that this sense of competence and hope was possible for me. I didn't really feel capable of thinking about the future at all; if I did, I probably imagined that I'd be living with my parents after having had to explain how I'd managed to be kicked out of a PhD program that--up to a certain point--I'd been thriving in. I certainly didn't feel I deserved a second chance: instead, I felt that I'd already been given too many second chances and that I had finally shown my true character when I failed at this one. I was ready to give up on myself, and I'm so grateful that my department didn't let that happen.

While I was going through this, I felt incredibly alone and as though my failure was unique to me. It didn't matter that objectively I recognized that the stress of graduate school took a heavy toll on many of my colleagues; I was convinced that in my case, it was just because I wasn't good enough, and that I had squandered an opportunity I never deserved in the first place. I also felt deeply ashamed at just how much I was letting my life fall apart, and unable to talk about it to even my closest friends because of that shame.

I realize now that this shame was incredibly destructive. One of the first things that actually made me feel better was when the academic counselor I met with told me that she'd met many other students who, like me, had avoided looking at email for weeks or months at a time. I had felt so ridiculous for being unable to bring myself to do something so simple; knowing that other people had struggled with it, too, suddenly helped me see my own experience with more compassion. I've realized since that shame about academic failure perpetuates a culture of silence in which people often feel unable to talk about the extent of their struggles in academia--even when the topic of mental health is broached.

So, if you are going through similar difficulties (whether ADHD-related or something else), please know that you are not alone. No matter how badly you feel that you're failing, there are other people who have been there, too. You might feel like you deserve to suffer for your failures (I know I did), but what you truly deserve is compassion and support. You deserve to receive resources to deal with whatever may be causing your struggles so that you can live the life you want to live--whether that's in or out of academia. And if your advisors/department doesn't give you that support (which is sadly all too common), I hope you're still able to find someone who can step in, advocate for you, and remind you that you are worth it in those moments where you might not feel that way.

Thanks for reading through this mini-novel if you've gotten this far :) I hope it's helpful to at least a few people; I know it felt helpful to me to write it all out.

I would love to take care of myself and build some muscle but I genuinely don’t know when I would have time. 

I work at 4/5am 5 days a week, so I feel like during my other times I’m either trying to catch up on sleep or finish my homework. How do people do it?

1k7mhgu,Debating leaving academia,"I'm a non tenure track faculty member. I've been at my university for 13 years full time; I taught as an adjunct prior to that. I enjoy teaching, but I feel demoralized by dealing with my colleagues and departmental politics. Academia is so hierarchical and competitive; I'm exhausted by the way people posture, maneuver and perform. Yet I'm reluctant to leave because being a professor is a significant part of my identity.

17ijj1u,"So many of this year's first year students don't know how to ""college"" and I have no idea how to help them","I'm not sure if others are seeing this but I'm sure we all know the factors that have contributed to this trend. Students had an uneven experience in those years where accountability and self-reliance took center stage and/or by the time they got back into semi-normal classrooms, their teachers were just trying not to drown. 

I saw a lot of these trends the early weeks of class and really hoped they would have their ""oh this doesn't work in college"" moment but it's not really happening for a lot of them. I know there is only so much one can do and I'm doing a reasonable job of not exhausting myself trying to save them, but I am sincerely concerned about them and what they've come to see as ""normal."" 

I wouldn't say that the situations I've encountered this semester are the most egregious of my career by any means but rather, the most widespread. 

\- I am dumbfounded by the sheer number of students giving up easy points.  Assignments that are half completed and/or just ignore the directions. I have students who are failing my course by not turning in ""answer this question with your thoughts on it. There is no wrong answer"" responsive writing that they are given time in class to do. Literally just use the 10 minutes I give you. Hit ""post."" No idea what they are doing with that time but whatever it is must be worth failing over because those points add up.

\- Many of them have no real sense of time management and just sort of expect people to exempt them if they used their time badly or rearrange everything for them. Just an example: I gave students 4 days of in-class time to work on something that realistically should have taken them 2-3, which included needing to meet with a group and also me. Gave reminders that they ONLY had this time and to use it well. Still had a solid portion of the class who did nothing the entire time and then complained they didn't have enough time. Sent angry emails when they reached out at the last minute and I refused to drive back to campus at crazy hours the evening it was due to meet with them. They had reminders and plenty of opportunity to meet with me in class (or even my office hours... I offered that too) and most groups just didn't. They sincerely thought that if they wasted those 4 days I would say ""oh, obviously I didn't give them enough time... we won't do anything in class next week either so you can have more time."" 

\- The rudeness is just off the charts. I don't expect some type of reverence but just basic human decency. Yet, the same class exercises I've been doing for years, I now have students openly saying ""this is stupid... I'm not doing this"" or even thinking they are super clever and ""trolling"" and making fun of it rather than actually doing what they are supposed to thinking they are hilarious. I've had entire sections of students who simply ignored me when I asked them to discuss something and didn't pretend otherwise when I walked around to listen in. I asked one group what they talked about. ""How did your group answer this question?"" I asked. ""We didn't"" I was told before the student went back to staring at his phone. 

I could keep going. I have no idea how we fix this as a university (or maybe even a society) but something needs to happen. First year students always play a little bit of catch up with figuring out college but usually it takes one or two instances of lost points where they realize we aren't playing games. But maybe we are. I see my colleagues allowing retests and extensions over these types of things and I'm not sure that isn't part of the issue. We're all exhausted and it feels like an uphill battle but I don't think you turn the ship around by saying ""oh darn, we are headed in the wrong direction...meh. Might as well just go that way."" I don't blame my colleagues for surrendering, but it's certainly not helping. (And if I'm honest, I'm also tempted to say ""fine... whatever"" myself.)

I guess I'm partially venting, but I'm also really sincerely worried about them. Maybe it will just take them a little bit longer for it to sink in and they are on an uphill trajectory. Maybe? Hopefully.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/17ijj1u/so_many_of_this_years_first_year_students_dont/
1iydszi,Email from a parent,"I teach at a community college in California, and we have a large number of dual enrollment high school students. 

I am pretty clear that in my online classes, technology is not an excuse for not doing assignment assignments. 

Recently, a dual enrollment student was having significant difficulty submitting a video. He had heavily edited it, which was not allowed, and for some reason it was taking hours to upload before finally failing. I asked him to upload it to YouTube and send me the link, which he could not do. His tech problems have been going on for a week now, and I’m exhausted.

Today, his mother emailed me and stated her name as  Dr. So and so. First of all, don’t try to intimidate me with your doctor status. That does not interest me. 

Second, I really don’t appreciate having to answer to someone’s mother. The student did not reach out to tech-support like they were supposed to, and it’s frankly a violation of privacy laws for me to talk about particulars with a parent.

1ghud6j,Never Give Up Yall,"Hey everyone, 

Up until yesterday I've been struggling to get a job I would be satisfied with.

This all started back in Fall of 2022 where I got a final round interview with SIG. I was so escatic and studied my ass off for the technical interview. I ended up solving everything but was shocked to see I ended up not getting the offer. I was really sad because I was so hyped for the position. That year- I ended up going to work for Target as a SWE Intern.

The work at Target was great, but the pay and location was below industry average. I ended up declining my return offer and delaying my graduation date to lock tf in for another round of internship applications. During Fall of 2023, I got 0 interviews. I thought my resume was cooked or something, but after 15 Perfect OAs and 300+ job apps, I was left with nothing. Come Spring 2024, I finally heard back for the first time in a long time. Meta! They reached out to me for an OA for their Summer 2024 Internship. I was jumping up and down and was super motivated to do well on the OA.

Unfortunately, I ended up getting rejected after the OA part as I wasn't able to solve every question. I honestly got really sad since I really liked the company. Then, a few months before summer, Coinbase reached out to me with their OA. I did it, got to the final round for their frontend swe internship, and fumbled the bag so hard. I'm really good with React and somehow I cooked myself on some basic logic that I should have been able to solve. That spring/summer, I ended up going back to my old small company that kept me employed during that time. I am very grateful for them.

Come Fall 2024, I heard back from Capital One. This one... this one was cursed. The morning of my interviews, the power went out because some eagle fell from the sky and sniped my transformer. In response, I ended up yoloing my entire net worth on 0dte spy puts. (Don't ask me why - I had some problems ok). I ended up losing a decent chunk of it (12k) and had to somehow figure out how to do my interviews without power. So, my friend drove me to my gf's college and I did my interviews there with 2 minutes to spare. I aced my powerday and felt good that i was able to overcome such a crazy situation. I ended up somehow getting rejected anyways for God knows what reason. This one still baffles me to this day.

Around 2 hours after I got rejected by C1 I heard back from Figma for their internship. For context, I got into my masters program so i was applying to both internships and new grad jobs. I honestly thought Figma was super cool as I love their product so I locked in for their OA, got the final round, thought I did well but ended up getting rejected anyways. At this point, I thought I was cursed and was gonna never get a dream job.

Then, like a WWE wrestler coming back from Season 2, Meta responded to my new grad application. This time, I was ready for their OA. I spent every second of my days preparing myself. After passing the OA and getting the final round, I locked in harder than I ever did in my life. For 3 weeks, I woke up, leetcoded, ate, and went to bed. I got to the point where if you gave me any LC problem, there'd be a 90% chance I'll be able to solve it in under 20 minutes. After the final round, I felt exhausted. I did nothing for the next week besides rummaging through my Meta's portal, anxiously looking for GrapgQL insights. 

Yesterday, I heard back that I got an offer from Meta for their Software Engineer (University Grad) role. After all the shit I've been through, it's incredibly satisfying to accomplish something I thought I'd never get. I was able to turn down my AI masters program from GT and am happy that I no longer have to spend 40k self funding my post graduate education.

If there's anything to take away from the shit I've been through these past few years, it's to never give up on your dreams. I fought til the very end to get this offer, and I hope to whoever read this long ass post, it gives you the motivation to never stop trying.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ghud6j/never_give_up_yall/
1fzxpgb,Out of the woodwork ,"Someone please tell me what planet is in retrograde or astrological whatever is whatevering this week because I am about to move off grid and live in a yurt. 

In the past week alone I've had a student in my online class use the Discussion forum to insult other students and when I posted that I would have to change the Discussions so that I have to individually approve posts and offer an apology to the students he offended, he starts posting spam stuff including links i am sure are NSFW.

Another student blew the deadline to hand in an assignment and missed the built in extension period and only after getting the email about how he can no longer pass the class, he decides to act.  He's spent more energy in the last three days on fighting my policy than he has done the rest of the semester.  In my mandatory meeting with him and the chair he says he didn't hand in the paper because he was busy with his other classes and ""work and stuff"".  He made a scene at the end of class trying to get the other students mutiny or something. Which only made him more upset when no one joined him. 

Another student who has STILL not bought the textbook and also failed for not handing in a major project shows up today. I politely ask if he's checked his email (where I have explained the policy).  He says yes ""and I'll get that project to you soon.""  Um no. Clearly this is how he has worked his education thus far and apparently I'm a bad person for not letting him do this. 

Then at the end of my last class I had a student bright red and shaking in tears because he got....a C+.  He didn't include a major component of the assignment. He wants to grieve the grade. He told me he got a 92 on his math test and had a panic attack so bad that he had to call 911.  He suggested it would not be nice of me to make him call 911 again. 

I'm done yall. I'm so exhausted. I know most of these are generally nice kids who have just never been taught things like accountability or conflict resolution but this is an all new level of emotional labor on top of teaching and grading.  They are so smart when it comes to ways to manipulate or as we say in the South ""outhouse lawyer"" and if they used half of that energy in the actual work they'd be Rhodes Scholars.

1ftqtcj,My desire to teach was killed,"Yesterday, I was teaching one of the courses. For the lecture, it was kind of repetitive to wrap up the chapter. I went through the slides. Note that my slides are kind of bear bones slides where they need to fill in the blanks during the lecture. Anyway, I spent 50 minutes talking. Then, I gave them the worksheet to work on, which I always do. One of the students (he always asks questions but in a way that doesn’t relate to what I talk about or the questions that I just answered to another student), he asked for help. I went to his desk and see. He was not even asking questions just telling me how to solve the problem all in a wrong way. I’m normally very patient and willing to help them since I know it is hard for taking my students. However, while trying to understand what he is telling me, all of a sudden I felt a switch in me. My desire to teach or explain went away. I am not sure how to explain it, but I just didn’t want to be there. I have been teaching for more than 5 years and this was the very first time I just felt empty and didn’t want to explain things. In the past, even though I was exhausted I was always happy to help them. But I lost it yesterday. Instead of walking around the tables and helping them, -which I always do- I just solved the problems right away bc I wanted to get out asap. Did you have this feeling before? I was completely switched off and it’s a strange feeling. Help!

Edit: I have a course policy about email etiquette in my syllabus, I even had syllabus quiz at the beginning of semester.

1e0csmn,I graduate next year and I kinda don’t think I can be a software engineer,"So basically I got my first real internship this summer at a pretty well known company. Not known necessarily for tech but known in general. So this has been my first time programming large scale in a non academic setting and I just feel so so so bad at it. I had my mid-summer evaluation and I didn’t do bad at all anything but I still feel like shit. I feel like a fraud. I spend basically 8 hrs a day googling to try to figure how to do each part of my project just to meet with my manager and have him tell me it needs to be done a different way. So then I have to spend 8 more hours googling to fix the things he said along with an overhanging paranoia that I won’t finish in time (I’m alone on this project no programming team), and the team I’m working with are not programmers so they can’t really help me with the nuances.

I feel like I never know what’s being talked about. It takes me forever to figure out small simple bugs. It just feels like I’m constantly playing catch up only I never get close to catching up. I work 8-5 and I’m exhausted when I get home, and It feels like the only way i’ll ever understand even half of anything useful is devote my entire 5-9 to MORE programming and I simply can’t do that right now I might crash out.

And I’m not a bad student! The only programming class I’ve had less than an A in is Theory of Computation and I got a B. But programming outside of academia is completely different and my school didn’t prepare me at ALL.

I was planning on getting my masters regardless but what are some suggestions in masters I can get to help me pivot? Besides an MBA. I still wouldn’t mind being in the tech/engineering field.

1ee3faq,"Called out my supervisor on his BS, On a scale of 1 to 10, how f*cked am I?","So my PI has this annoying habit of unnecessarily creating interpersonal conflicts in the lab. After one month of back-breaking troubleshooting, I got my system working and finished my analysis yesterday. Now, when I had to give away the charge of the system to the next person who wanted to use it, he started doing this 'you know she doesn't want anyone else to use this machine' business. I found out about everything because, unbeknownst to him, labmates are pretty close and transparent. I was furious because that was not at all the case, but I kept my calm. Then he brought one more person into the problem and then, in a parallel, isolated conversation, started bad-mouthing that person to me and even asked me to call that person and put the call on loudspeaker. I mean, jesus fucking christ!, what is this? a reality TV show?

And, then, I lost it.

Gave him a nice earful and let him know that I was aware of his what he was up to. I was not rude, but it was pretty obvious that I was angry. The conversation ended in a diplomatic way (he even got that person into room  which did not work in his favour); he was a little snubbed because he got called out and proceeded to make a few saving-grace jokes about how it was his intention to facilitate communication rather than brew conflicts.

Now, how much fucked am I after this? Honestly, if there was no power play involved since he is my supervisor, I wouldn't be worried because I feel I did the right thing. I absolutely abhor bitching and gossiping. All in all, he is a pretty harmless person (more like a pathological gossiper), but still, should I extend an olive branch to him? Or should I pretend that it never happened and move on?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, y'all!

After reflecting on this thing and giving myself some space, let me explain things a little better...The thing is that at my heart, I believe that he is actually a good person. It is just that he has this gossiping habit. But he is a profound scientist and cares for his students (he just likes inducing mild drama into the lab), and I cannot help but respect him a lot for his scientific merit, which is why I actually feel guilty about going a little extreme by confronting him. These things have happened before ( he gossips about all labmates equally), but I was always able to keep a level head through all of them. But yesterday, I was so exhausted, had not slept properly in a month, had not showered in the last three days  (I was wearing the same underwear for the last two days because I did not get time to do laundry) and had a fever, too, that I just exploded. It's like you are used to working with some people because you admire the good qualities they have and also because you learn to ignore their bad ones. And yesterday, I could not ignore the bad one, which left me awkward and a little paranoid after the confrontation. I just think that on a better day, I could have minded my own way through this thing. In essence, I could have handled it in a better way: simply ignore and focus on the work. But I am more disappointed in myself rather than him. He behaved in the way he always has; it was my tolerance level that dropped. If this was one of my experiments, I would conclude my response as the dependent variable, my tolerance level/ state of mind as the actual independent variable and his gossip as the control variable only.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ee3faq/called_out_my_supervisor_on_his_bs_on_a_scale_of/
m0numg,"[Serious] I SOAPed, and You Can Too!","##PSA: DON'T ASK M4S IF THEY MATCHED

&nbsp;

Hello everyone. 

I know, I know, you have excellent board scores & letters of recommendations, you interview very well, or you’re applying to an “easy” specialty. But SOAP can happen to you (too)! I don't want to freak you out (I know I am), but the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) is something that a small percentage of medical students must go through every year. You need to know how it works. 43,000 medical students went through The Match last year. There were 1,700 unfilled spots for SOAPing. What happens if you are one of them? I went through the process last year & wanted to give some information & tips about going through the process. I am going to sprinkle in some of my experiences as we go on this journey. I’m not longer in the field I applied to & that’s okay.

&nbsp;

*—Note—*
>*The sentences that are different colors are links to relevant information. That may not always be obvious if you don’t have RES or are on mobile.*

&nbsp;

---
###SOAP, SOAP, WHAT IS SOAP!?

SOAP, or Supplemental Offer & Acceptance Program, is the opportunity (lol) to re-apply for unfilled residency positions the week of Match Week. The Match runs its algorithm & does quality control after submitting your Rank List officially. Once it figured out who is going where, there are both leftover applicants & residency spots. If you SOAP, you re-apply to available programs across remaining specialties & they offer you a spot in return. 

&nbsp;

---
###TO SOAP OR NOT TO SOAP

Before you start following through with SOAP, you REALLY need to think about your goals. Would you be happy doing internal/family medicine or general surgery the rest of your life? Should you apply but secretly plan to transfer for your PGY-2 year, either into the same specialty your originally attempted or a different specialty entirely? Should you take a research year & is that even feasible? Should you suck it up & accept whatever you get?

&nbsp;

I did not get a lot of information here & was woefully unprepared. Truly, I think I could've tried to do a research year & reapply, but my Dean pushed me hard to apply & take *whatever* I could get. A sneaking suspicion I have after the fact is that s/he didn't want to affect my medical school's Match rate. Regardless, this is a tough choice & the safest choice is likely to just apply & treat this as your last chance to Match. 

&nbsp;

Would you rather SOAP than match at some of the places you interviewed at? Fast rule: NOT WORTH IT. SOAPing is one of the worst experiences one can go through. If you applying to a large specialty with many SOAP spots, then maybe it is worth it. Check the link below to see what programs tend to be left for the SOAP before making this decision & then realize that you’ll be pitted against every applicant from your specialty who failed to match plus others jumping ship from their prior (this is specialty-dependent). Ask yourself this, would you rather not match this year or go to a program you don’t like? 

&nbsp;

LOOK AT YOUR SPECIALTY’S SOAP DATA NOW.  [I linked it right here (click this sentence)](https://bsolomon.us/app/residency-match/). Shout out to/u/anotherep for making this. It is otherwise VERY difficult to get useful information. 

&nbsp;

If you don’t match, will there only be no spots, 10 spots for hundreds of applicants, or plenty to go around?  NEXT look at your your back-up specialties. This will put this whole process in proper context.

&nbsp;

---
###THE BASICS

You have 45 applications you can use or void throughout SOAP. You have 4 days to use them. You need to apply & assign your application, letters of recommendations (LORs), board scores, etc. to these programs. Programs will contact you over the next 4 days for interviews. You may be offered a spot over **4** separate rounds (*increased from 3 for this year*), with fewer spots available as each round pass. If you do not match, the leftover spots are made available for you to apply to. 

&nbsp;

---
###PREPARE YOUR MIND

This is like waiting for interview invites on steroids. It will be grueling. Do not hold back anything. You will be delirious. You be sleep-deprived. You will cry. You will question decisions you made in the 4th grade. This will legitimately take time off your life. Just look at the Reddit SOAP threads from the last 3 years to see the chaos [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/), [2]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/), & [3]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/fjm0fo/official_soap_thread_2020/)

###*-SOAP DAY 1-* Monday, March 15th, 2021 (03/15/2021) ^^^I ^^^update ^^^these ^^^every ^^^year ^^^for ^^^you, ^^^my ^^^loved ^^^children

####10:30am ET: 
Your medical school learns whether you matched or not & begins game planning. 

&nbsp;

####11:00am ET: 
[""Did You Match?"" email is sent out](https://imgur.com/a/gRw72se). This tells you, well, whether you Matched or need to enter SOAP. It may take 5-10 minutes to get the email. I actually got mine 1 minute early. Refresh that sucker like your life depends on it, because it really kind of does... The crazy thing is, you do not have much time before you have to be finished shotgun applying to up to 45 programs by 3:00pm ET, so don’t dilly-dally!

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>I was table rounding in a psych ward when I got the email. I refreshed it over & over. It had to be a mistake. I waited as patiently as I could for my attending to stop discussing the patient (1-2 minutes) & told her I had to leave because I didn’t match. I tried to exit the ward, but it’s a psych ward, so I had to wait another minute for a slow nurse to come unlock the door. I applied psychiatry by the way, so the irony was not lost on me.

&nbsp;

The **List of Unfilled Programs** is available for you to look at. It is basically a list of the number of available residency spots at each unfilled residency in each specialty in alphabetical order. Print this out & trash the pages with specialties you aren’t re-applying for. This is a LONG document & it is easy to misplace pages you NEED. Highlight all the programs you are re-applying to. 

&nbsp;

There is not a lot of time between when you find out & can begin applying (1 hour). Programs won’t see applications for 4 hours, but they may see how quickly you applied relative to others, who knows. Get it done as soon as you can. Time goes fast from here on out.

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*My good friends met me in the medical school to help me out. Besides having to do the walk-of-shame, my room was next to the other medical students who volunteered to help us SOAPers. No one came to my aid from there group, but rather I had to listen to them pontificate on who didn’t match & why they thought so. Thanks, guys!*

&nbsp;

---
##TIPS:


1) Use **all** 45 applications now. 

* It may benefit you to save some, but it’s unlikely. You can continue to apply until after Round 2. Essentially you would have the luxury (?) of seeing which programs don’t fill & then apply to them, but I can’t really see how this would benefit you & think it would put you at an immediate disadvantage compared to those who applied earlier. 


2) Use your friends & volunteer classmates (lol) for the following: 

* Re-hashing your **personal statements** for major problems & tailoring it to your potential new specialties. Other eyes help give you a new perspective, but most importantly, save you time. 
* Looking up **residency locations**. You will not know what or where Madisonville, Kentucky is. Go to Google maps & look to see how close these programs are to major cities if that's what you want. You will be almost blindly choosing residencies, & the choices seldom be great.
* Bring you **carbs & electrolytes**. You need energy now more than ever. Your body has never known this level of fear before & will be working overboard. 


3) Use your Dean/Bigwig helps you for the following:

* Practice phone interviews & look for major flaws. Maybe you are on the spectrum & didn't realize. Maybe you came off as smug when you thought you were confident. I don't know. You don't know. Maybe none of the above. It'll help to have an honest, outside perspective, if not only to reassure you that you’re normal. 


4) Use your home PD for the following:

* Email/call them for feedback. I mean, I was pissed at my PD for not accepting me, but it's worth finding out if they have any useful feedback. My feedback was useless, but perhaps you'll be luckier.
 

5) Use your Letter of Recs (LORs), Dean/Bigwig, & PD for the following:

* Ask them to call/email on your behalf to open residency programs AFTER they’ve contacted you. You all are not allowed to contact programs without them first contacting you, but use your Dean's/Bigwig's judgment on this. Mine may have pulled some strings for me (didn’t matter though, lol).

6) Tell your close friends & get off social media. 

* I sent a generic text to my closest groups of friends, especially those who knew it was Match week, telling them I didn’t match & would be missing-in-action for the next couple of days. I updated my absolute closest friends & family nightly before bed. Dealer’s choice here.
* I did use these Reddit SOAP threads: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/), [2]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/), & [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/fjm0fo/official_soap_thread_2020/) because some good information was out there. It was an extremely supportive community with nonexistent/minimal trolling. If you troll SOAPers there is a special place in hell for you.

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I had to pull my PD's teeth to get him to provide any help, so it probably didn't help much. Fortunately, my LORs were more-than-willing to call on my behalf. The PD-to-be commented that my LOR advocated heavily for me & I think this helped programs know I was serious about my new specialty choice. That is not something that is easy to convince interviewers & I was even between those 2 specialties for years & chose almost on a whim in the end.*

&nbsp;

####12:00pm ET: 
You can begin submitting your documents & applying to unfilled residencies on ERAS. Be sure you have attached all of the documentation to each & every program. You have to redo it all. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I was late resubmitting my Step 2 scores because of this oversight. Scared the hell out of me. Don’t be me.*


####3:00pm ET: 
Unfilled residencies begin reviewing SOAP applications. 

&nbsp;

####From 3:00pm ET to 11:00pm ET: 
Do not expect calls early on, but it can happen. At earliest around dinner, if not tomorrow morning. Be dressed up from the waist up for potential Skype interviews. Be wary of **time zones**. I considered myself on the clock until about 10pm ET. Cry & talk to who you need to early in the day. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I was interrupted in the midst of crying to my significant other about how unfair life was when one of my top programs (albeit it was in family medicine) called me. Needless to say, it was a terrible interview & only made me feel worse the rest of the night. You don’t know how many calls you’ll get, so don’t allow yourself to blow it.*

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*My latest phone interview was the first night around 10:00pm or 11:00pm ET from a central time zone program, & I was the 2nd applicant they called! I was about to turn in when I got the call. Try to find a hobby you can do to take your mind off of things & keep you busy. I got really good at guitar again during SOAP.*

&nbsp;

##INTERVIEW INFORMATION:


1) These calls often happen without warning:

* Some programs email you via ERAS or have their program coordinator contact you to set up interviews. 
* I found that the majority were cold calls, at least until aPD &/or PD meetings were scheduled.


2) Residents screen you: 

* Lots of programs had 2 upper year residents call first before having me speak with the aPD &/or PD. Some feel like they’re recruiting you. 
* If they schedule interviews for a later time, try to take the soonest times you can. People remember the first & last things on lists.


&nbsp;

---
##INTERVIEW TIPS:

1) Lie. 

* Seriously, lie. If they ask whether you will transfer out after your first year, the answer is resoundingly NO. Find out reasons for them to believe you. Tell Madisonville, Kentucky you love incest if you must. 
* If they ask you whether you'll accept their offer (this happened to me), you say YES. You do NOT say no under any circumstance. YOU DO NOT SAY NO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. **YOU DO NOT SAY NO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.** 
* Honesty was my policy during interviews pre-SOAP & I was deceived by PDs. **They are rats. We are rats.** Play the game & Match. Nothing else matters.

2) Tell programs that you will 100% accept their offer

* Do not hesitate to say yes. In fact, emphatically say yes. 
* Programs will be wary, especially if you’re applying to a new specialty. I had programs basically straight up ask me how serious I was & whether I would accept their offer. I wrote a LOI to a program I had 0 desire to go to (my dean forced my hand, didn’t get the offer anyway). 
* You don’t have to write LOIs for every program. I only wrote it because the program was basically asking me to. I recommend post-interview communication with all interviewers though. 


3) Do NOT tell programs if other programs have promised you a spot.

* If a program says they are going to offer you a spot, first of all, do NOT believe them. It really doesn’t even make sense for them to do that if they weren’t, but it could prevent you from completing your interviews or subconsciously changing how you behave in other interviews. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*Some poor soul told some program coordinator, that s/he was already promised an offer so the residency didn’t need to interview with them anymore. This bitch then emailed the SOAP specialist asking whether it was allowed. Spoiler, it’s not, & she knew that!! [This applicant may have been slapped with a Match violation & lost his spot](https://imgur.com/a/iKLUA31). So…fuck you Brittany!*

&nbsp;

4) Research your top choices. 

* Your top choices are probably everyone’s top choices. Make sure you know them well. 
* Consider having your computer with you during phone interviews & do research mid-interview, but beware this can backfire as this is not easy to do. 


5) Dress up from the waist up. 

* Shower & wash your hair. Wear sweats underneath. You'll feel more human & will look better. RIP to your eyelid lower motor neurons this week.


6) Why didn’t you match? 

* You will get this question from serious programs. Have an answer, or at least brain-storm with them about reasons. Make something up if need be. Ask them why they didn’t match as well. 


7) Why did you apply here? 

* I found that the majority asked. Realistically, the answer is oftentimes LOCATION, which I think is an alright answer unless you were lucky enough to review 45 programs in detail. They know this, but they also will assume you weren't as serious if you don't have a good answer. 


8) What would you do in *x* situation? 

* I got more behavioral questions in one SOAP interview than my entire interview season. Not sure if it’s specialty-related (this was for family medicine) or SOAP-related. 


9) Do not rush interviews to answer incoming calls. 

* This sucks. Nothing you can do. Might not even happen. Do not try to rush your interview, even if you see it is from a city you are interested in. 1) The person calling may just have that area code. 2) You may not get that spot anyway, so don't burn bridges. Any missed call I had I was able to make up at a later time. 

&nbsp;

---
##POST-INTERVIEW COMMUNICATIONS:


1) Do it.

* Take no chances. Find all of their emails if you can. Ask the program coordinator if need be. I sent them to everyone with varying responses (mostly silence). Leave no stone unturned. You will be exhausted by this point, but you cannot stop pushing yourself to the finish line. 
* [Here are how many emails I sent out](https://imgur.com/a/4kBpFpI). Note how many have no replies. Note the interview survey request from pre-SOAP interviews that was requested of me. 


###*-SOAP DAY 2-* Tuesday, March 16th, 2021 (03/16/2021)

####6:00am ET: 
Get up & get dressed. Though it's unlikely you'll get a call very early, don't chance it. You won't be able to sleep anyway. 

&nbsp;

####11:30am ET: 
Programs can begin their rank list. I don't think this really means anything. 

&nbsp;

####11:30am to 11:00pm ET: 
Continue what you started the day before. Hopefully you have your aPD &/or PD calls today. [This day was very busy for me](https://imgur.com/a/HGFVSrV). May not be busy for you, & it doesn't necessarily mean anything. 

&nbsp;

###*-SOAP DAY 3: SOAP OFFER DAY 1 OF 2-* Wednesday, March 17th, 2021 (03/17/2021)

####12:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 1 starts. You receive any offers at this time. You must accept or decline your offers. You have 2 hours to respond. Once this is done, it is finalized. Don't click the wrong button.

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*Didn’t get any offers the 1st round. Was once again surprised & depressed. Went to grab lunch with friends who came to support me.*

&nbsp;

####2:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 1 ends. 

&nbsp;

####2:05pm ET: 
List of unfilled programs is updated. Time to find out who betrayed you. 

&nbsp;

####3:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 2 begins. Same as round 1. I think in 2019 this round *broke* & was skipped? 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*ACCEPTED!!!*

&nbsp;

####5:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 2 ends. 

&nbsp;

####5:05pm ET: 
List of unfilled programs is updated. Time to find out who else betrayed you. 

&nbsp;

###*-SOAP DAY 4: SOAP OFFER DAY 2 OF 2-* Thursday, March 18th, 2021 (03/18/2020)

####9:00am ET: 
SOAP offer round 3 starts. Same as above. If you got nothing, wait until 12:00pm ET & find out what's left. 

&nbsp;

####12:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 4 starts. Same as above. If you got nothing, wait until 3:00pm ET & find out what's left. 

&nbsp;

####2:00pm ET: 
SOAP ends. It's over. 

&nbsp;

####3:00pm ET: 
Post-SOAP List of Unfilled Programs updated to include all remaining unfilled programs (including those not participating in SOAP) & available to all unmatched & partially matched applicants regardless of SOAP eligibility. Hopefully this isn't you. Apparently it costs a boatload to apply from here on out. You can call programs directly & try to schedule interviews. Not an easy path. We had someone successfully do this after a couple of months at my medical school. I can’t offer any advice in this regard. You can check out [this recent (now old) post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aryuez/serious_so_you_didnt_matchnow_what/) by [USER] for advice. 

&nbsp;

###*-Match Day-* Friday, March 19th, 2021 (03/19/2021)

####1:00pm ET: 
Feign surprise. Unfortunately everyone knows. But you accomplished something they will never understand. No one else will understand what you just went through. This was one of the worst weeks of my life, but I came out. You can too. COVID update—you’ll also probably be doing this over Zoom…which is maybe worse than before. 

---
&nbsp;

I’ll try to answer any questions you all have. I don’t want to give away who I am that easily, so it may have to be through PMs. These SOAP threads [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/), [2]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/), & [3]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/fjm0fo/official_soap_thread_2020/) were very helpful for me because everyone was supporting each other. Keep that trend going. Lie to **programs**, not to other applicants.

1154vse,"academically dismissed, do I say goodbye to college?","Hey yall, as the title says, I got dismissed.

I feel like I can finally admit to myself that I worked myself too hard. After Spring 2022, I felt pressured to follow my friend group and take summer courses. It ended up burning me out super bad and several external factors only made it way, WAY worse, resulting in a major depression diagnosis. Fall 2022, I failed. Got 2 E's on the transcript.

But one thing I was beating myself up over was my study methods. To give background I have ADHD and my major is my weakness, im a physics/engineering major. But I couldn't EVER get an effective study session in. I did the Pomodoro method and a couple other methods I cant remember. But I could never sit down, read the chapters, do the homework and STUDY. Even if I did, I'd be mentally exhausted after working out one problem and I'd pass out. 

I mean, looking back now, I realize that my approach was horrific to say the least. I want to give it another go but my financial aid is messed up as financial aid wise, im a junior but creditwise a sophomore.

I'm looking into taking a step back and going to a community college and shoot for actual engineering, not  a major that acts as a work around. (I picked physics because it gave me access to engineering, eventually) 

I apologize for airing the laundry, but I suppose I should ask, have you found yourself in a situation where your study method wasn't effective?

Y'all I know I'm good enough, I know I'm awesome, but compared to the rest of you???!!! I am very average on paper. I am just SO EXHAUSTED at having to convince others that ""I'm promise I'm awesome!!!""

1hvq7mp,So much context-switching,"I've taught three semesters as a professor now. My life seems to consist more of context-switching than actual work.

I'm trying to do research. This requires focus. To give a lecture for a class, though, I need to first immerse my mind in that topic. After the lecture, my mind is still buzzing with that topic, with what to talk about next lecture, with ideas for homework, etc. I go through a period of a few hours of trying to turn that off and switch to the next thing I need to deal with, like figuring out how to get something to work in Canvas or finding out how to transfer credit for an advisee or immersing my mind in the topic for tomorrow morning's lecture in a different class. Oh, wait, I was trying to do research. What was I working on, again? Oh, damn, now I need to design an exam.

My first year, I did 25 hours of service—requiring more context-switching. I just learned that I was supposed to do 45 hours. 45 hours in one week would be no problem, but 45 hours spread throughout the school year adds about 60 context-switches.

I completed zero research in my first three semesters. Seldom have I worked on the same thing two days in a row. Restarting something a couple days after dropping it is slow and painful. At home, I've been too exhausted after the day's context-switching and usually done nothing at all, hoping to clear my mind.

All this context-switching seems…inefficient. I find it unpleasant and unproductive.

1iamjvt,Battling addiction during my PhD,"I'm a fifth-year PhD student in a STEM field at a prestigious institution in the USA. I started my PhD journey in the Fall of the doomed year 2020, just after defending and graduating from my Masters that July. My masters advisor was basically the abusive-boyfriend types: 

insulting followed by complimenting to disorient the student, using our own ideas as his and then turning it around on us when they didn't work out, not paying attention to our small errors in the beginning and then blowing things out of proportion, (in my case) not taking care of his groups finances and blaming me for using an instrument that he knew I was testing stuff on. 

He's not in academia anymore coz most of his graduate students left his group and he was denied tenure. 

Shortly afterwards, I started my PhD in a field that I had no experience in whatsoever since I chose the mentor I wanted to work with and not the project, since I figured I had 5 years to gain mastery over a new area of expertise. One year into my PhD, I got diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety (linked to my childhood sexual abuse, extreme pressure from my family, and general mental abuse throughout my life including the recently concluded Masters). In 2022, right after my proposal, I discovered marijuana and it all went downhill from there. I bought pre-rolls, vapes, gummies and lost 2½ years of my life (both my personal and PhD life). I'm sober after a long battle with addiction (please don't believe folks who convince you of the goodness of marijuana without also talking about the possibilities of getting addicted) and now getting back to my productive-ish self. 

I'm very proud of myself, but can't stop my grief over my lost time, lost reputation, lost motivation and lost honor. I don't know how long these regrets are going to eat me up, but this is even more dangerous since I'm scared I might seek the support of substances again in a moment of weakness. After a terrible meeting with my advisor where my ideas and data were pooh-poohed, and seeing my cohort-mate in the lab write NIH grants, I couldn't help but wonder if there's no way I can gain back my academic motivation! I could've done so much, and now I'm just a shadow of the researcher I used to be. Still sober, still strong, but I'd be lying if I said I'm not exhausted at the mere thought of battling the uncertainties of science and research.

1mr81qg,"2024 Grad, 1 Year Gap, 0 Offers  where Do I Even Go From Here?","I completed my master’s around August 2024, so it’s been almost a year now. 2023 and 2024 were just… I don’t know man. I got into a good college recession was there no luck. I gave a lot of interviews. Reached 7th and 8th rounds in some companies....not even Google, but still 7 rounds and still got rejected. Some of the reasons were the stupidest possible. 

I’m not here to complain, but honestly......... I am just tired.

Ghosting is on another level. It is like they can’t even send a basic rejection mail. 

I gave 5 on-site interviews ...followed up and got “we’ll let you know,” and then silence forever. So frustrating.

Right now, Idek what to do. Everyone says the same thing -- keep grinding, getting a job takes time, keep learning, keep moving forward, apply to startups, work for low pay if you have to. I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad? No clue.

My domain is also ridiculously saturated. I know Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices, but companies only want people with 4+ or 5+ years of experience. People keep telling me ----- 

“Do AI, it’s the buzzword right now.” I get it, and I’m not against it, but should I throw away my whole domain just because it’s trendy? I feel like I should incorporate AI into what I already know, not just switch blindly.



But honestly... it’s become repetitive and monotonous. Everywhere online it looks like everybody is getting jobs, building startups, tracking Y Combinator, whatever. I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.

And here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. 

I’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. 

Freshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. 

Jobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.



I’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.

And I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.

If someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.

I never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.

So… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?

And how's everything going for my fellow recent grads ....how's it for yall?",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mr81qg/2024_grad_1_year_gap_0_offers_where_do_i_even_go/
1ee16ah,Tell me to not be too nice,"I'm teaching a full load at summer school, again. And every damn time, I face this, but it seems worse this year.  I've had more than the usual number of students come to me after the final project is due and after the term ends this week to request more time to turn in their finals (literally, these are no-wrong-answer types of finals to help make it more difficult to use AI, but not difficult for the student to do). I gave them weeks to complete this as well. Their excuses are family vacations, getting a fever, working, etc. I already have a policy in place that I do not accept late work, but it's the end of term and I'm exhausted. I have three choices: 1. Stick by my syllabus and say nope, no can do. Sorry; 2. Accept the projects and take off a solid chunk of points off the top; 3. Let them turn it in and just hate myself for being a pushover. Go ahead and shake some sense into me. I'm too tired to think right now.

1mi28q0,Nurse who wants to go to grad school but for what?,"I am a registered nurse but I miss school. I love writing and research, always have. I want to go to grad school, I have a BA in psychology and a BSN (nursing). I am 29 years old.

I am still paying off debt, nursing pays well and I am only two years in (89k a year, not including OT) but I am exhausted. I could go into travel nursing and make more but I miss academia. 

I considered getting a masters in counseling, nursing (NP or nursing professor) or even English (I just want to read and write).

I took the practical route post secondary and I always have nursing to fall back on. I’m simply not satisfied. 

I long for intellectual conversation, as contrived and conceived as that may be. My job is task-driven, highly emotional, and although it requires a substantial amount of critical thinking, it’s not the mental engagement I’m looking for. In fact, it’s mentally draining and demoralizing, as I feel stretched thin and treated like a servant, and expected to be doing a multitude of mundane tasks, and be in multiple places at once.

1h88dkz,How do you deal with students who want to negotiate grades?,"I've been teaching for over 10 years and in the last few years I've seen a massive increase in students who want to argue over exam grades. It's gotten to the point that as soon as I return exams, at the end of class, I have at least 20 students lined up wanting to argue for a grade change (out of a class of 180). I teach STEM so my exams are mathematics-based. It is not subjective. We give partial credit throughout, 100 points are divided into 1-5 points per aspect in a problem and we do not carry forward cascading errors. There is a rubric we grade to and I do not provide the solutions because students have uploaded them to Chegg. Exam grades are high on average due to the structure and grading format (in the B+ range).

It gets super uncomfortable on exam return days. I tell the students why their answers are incorrect in a public space which is uncomfortable. They argue for more points without having taken the time to review what they did wrong. They don't take no for an answer until I repeat myself 3 times. They leave frustrated. This repeats for every student in the line until I am emotionally exhausted, and a bit angry, and it shows on my face. Last semester, this was reflected in my evaluations. ""condescending"", ""fake nice"", etc.

This semester, I told the students as they lined up that going over their exams instantly (like some sort of grading robot who stores the solutions and grading rubric in my mental RAM) and in public was uncomfortable for me. I asked them to take a picture of the problem in-question, return the physical to me, and email me their questions. It has made things better but now my inbox is full.

How do you all deal with grade grubbing? Do you allow it? I am considering making a rule that grades are non-negotiable and just saying no moving forward.

1bmbadp,My PI picks up undergrads like strays,"I’m a 4th year chem PhD candidate. There are three other grad students in my lab: one 5th year, one 2nd year, and one 1st year. We now have SIX undergrads.

There are no more desks in the office. We have six undergrads split between four grad students, except it’s really between three of us because the 2nd year is not capable of mentoring an undergrad. When you factor in all of the lab upkeep jobs, teaching responsibilities, classes, meetings, writing, actually doing our own research…I’m fucking exhausted.

And we’re getting visiting scholars and rotating 1st years over the summer. No idea where they’re gonna sit.

I’ve had countless conversations about my PI about how the amount of undergrads he takes puts insane amounts of pressure on us and prevents us from making progress on our research. And he’ll say he understands, then the next day be yelling at me for not getting an experiment completed because I was too busy making sure my undergrad didn’t accidentally kill himself in lab. And when I say yelling, I mean YELLING.

1mkaph7,85% of writing done,"68k words of around 80k completed. Humanities thesis in Australia.

State of play
- Have submitted 4 of 6 substantive chapters (2x analytical chapters, methodology, and periodisation chapters) to supervisors. Only minor revisions suggested to each.
- Only probably 2-3k words left each in the last analytical chapter and theoretical framework chapters.
- Then have to write intro and conclusion.
- Also need to format all of my references which is going to be a right nightmare as I just dumped in links to articles or books, or random notes (referencing as I go breaks up my writing workflow).

Hoping to submit in December and just lodged my intent to submit notice with my university which was approved by my lead supervisor and the associate dean who also granted me permission to exceed the word count by 5k words if needed. 

Really utterly exhausted after 4.5 years in the program (I took in there a one year leave of absence). So ready to be done. So terrified I somehow won’t be done by Dec - even though I have 5 months left I have a full time job now as my funding ran its course so only work on my thesis on weekends. 

Basically… just need to hear some encouraging words at this point! I kept telling myself throughout the last gruelling year of writing that I’ve done all the work (coursework, ethics application, fieldwork, etc) and now I just have to write about it. The thesis is just a cherry on top, and I can’t not pass at this stage. But fear is starting to creep in that I’m going to fail after all of this or that I might not get it done.

1f5pk04,College as a physically weaker student ,"I think that one aspect of college that can be overlooked is the amount of physical lifting you have to do. I'm a pretty unfit person, and 10 pounds underweight (yeah that's really terrible and definitely a huge factor in this but I'm working on it) and just a naturally weak person. My campus is large, and this semester, my classes are 20 minutes of walking from my dorm. I have to carry my laptop and tablet and some water. It doesn't sound like much but god it absolutely kills my body, especially my back. And when I get physically/ emotionally exhausted, I find little energy left for schoolwork.

So I just bought a new backpack from swiss gear that will hopefully give me more back support, unlike my backpack I had before for my first year that was more for aesthetic purposes. I'm deciding to not carry a large flask for water, but maybe a simpler water bottle. I'm trying to force myself to eat more meals even though eating hurts me sometimes and feels like a chore (another problem I definitely need to sort out). It doesn't help that the only good diner on my campus is a 20+ minute walk away from my dorm, and the diners near mine are either very limited in food choice, lesser to my liking, and/or busy as hell. I do have some food in my dorm and got protein shakes, which will hopefully improve my weight.

I wonder if I should start exercising, although I feel like all the walking and backpack lifting I do is exercise in itself. 

Anyone else have any similar issues? What do you guys do to manage carrying items and long walks on campus?

edit: Obviously, for now, before I ever go to the gym- I HAVE to work on gaining weight lol, if I went to the gym right now with my weight and diet I’d probably accidentally die or something tbh

1k8udoi,End of the semester: How much empathy can one give?,"Although this is my 4th semester, I am still new to all this. Over the past couple years, my class size has increased. This semester I have about 165 students in my largest class. One thing that I have learned is that students love to wait til the end of the semester to share life’s circumstances. I understand trying to push through it, but I have asked them to let me know when things happen instead waiting til the end.

Their semester paper was posted in the syllabus with the due date. I told them over a month ago that they should be working on it. This is a huge assignment and requires me and my teaching assistants to devote a lot of time to it on top of catching up on grading other things. The long emails about “can we meet to discuss this?” From folks with multiple missing assignments or no assignments turned in at all are rolling in and I am already exhausted. 

One student even accused me of something that I didn’t do in order to get an extension. Of course I defended myself but I just gave in for the extension. 

Oh I was not feeling well the day it was due. Oh I was out of town the day it was due. Sigh. 

Like most of us, I have in my syllabus that doctors notes are a valid excuse. But the, “I have been sick all semester”, or “My grandpa has been sick since January and it’s taken a toll on me all semester” or “I have been sick several times this semester, here’s my collection of doctors notes now allow me to make up everything even though grades are due next week”. All of these things are very valid BUT why didn’t you tell me this early on? The big issue for me is timing. I’m grateful for the students who send me an email several days before the assignment is due to tell me it’s a bad mental health week, I need more time. Sure! No problem. 

How do I handle this with care and boundaries for myself? How do YOU handle this time of the semester when the excuses start rolling in? I don’t care about being “liked” but I do want to be careful and considerate. The longer I’m in this profession the harder it’s getting to brave this time of the semester 😩",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1k8udoi/end_of_the_semester_how_much_empathy_can_one_give/
1avoog2,I’m leaving academia. Should I master out of my PhD?,"I entered a PhD program in biology straight out of undergrad. I’m now six years into the program and can graduate within the next semester, but a few things have happened simultaneously. 

First, I’ve realized I want to leave academia; most likely forever, but at the very least the next few years. 

Second, I’ve decided I need to prioritize work-life balance far above pay, and was just offered a nice job conducive to this. 

Lastly, my funding has run out and I need to pay $3k out of pocket for my final semester.

Part of me (plus my adviser and department chair) is saying that a PhD for $3k is not a bad deal; and there’s a good chance it’ll pay for itself in the long run. I’ve done the work so it makes sense to get the credit. I’d also really hate to tell all the people that knew I was going for a PhD that I didn’t finish.

The other part of me is saying that a master’s is more conducive to my career goals anyway. My money, and the effort it takes to finish, could be better spent. At best devoting resources to a PhD now is a vanity project. At worst, it leaves me over-qualified for the low-responsibility positions I’m interested in and maybe locks me out of academia if I choose to return in the future (unlikely as that is).

Any advice or perspective at all would be so truly appreciated. I’m so exhausted being at the end of my degree and this is such a tough decision.

kbwwqh,[residency] thoughts from a ranking meeting,"Didn't interview but I sat in a gen surg rank meeting for the first time and it's interesting being on the other side. Random thoughts:

* we give our applicants a composite numerical ranking/grade and then discuss them to move them up or down, and most applicants ended up scoring within a few points of each other (e.g. the top applicant had 98 points, the next had 97, several people had 96, etc.) which was a lot closer than I would've thought
* ranking meeting was over 3 hours long - by the time we got to the lower-ranked applicants we were all exhausted and there was less genuine interest and more just taciturn agreement
* couples matching actually gave an edge
* being a lifer at an institution and applying to somewhere else was actually a detriment, UNLESS you somehow were able to say why you were interested in leaving that area
* being normal/average was not a bad thing but didn't get you noticed; if you can connect with somebody during your social or your interviewers, you're much more likely to get bumped up - the interviewers (and us residents) really did vouch for people and battle it out during the rank meeting
* some of the highest scoring people (250+) were at the bottom of our list for various reasons, so it won't save you if you interviewed poorly
* apparently there is such a thing as ""too rehearsed"" which I found strange - why would being prepared be seen as a detrimental quality?? what subjective bullshit is this
* there ARE some things that should NOT be said in response to an interview question - I was fascinated by how some people made it this far and still had some wacky responses, so if you're at all concerned just run your responses by a trusted friend or mentor
* this is still a formal process - do not call your interviewers or residents ""pal"" or ""dude"" lol come on
* extroverts really did seem to have an edge, as the calmer/introverted interviewees came across as uninterested and stiff (probably unfairly so)
* go to the video socials and say something and/or ask a question, because someone WILL notice that you just silently stared at a camera for 45 min and bring it up at the rank meeting (which is interesting because I didn't realize some attendings paid attention that closely because I sure as fuck didn't); see above bullet point
* this process is a crap shoot and luck really does play into this - some interviewers naturally love everyone and some interviewers were determined to find fault with anything and everything
* wtf is this process

EDIT: I think I caused a lot of anxiety with my post... sorry dudes. I just wanted to give a little more transparency to what goes on during this stuff. Also wanted to clarify the point on talking during the social - my personal experience is that each breakout Zoom room had 4-6 interviewees, so if everyone but you has talked or commented or something, then it probably stands out. I didn't realize some programs had like 40+ people in one room lol so obviously my point doesn't apply there. Please keep in mind it's just one lowly PGY2's thoughts on the process at one specific program in one specific field. Good luck everyone!

1g2p2rt,The People's Commissariat for Higher Education,"I'm a prof at a major British university you'll all have heard of. Been working here a long, long time. I used to love my job but in the last few years, especially since the pandemic, I am growing to hate my job because we are rapidly turning into a parody of a Soviet Ministry. I know this is becoming more common in the UK. Does this sound familiar to others around the world?

I don't mean the hiring of ""revolutionary comrades"" who consider research, teaching, supervision, pastoral care, and admin to be an inconvenient obstacle to their real goal of pretending they're storming the Czar's palace (don't get me started on the cosplay commies). I mean the rapid transition from an institution dedicated to teaching, to an institution dedicated to mindless, utterly pointless, administration. An incomprehensibly vast bureaucracy led by totally incompetent yes-men whose only job is to maintain their jobs by embedding themselves even deeper in bureaucracy to the extent they can't be removed without the whole system unravelling. An institution defined by administrators administrating administrators - for no purpose.

First is the ballooning number of administrative personnel. Administrators now outnumber teachers/researchers by THREE to one. The result is a massive increase in admin departments, admin managers, admin committees, and admin processes. All of these administrators (especially managers) need to justify their existence, so processes have become nightmarish. Earlier this year I requested a new computer monitor. In 2018 I needed one so I went two doors down to the office, asked for one, and was given one. In 2024 I had to complete three forms that needed to be countersigned by two managers and approved by SIX administrative divisions (which took 5 weeks), so that someone two doors down could unlock the cupboard and give me a monitor. EXACTLY the same outcome, but with a massive amount of unnecessary administration. Similarly, hiring internal Teaching Assistants has gone from being done by one prof per dept to TWENTY-TWO administrative divisions and committees being involved, meaning a process that used to take a week now lasts year-round. Bureaucracy for the sheer sake of bureaucracy.

Second is the huge number of ""executives"", the overwhelming majority of whom have no identifiable purpose, and many od whom appear to just be hired into newly-created jobs by their mates. So to justify their bloated nepotistic salaries, they create webs of even more administration that is even more inefficient and has even less purpose, to demonstrate how vital they are to the institution. 

Third is the cronyism and corruption of executive promotions. Not new, I know, but much more naked now. And seems to take place primarily among the administrative/executive personnel, not teaching/research. People who are manifestly incompetent, incapable of doing their jobs, and/or highly unpleasant people whose management style fills their teams with despair, are promoted upwards so they're someone else's problem. So we end up with a leadership team of gerontocratic cronies, failed middle-managers, and toxic people nobody can stand to work with. Most of whom cling onto their positions by creating more committees, more regulations, more processes and impose them on us, just to justify their existence. They create little empires and because all that matters is their huge salary and sense of self-importance from having a meaningless title and a personal assistant, they cling on to their empire even when it is actively making things worse.

Fourth is the increasing surveillance of students just ao we can collate vast reams of pointless data and endless, useless, statistics - for the pointless committees and executives to pore over. Teaching staff are now required to continually monitor each and every student's somatic and social characteristics and collate laborious, time-consuming statistics so that managers can summon committees and write reports saying that some particular module is not doing enough for students with Protected  Characteristic X (and I'm not whining about that, I am from more than one minority and students have real pressures). The problem isn't the students or professors, it's the admin divisions. Nothing actually gets done to help students with Protected Characteristic X, because if the problem is solved then that admin division no longer has a reason to exist. So nothing gets done, and we're just compiling data for no reason. If it was important, then surely the vast, bloated bureaucracy could collate it rather than exhausted frontline teachers. We are drowning in administrative tasks that have no purpose.

Fifth is the laughably inefficient processes and archaic technologies we use. To compile these endless reams of pointless statistics and vast reports that nobody reads, we are using ancient technology. There is zero automation. Every single administrative process is conducted either through meetings, or through emails. So Monday-Friday's timetable is completely colonised by useless meetings so that a pointless executive can feel important, while evenings, weekends, and any spare hour of the work day has to be dedicated to desperately trying to process the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of emails that come flooding in. The phone systems don't work (because nobody seems entirely sure who's in charge, and getting your voicemail ID login requires multiple admin divisions) so we get emails demanding answers to voicemails we can't access; emails sent to the wrong person and then we have to search through emails to find out who is doing UG Admisisons this year, for example; emails from students asking why we haven't answered their Sunday morning email asking for an immediate one on one meeting to discuss their grade; emails tersely reminding us to complete the mandatory-every-year three-hour video training on bloody workplace health and safety (and the 10-15 other smug, supercilious, excessively long training videos apparently aimed at six-year-olds, which we have to endure)....  drowning in useless admin, because we have failed to move beyond the 1980s. 

Sixth (and I hope this is unique to my institution) is the self-appointed political secret police. Wannabe commissars who do the bare minimum (or much less) in teaching, research, admin, and student support, and instead believe they are being paid to launch a global revolution. They surveil their colleagues for signs of political heresy. They actively sabotage admin tasks and committees (and even their own marking) so they are not assigned such tasks again - so their admin tasks are dumped onto good colleagues who are already drowning. They weasel their way into positions of petty power so that colleagues they suspect of heresy get probations extended, contracts not renewed, good candidates are passed over for vacancies while these peoples' mates get hired because they've been told in advance exactly what to say. The only reason they haven't taken over is that they spend so much time infighting and excommunicating each other for thoughtcrime, they remain at a level where they can't gain real power, but they can **** everything up for everyone else.

So there we have it. Post-Covid academia and the transition from places of learning fit for the twenty-first century, to crumbling, pointless, Kafkaesque Soviet ministries circa 1989, where utterly exhausted and deeply demoralised staff are caught up in an unending cycle of pointless bureaucracy, pointless statistics, pointless jobs, constantly dictated to by useless higher-ups who produce nothing but decrees and spied on by people who can't hide their lust for petty power, then go drown their sorrows with their fellow dejected drones before starting another pointless day of pointless tasks.

I have issues with a lot of aspects of my life and everyday the pain just keeps growing. I am disappointed in myself, disgusted at my behavior and just wanna it to end.( It's an alt account because I don't want people to find me. )

I immigrated from my home country when I was 7 years with my family and since the permanent residency in the US takes so long, I am still considered an international student and that means it will be significantly harder to find internships, and jobs. Just thinking about internships and jobs makes me so stressed out.

I am not doing good in my classes either, CS has just been rigorous for me. I am just sliding by with a 2.9 gpa. I got a 40 on my discrete math 2 exam and I keep fucking shit up. I don't skip class. It's just really hard to focus for me, I get easily fucking distracted and I am embarrassed because everyone else is so much better than me. Everyone around me juggles so much stuff and they still end up with better grades and a better life. I feel so empty. I keep making so many stupid mistakes and at the end I cry over them. These days, I cry at least once a day. To save money on rent I commute from home and my total daily commute is over 2 hours and I just get exhausted before I get to class and it's just year 2. I got 2 more years with even harder classes and just thinking about that gets me stressed and dizzy.

I know my problems. I know exactly what is causing my issues but every time I try to change, I do for a couple days but then go back to normal. The years of doom scrolling and TikTok during COVID-19 ruined my fucking brain and it just makes my life 10 times worse. I hate myself for it. I have a passion for cs and I love to make my own projects but these social media just got me addicted like a drug and I keep just eating valuable time away by just scrolling.

1j0o8t2,Do I hate college or do I hate my major?,"Context: When I was in high school, I LOVED school. I loved learning, I loved doing hard things, and I performed pretty well. Of course, I had subjects I struggled in, but it always seemed to work out and I graduated in the top 5% of my class. I balanced a lot of extracurriculars, had a job, had hundreds of volunteer hours, and didn’t have much issue with multitasking (at least compared to now). I eventually got accepted to my current college’s honors program on a full ride.

When I went to college, I majored in Civil Engineering—despite the fact that I feel more confident in the humanities/social sciences. But I’m not too deterred by not knowing something. Personally, I believe that the whole point of college is to challenge yourself to learn new things. I’ve learned a lot more in STEM subjects that I had no idea about a year ago. 

I’m currently in my sophomore year and I’m SERIOUSLY struggling. I have friends who call themselves dumb, but have so much more of an idea as to what’s going on in class. They’ll get Bs on exams and I’ll get Ds. I attend so many office hours, study until extremely late, meet with my TAs, try to learn from friends, and my grades are still shit. I often dread going to classes because I never understand what’s going on, and I always feel so exhausted. My GPA has never been so low, and I feel so, so stupid. In high school, I never was “naturally smart”—if anything, I think I’m very slow to learn. I need to work three times as much to understand concepts, especially math-science related ones. 

I now don’t know what to do. My grades are plummeting, the advice I’ve received from professors has been like, “Study harder,” and I’ve never felt so bad about school before. I’m not even sure what I want to do with this degree, and I only really chose it because of its flexibility, demand, and high paying rate. 

I would be lying if I said I wasn’t pursuing a STEM degree mainly for financial reasons. I grew up low-income, and am worried that I’ll have worked so hard just to not make enough. I only have so many years left before I graduate… and I really need help.

1mp9571,AI philosophical question I'm debating as I prepare this semester's syllabi.,"Should I stop fighting the AI tidal wave and just 1) grade what I get or use the ""if you use AI I use AI to grade"" strategy and 2) grow the popularity of my courses? Surely due to AI I already have a fraction of the Ds and Fs I used to. 

  
Here's some background: with rounds and rounds of budget cuts I \*need\* to have popular classes. I need butts in seats and a lot of non-majors take my classes--meaning they don't need my classes for their majors and it provides critical revenue for my department. I have been reading everything I can to AI-proof my classes. But I also feel like it's pointless. Every good idea (in-class assignments) cause scheduling problems or require me to come to campus more or require more time grading (oral exams or videos). I'm exhausted and sad. 

Is it so bad for me to just yield? The students who want to practice skills will--and some of them actually share this when we talk about AI as a class. The benefit if I just look the other way is that my life is easier and my class will have higher grades and more students enroll. Maybe I just focus on the 1% of students who care??

Some context: I am going through some pretty extreme stress with a sick/elderly parent, a trial I have to testify for approaching, some issues that happened with a specific student and caused some administrative drama, on top of an already busy and demanding schedule. Today I also had a specialty health appointment that I had been waiting 6 months for and ended in disappointing / upsetting news. I teach 2 classes for adult learners on Thursdays, both online, once in the afternoon and once in the evening.

  
By my evening class, I was exhausted but working through it, teaching material that I know very well and have been over many times. But then suddenly I noticed myself becoming less and less coherent and then my brain seemed to freeze for a full minute. This was an online class and I *stopped talking for a full minute*. I could see the students looking confused / worried which increased my panic. Eventually I composed myself, apologized and went on. I seemed to get a second wind after that and the rest of the class went on fine aside from the fact that I was embarrassed and apologized / made excuses several more times before class was up.

  
This is probably the third time I have been super exhausted during this class and it's beyond embarrassing to make the excuse of, ""I'm sorry class, I'm so tired"" for a *scheduled* evening class. I feel like the students are seeing the worst of me and I don't want them to leave with the impression that I am a bad teacher, unprofessional, etc. If I was a student seeing this class, I would have thought ""wow this person is drunk or there is something wrong with them"".

1mpd9g1,I AM HEARTBROKEN AND LOST PLEASE HELP,"I’m a graduate student in a PhD program and feel completely stuck and emotionally exhausted. I’ve been in my current lab for almost a year, and while my advisor has been understanding about time off for health and personal matters, the lab culture has become toxic and unbearable. Two senior members a postdoc and a more advanced student make my work life miserable. The postdoc, who trains me, cycles between being cordial and verbally abusive, snapping and yelling over small mistakes. I’ve tried to keep the peace by being respectful, offering help, and even small gestures of kindness, but it always returns to hostility. The senior student avoids teaching me when asked, expects me to do him favors, and when I once forgot a minor task, publicly called me out in front of others. Recently, a shared instrument broke; without checking the logs, the postdoc instantly blamed me, only for it to later be proven that it wasn’t my fault yet there was no apology. I also have a health issue that causes noise sensitivity, and this machine triggers my symptoms, making the work even more stressful. My commute is three hours , and my physical and mental health have been deteriorating to the point where I’ve fainted twice recently. When I try to raise these issues with my advisor, he interrupts me and shifts the conversation to feedback about me saying that if it weren’t for my health condition, he would have questioned whether I should be in graduate school at all, and that I’m simply “not doing enough.” Recently, he gave my role to an undergraduate student. It hurt to hear that my best still isn’t enough, and to be replaced so easily. It’s made me feel like I’m walking on eggshells and has shaken my confidence in my abilities. I’ve asked to change projects, but my advisor says I’d lose my funding if I did. He’s now looking for someone to take over my role permanently, and if no new project opens up, my only options are to finish with a master’s or find a new advisor. If I accept the master’s “downgrade” option, my tuition would still be covered, but it would mean ending my PhD here. I’ve also been accepted into another PhD program with a brand-new PI and exciting research, but with slightly lower funding and the risk of the unknown. I’m torn between staying in a toxic but established environment, taking the safer and more peaceful route with unknowns that is closer to my home, or stepping back to complete a master’s and regroup later.

I just got an internship offer (Financial Institution) in app dev (yay), and I’m also graduating in the same semester. I’ll be working the internship during the week, doing part-time work on the weekends cause I'm broke, and taking one night class. So basically working 6/7 days. I've worked part-time in a dead end job ever since I entered college.

On top of that, I’m getting married VERY soon and DIY’ing most of the decorations with my partner.

I work on productive hobbies on the side, meet with friends once a month and watch shows & go on dates with my fiancé to keep her happy although it stresses the hell outta me.

Should I start leetcoding on the side or continue trying to build cloud projects to boost my resume? Or should I enjoy my nights after grinding non-stop for years? REALISTICALLY, can I finally go ""No Life Mode"" & play all the games that I missed the past 7 years? Maybe even break my 4-6 hours of sleep habit?

I got PTSD by a couple of past employers that promised positions but haven't come through. With current market, I'm always stressed thinking I'm falling behind while friends I grew up with are now team leads and managers.

1lg8i7t,Quitting Japanese PhD with a co–first author Nature paper — chances at top-tier US/UK PhD programs?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a neuroscience PhD student at a university in Japan. I’ve been in my current lab for 6 years (including undergrad research), and I’m now 4 years into the PhD program. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering quitting and reapplying to PhD programs in the US or UK due to ongoing issues with my advisor and lab environment.

To be blunt, I’m exhausted. My advisor requires me to write every detail of his conference presentations — slides, scripts, everything — and he barely engages until he reviews and nitpicks it a week later. I’ve also been made to fact-check and review drafts of his popular science books, and take calls during evenings and weekends with no boundaries. While I’ve managed to endure this so far, the final straw is this: our lab typically has a publication cycle of 3–4 years, and although I have a co–first-author paper currently in revision at Nature, he’s insisting I publish an additional paper before I can graduate. That’s not realistic for me, and it’s led me to think seriously about starting over elsewhere once the paper is published.

I'm now considering applying to neuroscience PhD programs in the US or UK. (Most EU programs are not an option since I don’t have a master’s degree.)

My main concerns:

My undergraduate GPA is 3.33/4.00 — not terrible, but not particularly competitive.

Given my advisor’s strong opposition to me leaving (he tends to treat students as if he ""owns"" them — even trying to control our postdoc destinations, and has frequently threatened to withhold graduation if we don't comply with his demands), I likely won’t be able to get a letter of recommendation from him or other faculty I’ve worked closely with during my PhD, as he tends to exert pressure on colleagues to prevent them from supporting students who go against his wishes.

I’m currently considering:

A professor from an undergrad course I took 4 years ago, but i had quite good relationship with him. But I haven't contacted with him since.

A professor I briefly collaborated with on a joint project

Possibly a postdoc who graduated from my current lab



I know LORs carry a lot of weight in applications, and I’m still struggling to figure out who I can reasonably ask for a letter.

Given this situation, do I have a realistic shot at being admitted to a top-tier PhD program in the US or UK in neuroscience? Any advice would be deeply appreciated — especially around how to frame my situation and make the most of what I do have.

1kqj4mm,"I hate my research PI, but she could very easily ruin my residency chances. What do I do?","To give a little bit of backstory: I volunteered in a neuroscience lab during undergrad. That’s where I met my PI—we’ll call her Dr. A. Dr. A is a highly intelligent woman, but she’s socially awkward and, at times, extremely ignorant and borderline racist. She’s a Gen Xer who believes in running yourself into the ground for your job (even if you're an unpaid undergraduate volunteer). For example, she once shared that she gave birth during her postdoc and returned to the lab the same day to run gels.


While I can admire her dedication and mindset, she completely fails when it comes to recognizing the efforts of others. During undergrad, the lab included multiple PhDs, a couple of master’s-level lab techs, and both medical and undergraduate students. We all got along well, and the environment overall had great energy. The PhDs, in particular, were supportive—they genuinely wanted to help us learn, grow, gain experience, and even earn publications. To some extent, Dr. A supported that too.

That said, there was clear favoritism among the students. Out of eight students, two of us consistently spent 20–30 hours per week in the lab doing unpaid grunt work, receiving no acknowledgment whatsoever from Dr. A. Meanwhile, her favored students only showed up for weekly lab meetings and occasionally helped with large group experiments—yet they received all the praise. I didn’t care about the praise itself, but I did care about the disparity in recognition and credit. These favored students were listed on significantly more publications—at least six each—despite putting in a fraction of the effort. I was lucky to be included on a couple, including one I wrote myself.


Despite all this, I genuinely enjoyed my time in the lab. The people I worked with made the experience worthwhile, and it sparked my interest in neuroscience and potentially neurosurgery.

Fast forward a few years: I’m now a medical student, and I’ve returned to the same lab. Dr. A is now a department chair at the medical school and plays a major role in residency selection. Nearly everyone from the original lab is gone, replaced by new faces. The environment has become deeply toxic.


The lab is now essentially run by the lab manager and a PhD researcher, neither of whom show any interest in conducting experiments or producing research. They spend their days in a shared office gossiping about others. Meanwhile, PhD students are treated like free labor, working 40+ hours a week while being regularly berated. Other PhD researchers work remotely, so we rarely interact with them. There are also a few med students, two undergrads, and two lab techs. None of us enjoy being there—the atmosphere is suffocating. Every time we enter the lab, it feels like a gloomy fog over us. We’re all treated poorly. 

For the past year, I’ve spent most of my free time—outside of school and studying—working in the lab, unpaid, trying to contribute and earn publications. Despite this, neither I nor the PhD students have received a single publication credit. In contrast, the lab heads are constantly praising two undergrads who come in less than 10 hours a week, mostly sit around chatting, and do minimal work. Yet they’re being listed on multiple publications this year, including one in a high-impact journal. The lab techs are also being credited on everything, due to Dr. A’s policy that “students have to work harder to get on pubs.” Essentially, the students who need publications the most—PhDs and med students—are being excluded, despite doing the majority of the work.


Dr. A has been largely absent throughout this time. As a chair, she spends most of her time in meetings, and when we do see her, she vents about her responsibilities and complains about our performance. She’s become extremely irritable, frequently snapping at us during meetings and publicly berating students. She particularly dislikes me—likely because I asked her for a letter of recommendation (which she made me write) and because I chose to take a few gap years after undergrad to work and travel rather than do unpaid research in her lab.

Recently, we collaborated with another lab on an experiment, but the samples we used had not been properly stored, resulting in poor staining and unusable data. I was responsible for the staining, and in a meeting with the other lab’s PI (Dr. F), Dr. A spent 30 minutes trying to get him to blame me. To his credit, he defended me the entire time, eventually conceding that while some errors might have occurred, nothing could be confirmed. That was enough for Dr. A to berate me in our next lab meeting, publicly questioning my competence, my future in medicine, and my potential to pursue neurosurgery.

As bad as that was, other students have had it worse—both publicly and privately. She once called a student on leave after a death in the family to criticize them for not being “committed enough.” She also frequently makes racially insensitive comments about Asian and Indian people. While they often come across as ignorant, the frequency makes me question whether there’s a deeper bias behind them.


All of this said, I desperately want to leave the lab. I’m exhausted from being yelled at, used, and unrecognized. But I’m stuck. I can’t switch labs within the department because Dr. A is the department chair and would block the move. I also can’t do research elsewhere without taking a year off, which isn’t feasible given my schedule. Burning this bridge would be satisfying, but Dr. A sits on the residency selection board, and she has significant influence. This is my home program, and realistically, it’s my best shot at matching into neurosurgery.


I have no idea how to move forward. I'm open to any advice. Sorry for the long read.

TLDR: Me and other students being treated like shit by potentially racist, abusive PI. Not getting any pubs. Potentially can't leave because she has pull with the residency board for the home program I want to attend.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1kqj4mm/i_hate_my_research_pi_but_she_could_very_easily/

After getting my master’s degree, I took a three month break then jumped right into my PhD program. I have four more classes to take until I’m done my coursework portion of my PhD, then I go straight to research and drafting my thesis.

Truly? I am so worn out. So beaten down with everything. Words cannot even describe the chronic exhaustion and unhappiness I feel. Imposter syndrome is starting to hit hard but that’s not even the worst part (yet). I am just so physically and mentally exhausted from taking college courses and doing research for the last seven years. I am dreading going to class on Wednesday. I crave change and something more outside of academia.

I want to get a job so badly but since the job market is so horrid, it’s been very difficult to find one in my field that I would be mostly happy with. I have been applying to public sector jobs since February and even though I made progress in quite a few interviews, I was never the chosen candidate. I’m trying to not lose the momentum of applying but it gets to a point where I applied to as many jobs as I could find.

I’m also currently 23, so I graduated HS in 2020. Never once brought work home from school from middle school and beyond lol. I think I could’ve done much better, I never necessarily struggled with my work, it was more so of a not paying attention, not taking notes, sleeping in class, being stoned out of my found issue. 

As an adult my life has changed a lot, I won’t go to far into it but I had some pretty severe mental health issues as a teenager which led to me do self destructive things. For some reason entering adulthood my outlook on life took a complete 180, especially after moving out of my parent’s house, moving from Wisconsin to Southern California, finding some actual success in life and realizing how good it can feel. 

At the moment I’m a class A truck driver, I actually enjoy doing it too but I think I’m capable of more. I also think that driving all day long and not really working aside people takes a major toll on me, I feel like I never have time for anything and I’m constantly exhausted. I make $28 an hour with just shy of 2 years of experience and my job isn’t over the road, it’s a local gig out of Irwindale, CA making residential building material deliveries around the greater Los Angeles area. On the other hand I have a friend who I went to CDL school with that has an MBA and absolutely hated his job as a project manager and got into trucking. 

One of my biggest concerns with going to school at an older than typical age is being rusty on different subjects, I don’t think I even remember how to do times tables lol and I’m sure you can tell my writing skills could use some improvement. 

I’m mostly drawn to getting into forest management. I’d like to maybe get some sort of job working with CalFire, BLM, the USDA, The U.S forest service etc…The idea of being a park ranger sounds pretty cool as well or even a forest management consultant with a logging company.

I have to ‘change the lives of my students’ while demonstrating excellence in my teaching. On top of that, I have to serve on 9 departmental/college/university committees while maintaining my facilities and advising students. I’m exhausted and I have no work-life balance.

I just got offered a full-time renewable lecturerer position at an R1 school. The thought of becoming a lecturer seems like the right move. The school has growing enrollments and the service requirements are resonable. They can still provide me with professional development funds each year and I don't have the pressure to produce. I can solely focus my attention on teaching and doing service that I enjoy.

1bj9rsw,Do I give up on this PhD?,"Hi everyone, 

I am in the 3rd year of my PhD (5 years if you include breaks/gaps) and I just feel exhausted and I have no idea what to do. I have two small children so I have taken gaps for Covid-19 and breaks when my baby got sick and was diagnosed with a condition. It has been a rough journey and what has got me through is having the most kind, supportive, and understanding supervisor. He has been so accommodating and I honestly do not feel worthy of his kindness and non-judgemental support. 

My PhD is in social sciences and I have 4 substantive chapters to write then my introduction and conclusion (70,000 words in total). I have written two of the substantive chapters and I am working on the remaining chapters. 

I feel like I cant do this anymore, I feel burned out and at the moment I am editing this 15,500 word chapter. It is chaotic and disorganised, it gives me anxiety just to open it so often I don't. I will scroll the internet, check emails, order stuff for my kids, cook their dinner, everything and anything before I sit down. On the one hand, I want to finish and prove to myself that despite experiencing the hardest 5 years of my life I did it. I want to set a good example for my kids and show them what mummy can do. I want to make the supervisor who has stood by me and believed in me when I didn't deserve it proud too. I truly want those things so why am I self-sabotaging? I keep telling myself if I cannot suck it up and do it then I do not deserve it at all. I feel so much anxiety, worry, and low self-worth. 

I do not know if anyone can relate but, I know what to do and I actually enjoy writing but what is painful is pushing through it. I feel this surge of cortisol and I don't even know what I afraid of but it feels like writing is what scares me. I am supposed to be writing now but I have just signed up to reddit and writing this post. I feel lost. 

I am not sure what I am even asking right now. Is there anyone who feels like this? What do you do to get past it? When do you know its time to give up? 

I sometimes feel like people like me cannot make it, I have two small kids one has special needs and I am on call for them for everything. I cook all their meals, take them to activities, do homework, therapy appointments, bedtime and everything else you can imagine that it takes to raise them. I love them with my whole heart but I just feel like pizza dough rolled so thin, I am rendered useless. 

Sorry for being so miserable.

ptf0z6,Tired grad student meals,"I’m a first year grad student and I found out this last summer that I have ADHD, which explains a lot. I’m the only person in my cohort that lives alone (almost everyone has an SO) and so I’m responsible for everything on my own and find that I’m exhausted 24/7. I’m wondering what your less than 10 minute meals are (healthy or unhealthy - eating is better than not eating) that you make when everything else is too much effort. 

At this very moment, I’m eating chocolate animal crackers with peanut butter but I also like to heat some refried beans from a can with some cheese in the microwave and eat that with chips. Hummus, yogurt, smoothies, and seasoned tuna packets are my other go-tos.

Other ideas? Bonus if it’s cheap, shelf stable, healthy, and/or requires little to no clean up!

Normally idc if people make racist jokes but at least make them funny…his just didn’t sit right and he mentioned how all the psych residents at his med school were Indian and his peds attending was Indian and he hated them all and blah blah blah and I just froze and was caught so off guard.

1krmsrd,I graduated today. I failed my defence the first time around.,"Just wanted to share for others who may have felt as hopeless I did on that day 3 years ago when I defended and got sent back into my program - that if you don’t pass your defence you can still graduate. 

Story time: 

Did a PhD abroad. Covid happened. Lost my supervisor after year 1 (he quit). University was not helpful in finding a new one. Actually they were actively unhelpful in finding a new one since they set me up with a prof in a different department who told me he would be my new supervisor if I took his course over the summer, which I did and then at the end of the summer when I asked he had his assistant tell me he forgot and had no funding for more students. 

Eventually I was going to master out but my old co-supervisor finally took me on, it wasn’t a perfect fit skill wise but it was good enough. By this time I had already been working on my PhD for 2 years. He was fairly junior and had only graduated one student before me. By year 3 I was out of money (my funding left with my first supervisor) so we figured we would just try and submit to defend. I was also in an accident and really struggling with school and dealing with pain at this point. In this country 3 years is normal anyways… we felt I had done enough. 

Unfortunately we misread the rules surrounding co-authorships and one of the panel members took great issue with this - basically me and a fellow student/co author on a paper tried to use the same paper as a whole thesis chapter because we both did two very different parts of a project that became one published paper. Because she submitted first it became against the rules for me to use that same chapter, and the committee stuck to that ruling and effectively “failed” me in my defence but determined that I had done enough work to merit another shot and sent me back into my program. 

It was horrible. Gut wrenching. To make matters worse the committee members were not nice, and they determined that not only did I have to redo that chapter but since I was going back into the program they wanted major revisions to the other chapters too. The worst part is - now I asked to start paying full tuition again myself, no funding at all, scholarship fully exhausted. 

I was so depressed it actually took me 6 full months to open my thesis document again, and for the first year I barely touched it. Eventually one day I had a moment in the mirror where I was like, if I don’t finish this it was all for nothing, 100k more student debt for nothing, you have to finish. From then on I took it super seriously.. and I wasn’t taking chances. Over the next 2 years -working part time on it to reduce my tuition costs and working a full time job- I published a new paper for the new chapter and fixed up the other chapters and got them fully published too. 

I submitted my thesis 4 days before the deadline of me being kicked out for taking too long… 

They thought I did such a good job on my revisions that I was told I didn’t have to re-defend, and today I walked the stage.

Don’t give up. PhDs are fucking hard!

1l3i9z7,My neurodivergence and CPTSD make it extremely hard for me to interact with my advisor and lab mates,"I have ADHD and CPTSD and I grew up in a very high stress hierarchical environment where I was punished for not showing respect for my seniors or following rules. As a PhD student when I interact with people more senior than me, especially my advisor, I often freeze and stutter. English not being my native language doesn’t help either. I feel I’m under the spotlight and any small thing that doesn’t go as planned can send me to a panic mode, where I zone out during meetings and compulsively look for signs that my advisor still likes me. I interpret a lack of exclamation marks in email or smiling in person as criticism and small suggestions as complete abandonment. I also don’t fit into the lab culture due to difference in life experience and age, but I feel abandoned by the world. I tried to fit in by making jokes like the other lab mates do but I feel exhausted after masking and sometimes my advisor finds my jokes to be “odd.” I try to avoid group meetings or lab events (where everyone else is a native English speaker) because I just get so drained after talking to them and masking. I even lose motivation to do research and the thought of doing research suffocates me with unknown fears I can’t even articulate. 

I’m currently seeing two therapists but help is minimal.

1mlpn6f,Paying up my Intellectual Debt,"I want to share how I'm getting on track, and perhaps this might help a lot of the guys stydying CS or wanting to get better at it.

So my story goes like this. I was a top class student in HS, in one of the top highschools in my country, (the type who goes to maths olympiads). By the time i graduated from there at 17, I was completely burned out. I went to college, passed it without much issues, was even ranked among top 10. But the issue was ""I didn't know sh\*t"" by the time i graduated. Since year 1, i was put behind by dudes who were programming since 12, and I was like ""This is perhaps not for me, i'm too theoretical for this"". The teachers on the hand, considered these guys level as the standard and just moved on; Data structures, linked lists, graphs .... etc.

Around 3rd year, final exam in compilers, was to code a mini-compiler from scratch, design a language ... etc within like 4 hours. I prepared for it a night before following a tutorial. The day of the exam, I just replicated the exact tutorial as if I had sharingan. Even the top students couldn't compete. I got first, but the truth is I never fucking understood ""Why"" i do this or that. I simply do it ! This was my pattern for years to come.

I graduated in 2018, worked at IBM for a while, then for a startup in Silicon Valley, then another one in Hong Kong. Yet with 7 years of experience, I spent it feeling like a fraud tbh. Work requires results, and I was good at results. Finding the solution regardless of how or why it works. Ex; I worked on a supercomputer project in my IBM days, a 50 petabytes migration of data, I couldn't write a SQL query without checking manual every damn time. Because my head was always saying ""You can go back to learn this later"", and I never did. There is always something more urgent.

Most guys don't know there were people vibe coding before AI. I was one of them! Just gluing code from here and there, without actually understanding what the code does, it simply gets you what you want.

I was reading a book by Disjkstra last week, and he was talking about ""GCD algorithm"", the great common divisor of 2 numbers. Elementary school level, right?. Yeah, i didn't know how to calculate it! I said Ok, perhaps I am a bit rusty. I pulled out VSCode, and wanted to implement the algorithm, I WASN't F\*CKING SURE HOW TO WRITE A FOR LOOP. Because for the last 2 years, i've been overlying on AI that i never wrote a damn line on my own!! I felt embarassed, long story short, I got to work to pay this intellectual debt because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I set up a plan for August. It goes like this : Catch up on High School maths, freshman year programming, Data Structures, Algorithms & complexity, python, SQL, and lastly linux. Then get to advanced discrete maths, competitive programming, reading code like I read english.

I put up the rule of : 200 hours. If I dedicated 200 hours of pure focus for humbly learning this, i might be proud of the level i'll achieve. My principle is : stay unapologetically Humble to go back to primary school lessons if necessary, and honest with myself of what I know and what I don't.

**## WEEK 1**

This is a program I vibe coded before starting to track my studying hours. On **day 1**, I went over my high school maths books, functions derivatives, calculus, arithmetics, vector spaces, differential equations... I uploaded that in my mind, passed a couple of high school exams to get it in there.

around middle **day 2**, i started with a [""noob"" level programming exercices](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/pierre-antoine.champin/enseignement/algo/exercices/index.pdf), (it's in french), like ""write a minimum function"" level. Humble, remember?

By the time i ended up the series, I was like ""Wow, now i can write a fibonacci recursively"", and GCD algorithm was a piece of cake.

**Day 3**, I read the entire book ""Computer Science Distilled"" cover to cover, and implemented each algorithm there, from simple min max, to graphs. IT WAS AMAZING. Like seriously buy a physical copy to support the author, he deserves it. At this point, I was confident. I knew recursion, backtracking, binary trees, sorting algorithms, when you use dynamic programming and when you use divide and conquer... etc. It all connected. Beware not to make my mistake and get stuck trying to solve a problem you are not equiped to solve yet, ( i spent 3 hours trying to solve 8 Queen's Puzzle to understand backtracking, while my recursivity skills were wacky)

**Day 4**, I went through the python official documentation, and just understand and try everything. By the time i finished, I was able to create a class, notations, lambda functions ... etc. Then i moved on to the algorithms and Data Structures. This was the plan.

My principle was this : From left to right. Everytime i start a new thing, CTRL-A + DEL. NO AI CODE GENERATION. If i get stuck somewhere, I ask for ""hints"" or ""bug lines"", never code

https://preview.redd.it/hahwvsptq1if1.png?width=2204&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a1e7169486fd513a471c93dc8e777600190d02f

And man WOW. I couldn't believe myself. The repitition of having to reimplement everything everytime made me able to just write a graph on move within a trie with ease. By the end, i took a look at an algorithmics MIT exam, and I was able to understand every question and answer most of them. heck, i was able to code them in my sleep. This is a sample question that looked like mandarin to me just, a week ago, i was instantly being able to tell it's False, and implement it with ease.

**Day 5-6** was about SQL, I had to go through everything from scratch following this Cheat Sheet. Created a database, tables, data and did all sorts of scenarios on it. Then I finished by going through a complete discrete maths problems ( [part I](https://itk.ilstu.edu/faculty/chungli/DIS300/dis300v1.pdf) and [part II](https://itk.ilstu.edu/faculty/chungli/DIS300/dis300v2.pdf) )

Around the end of part II, i stumbled on euclid's algorithm and I could understand it all in 1 glance. Even the floor division notation ( which you'll learn in part I ). and I was like ""Euclid's a smart dude"", i could see the beauty in this.

**What's the plan for week II ?**

It will be about exercices and exams. I have this set that I will go through one by one, and the principle is to do it (with time constraints). Alongside a set of exams around the end of the week.

Also I will go through this Algorithmics book now that I am equiped with the maths necessary and the complete understanding of the DSA.

I hope this post was helpful to those wanting to master the CS craft. It's very possible and easy, it only requires dedication. I was lucky to have a month for myself, that i'm dedicating completely to this study.

**Regarding Study Sessions :**

How i manage over 11 hours a day of work? Which some of you might see as ""too much"" or odd. ( Btw, this was a rythm I had for the 3 years of high school non stop , so I have a sort of muscle memory regarding long hours focus and dedication, and I have tips of this intense work already crafted and ready ). I don't recommend you going this intense if you feel it's too much, but just push yourself a little further and see how you react to it. Adapt yourself accordingly. Backtrack algorithm.

**When I feel sleepy, what do i do ?** Well, I put my face in a bucket of water for like 10 seconds everytime i feel sleepy. 2 coffee cups only before 16:00. After that time it disturbs your sleeping system. I sleep around 23:00 -- 23:30 ( already feeling exhausted by this time ), and waking up around 6:30, 7:00. I also make a juice of couples of lemons everyday (with little to no water), as an energy drink only. It gives a sudden electric charge to the body, which makes you feel a boost.

**Too much screen ?** That's why i use physical books and print what I can't buy, to prevent eyes fatigue.

Headache ? I only got a hard headache around day 6, to which i took an aspirin. I was very exhausted by this day which is very natural, hense why i kept it light with SQL and maths only. I'm not a fan of any industrially made products, especially for energy or headaches. I prefer very little to nothing.

**Sitting too much ?** Yeah, that one is inescapable. I work standing sometimes, i sit in others. I prefer sitting in a Zen meditation posture ( which i'm very comfortable doing for hours ), but try out and see what works for you.

**Tools I use ?** I'm on mac, For IDE i use [NOVA](https://nova.app/) and [Notable](https://notable.app/) for note taking only.

I hope your journey goes well guys. I'll keep you updated with how Week 2 went on. tschuss !",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mlpn6f/paying_up_my_intellectual_debt/

1le1gmv,Being sidelined by a colaborator in my first paper,"Hi everyone.

TL;DR: below.

I’m a third year PhD student in computer science.

A few months ago, a postdoc joined our group to work on a topic closely related to mine. At first, I was thrilled: he’s experienced, was supervised by a reputable professor during his PhD, and could bring useful insights to the paper I was already writing with my supervisors.

Initially, things felt collaborative. My supervisors and I agreed to include him as a author in exchange for feedback and maybe some additional ideas. He proposed two experiments: one he carried out himself, the other I was assigned to run. I was fully on board because my goal was to publish in a well-regared conference.

But things quickly shifted.

The experiment I was working on returned inconclusive results, despite his instructions. I voiced concerns several times, even in meetings. He kept insisting the results should be meaningful and eventually redid the whole experiment himself using my code — only to later admit the results weren’t conclusive either. Then, without any discussion, he quietly designed and ran a new experiment while I was on a two-week vacation.

The day before I left on vacation, he said we should rush to publish a preprint because his former colleagues are working on a similar idea and he wanted to “get there first.” I wasn’t fully convinced by the urgency, especially since the results were shaky, but agreed to resume when I returned. Everyone agreed to wait for me before moving forward.

When I came back, I was shocked: he had replaced the inconclusive experiment (after admiting the results were incoclusive) with a different one entirely, already implemented it, analyzed it, and started writing. Without me. I asked for time to re-implement and verify the work or understand the changes but he kept pushing for submission.

Then came the real shift. He declared the whole narrative I had built with my supervisors over several months “didn’t make sense” and would be criticized by reviewers. I disagreed, it made sense to me and my supervisors before he arrived. But we spent two exhausting weeks arguing over the framing of the paper. Eventually, we agreed we’d co-develop a revised outline with my supervisors. But he showed up to the meeting with a fully prepared version and pushed aggressively for it. My supervisors accepted it and I felt forced to agree just to avoid yet another round of endless arguing.

Now, he’s assigning who writes what. He even claimed that my main contribution was very similar to an existing work (which is totally not true and i convinced my supervisors with that after a long discussion and justifications).

He speaks with extreme confidence in meetings, dominates conversations, and presents his views as fact. Even when he’s wrong, my supervisors tend to side with him.

I’m still listed as first author, but it doesn’t feel that way. The paper no longer reflects the work I spent months building. My ideas were rewritten, reduced, or sidelined entirely. I feel like I’ve lost my voice. Every time I try to explain or stand my ground, I feel like I’m being “difficult.” My supervisors go quiet. They seem tired, maybe just eager to get the paper submitted.

I’m tired too. Deeply so. So now I’m cooperating, writing what I was told, following the new outline. But I don’t recognize the paper. I feel demoralized and disconnected from something that was originally mine.

**TL;DR:** A new postdoc joined our lab and quickly took control of my first paper. He pushed his own experiments, rewrote the entire narrative, and insisted on his outline, which my supervisors passively accepted. I’m still listed as first author, but most of my original work was minimized or removed. He’s dominant, fast, and presents his ideas as absolute. I’ve grown exhausted fighting back, and now I’m just trying to finish the paper even though I barely recognize it anymore.

Any advice or perspective would be appreciated. I want to grow from this, but I also feel deeply lost right now. Thanks 🙏 ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1le1gmv/being_sidelined_by_a_colaborator_in_my_first_paper/

1hfc587,"Use me as a case study for your PHD, If you have the time to read this whole thing ","I’ve been grappling with severe, life-disrupting sleep issues for as long as I can remember. My parents noticed irregularities in my sleep patterns since birth, and I began consulting doctors about these challenges at the age of 10. Now, at 26, my sleep remains erratic and unpredictable.

Typically, I stay awake for extended periods, often exceeding 24 hours, usually ranging between 36 to 40 hours, before succumbing to sleep. At times, I’ve remained awake for up to three days, feeling utterly exhausted throughout. This is followed by sleep durations that are equally irregular, making it nearly impossible to maintain a consistent schedule. While I’ve always had sleep issues, they’ve progressively worsened over time, though they’ve never been anywhere near healthy.

Over the years, I’ve pursued numerous treatments and received various diagnoses in an effort to understand and alleviate my condition. These include:

Medications:
	•	Hypnotics:
	•	Z-drugs: zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta)
	•	Benzodiazepines: alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), temazepam (Restoril)
	•	Orexin Antagonists:
	•	suvorexant (Belsomra)
	•	Mood Stabilizers:
	•	lamotrigine (Lamictal), valproate (Depakote)
	•	Sedative Tricyclic Antidepressants:
	•	amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Silenor), imipramine (Tofranil)
	•	Antihistamines:
	•	diphenhydramine (Benadryl), doxylamine (Unisom)

	•	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I): Engaged in structured sessions without significant improvement.
	•	Bright Light Therapy: Attempted to reset my circadian rhythm, but results were negligible.
	•	Exposure Therapy and Lexapro (escitalopram): These have been tremendously effective in managing my OCD and depression, reducing their impact on my daily life.
	•	Neurostimulation Devices:
	•	NeuroVaseline sleep device
	•	Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS)

I’ve also experimented with lifestyle changes, such as going months without any medications and even trying stimulants to aid sleep, as they help some individuals with ADHD. Despite these extensive efforts, I have not experienced meaningful relief. While some specialists have suggested Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder—a condition where one’s sleep-wake cycle is not aligned with the 24-hour day—I remain uncertain about this diagnosis, given the ineffectiveness of targeted treatments.

It’s worth noting that I come from a supportive family background. My parents are neurotypical, and I share a strong relationship with them. I have a brother with Down syndrome and autism, which has enriched my understanding of neurological diversity.

Interestingly, I’ve discovered that traveling by train induces deep, restorative sleep for me—something I struggle to achieve otherwise. The combination of gentle motion and ambient noise seems to facilitate this effect. This observation has led me to consider creating a sleep environment that mimics these conditions. However, I lack the expertise to develop such a solution and am seeking advice or collaboration from those with experience in this area.

I’m reaching out to this community in the hope of finding others who may have faced similar challenges or who can offer insights into potential avenues I have yet to explore. Your experiences, suggestions, or guidance would be invaluable as I continue to seek a resolution to my persistent sleep disturbances.

1j423ad,Relationship issues in the 11th hour of PhD time,"Edit: update. Thank you all so much for the support—it really helped me get through the last stretch!! I submitted my dissertation to the committee this afternoon; my defense is in two weeks. Feels like a huge weight off. (And you’ve collectively given me some things to think about/reevaluate going forward.)

US PhD, arts/humanities field, looking at alt-ac and industry jobs. I’m less than a week away from the hard deadline for sending my dissertation to the committee.

My spouse and I have been having problems for a while now, and one recurring element is that they have a lot of anger and resentment around my insistence on continuing my PhD instead of dropping out to get a regular job and provide more financial and emotional support during a period when they’ve been dealing with severe physical and mental illness. For the record: I have worked no fewer than three jobs at a time, including my GA role, for the entire time I’ve been doing the PhD, and have made enough money to cover my share of our household expenses, and often more; during the worst periods of their illness, I was also essentially their caregiver. 

Last night, we had another fight because I did not respond correctly to a bid they made for emotional support. I was in the wrong there—it was late, I was exhausted, and I didn’t try as hard as I should have. Things escalated, and eventually they said that “the day you finish that PhD will be the best day of my life.”

It’s objectively not as bad as some of the other fights we’ve had about my continuing in school (“you’ve ruined us with that goddamn PhD,” “you love that PhD more than you love me,” “your ego is so big that you can’t see how your worthless PhD is hurting us,” etc.). But this one hurt more than any of the others. I was so excited about being done, and now all I feel is dread and sadness. I don’t want to celebrate after my defense. I don’t even want to look them in the eye and tell them the outcome. I just want to go someplace dark and quiet, where I can be alone and apply for more jobs.

I know that my degree is not in a super lucrative or marketable area. (I finished my master’s during the peak of pandemic lockdowns and hiring freezes, and I came to this PhD program because I had no other job offers; it seemed like the best choice I could make at the time.) And I see how, for them, it just looks like selfishness for me to have kept going—and maybe it is, maybe I am seriously in the wrong here and just can’t understand that. But my PhD program was also, for a while, the only reason we had health insurance, and the means by which they accessed urgent medical care. I had no other viable options to quit to, and every time I asked myself “should I leave, are they right?” I would look at the money and know that I wouldn’t be making any more if I left. I’m just so sad about how all of this has turned out; it feels like a massive waste, like they’re right and I ruined our marriage for the sake of gratifying my ego.

1ixv8a5,The context-switching is killing me,"I'm in my second year of a tenure-track position. I'm teaching just two classes, and I have a writing project and a research project. I am finding that the context-switching is making me miserable and unproductive. I gather that what I'm doing is not even a heavy load for a professor. How do you deal with this?

Here are some details. Class #1, I've taught three times before. I have lecture notes and labs designed for each week, so teaching the course is relatively easy now. But I still need to spend the previous evening preparing and an hour or so before each lecture getting my mind absorbed in the material. That largely wipes out my mind's absorption in the other things. After each lecture and lab, my mind is usually coming up with ideas for what to do next, and it's hard to shut that off.

Class #2 is a first run of a completely new class. I figured out a way to teach it that is all classroom activity and no lectures by me. I assign readings to the students and have them give brief presentations. In class, we work collaboratively on a semester project. (There are only 7 students.) But I still need to get absorbed before and after each class, to figure out what's coming, to figure out technical stuff, and to figure out what readings to assign. This largely wipes out my mind's absorption in the other things.

The writing project requires me to learn a lot of new things. Each time I sit down to start on it, I am basically starting over, having forgotten all the context that I had last time.

The research requires focused, creative thinking. I get to it once a week, on Sundays from 12:00–3:00. Each time I start, I am basically starting over.

Trying to keep four projects in my head has been miserable and basically impossible. I estimate that more than 50% of my day is spent in the agonizing periods of shifting my attention from one thing to another. I seldom work on the same thing two days in a row, despite setting up a daily three-hour period first thing in the morning to work on the writing project. I've been too exhausted at that time and found it too hard to concentrate, and most mornings I've needed to work on something else that has become urgent.

In addition to the above, there are students that I am supposed to advise. Their questions lead me into long expeditions to find information about school policies and how to use the school's web pages. There are also departmental meetings and planning. I recently learned that my RTP (Retention, Tenure, and Promotion) is in trouble, because I've been mostly refusing to do service, and I didn't document all the stuff I've been doing in my classes in a way that the RTP evaluators want. I gather that documenting your work for RTP is a murky field where words don't mean what they ordinarily mean—meaning that I have yet another research project: to find out how to translate RTP jargon into what I need to say and do.

Next year, I am to teach three classes, while publishing research, doing more service, and advising more students. This sounds hopeless.

How do you deal with all the context-switching? How do you get sustained focus in this job? Or, if you never really focus on anything, how do you get any work done?",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ixv8a5/the_contextswitching_is_killing_me/
1lxd7je,Is it possible to survive a PhD when the postdoc is toxic and the PI won’t see it?,"Hi everyone,

I'm (25F) a first year PhD student currently working on a research project that involves both lab work and field sampling. For the past few months, I've been working alongside a postdoc who has gradually made my work environment feel hostile and emotionally draining. 

While the surface interactions might seem professional, I've been experiencing a buildup of what I can only describe as micro-aggressions and passive (turned active) hostility. These include:

* Dismissing my input or cutting me off during discussions.
* Speaking to me in authoritarian tone in front of others (screaming at me literally).
* Withholding information or deliberately leaving me out of team decisions (e.g., not telling me about meetings or field outings until the last minute, if at all).
* Making subtle accusations or comments about my personality.
* Making inappropriate comments
* Today, in a team meeting with our supervisor, he accused me of things I hadn’t done and made comments about my character that were deeply unfair and hurtful. He raised his voice and spoke over me repeatedly, making it difficult for me to express myself. He accused me of being aggressive and said I had ""abnormal behavior"". I stayed quiet during most of the exchange, not because I agreed, but because I didn’t want to escalate further. I tried to stay calm and collected, even as he raised his voice, cut me off, and made claims that simply weren’t true. I attempted to defend myself at first, but he kept blatantly lying, and it became clear that nothing I said would be heard. Our supervisor didn’t intervene, even as he raised his voice and attacked me personally. Her only comment was that she didn’t want tension in the unit. In the end, I chose to take the high road: I apologized for things I didn’t do and suggested that we work on improving our communication moving forward. But I walked away from that meeting feeling completely crushed, frustrated and very humiliated.

Now, I feel exhausted. I’m anxious. I keep doubting myself, even though I know deep down I’ve acted with integrity. I’m documenting things carefully, but I’m not sure if it’s “serious enough” to escalate (or even how to do that) or how to regain emotional balance in a situation like this.

For context, our research unit is relatively small and operates quite independently from the main university administration. It's made up of just a few people: myself (a PhD student), the postdoc in question, our supervising professor, and a newly arrived lecturer. Occasionally, we also have a few final-year undergrad students working on their thesis projects, but they don’t spend much time in the unit and aren’t very involved in the daily workflow. Because of this setup, there’s very little oversight, and interpersonal dynamics play a huge role in how the work environment feels. I feel very isolated.

What’s made all of this even more confusing is that I’m not the only one who’s struggled with him. Over time, several people outside of the unit who had to interact with him, even briefly, have come to me privately and asked how I manage to work with him on a daily basis. Still, I’ve always chosen not to speak badly about him or share my personal experiences, because I believed it wasn’t noble or professional to talk behind a colleague’s back. I kept hoping things would improve with time. But at this point, I’m mentally and emotionally drained. Ironically, he himself speaks about everyone behind their back, including people we work with closely. I’ve heard him criticize collaborators, students, even our supervisor when she’s not around.

We live in a 3rd world country if this is relevant to mention. My supervisor has a strong bond with him. He was her PhD student before I joined the unit, and from what I understand, he stood by her side during difficult times in the past. He’s now extremely involved and takes care of a lot of things for her without ever complaining. Because of that, she really values him and  trusts him without question. The dynamic makes it very difficult for me to express concerns or be taken seriously when things go wrong.

To make things more complicated, our work is deeply intertwined; our projects overlap, and many of my tasks depend on coordination with him. So avoiding contact or minimizing collaboration isn’t a realistic option right now.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  
How did you cope with a toxic or undermining colleague, especially when they hold more seniority than you?  
Is there a healthy way to set boundaries without burning bridges?

Any advice or words of support would mean a lot right now. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I can not switch labs as this is the only lab in the country working in this field (it is not extremely specific, we just don’t have researchers in this field, 3rd world country…) and going abroad is not an option at the moment.

1fphqvv,Feeling Ashamed ,"I am a professor of color, and my class consists of students from various nationalities, with the majority being brown, followed by black and white students. I’m currently teaching a subject that isn’t my favorite, but I agreed to take it on when asked. I’m doing my best to simplify the material and provide as much information as I can.

However, during the second half of today’s class, I felt exhausted from speaking and explaining. I lost some interest in going over the latter part of the lesson, which I felt was fairly self-explanatory. While I could have gone into more detail, I was drained, and only gave 1 or 2 points, as much of it seemed repetitive and I didn’t have much more to add on that topic.

I noticed that some students, particularly those of a different background from mine, began smirking and smiling as if I wasn’t doing a good job.

Later, one of the white students commented that the material was too deep and requested more teaching resources, despite the fact that I already provide lectures, books, and other materials. It seems they aren’t putting in the effort themselves and expect me to explain everything in full detail.

Now, I’m feeling like I haven’t been honest with myself or the class, and I’m ashamed that I didn’t explain the material more thoroughly. I’m also sensing that my students may not like me as their professor and perhaps view me as less knowledgeable.


Update; Thank you all so much for your kind words and for sharing your strategies—I definitely plan to apply some of them. I've realized that I've been too hard on myself, and that’s something I need to improve by being more compassionate toward myself.

Regarding different nationalities, I was concerned that native English speakers might not fully understand me, as while my English is good, it may not be perfect. I wasn’t sure if this was a genuine issue or just something I was overthinking.

People from different backgrounds have been very kind to me, though I’ve had a bit of a challenge with one student from my own ethnicity who tends to arrive late and ask questions that seem off-topic.

I’m committed to working harder and doing better next time. I can’t thank you all enough for your support and knowledge. Thank you once again!

I graduated somewhat recently in physics and applied maths with a cumulative GPA of 4.00. I've seen a lot of posts here on r/college over the last few years of people freaking out over their grades and/or looking for advice on how to do well, and maybe some of what I've learnt could help others. Obviously, this stuff is aimed towards STEM since that's all I really know, but general tips map over to the humanities. These tips are in no particular order, just whatever comes into my head. Most are probably (very) obvious, and it's long. I've also TA'd for numerous classes, so if you have more specific questions r.e. maths or physics study or heading into grad for either, I can answer in comments or PM. This is certainly not an exclusive list, it's just a general one.

tldr: 

 - Go to class

 - Pay attention in class

 - Do the work

 - Put effort into the work

 - Plan ahead

 - Read the goddamn syllabus

 - Get help early

 - If you need accommodations, get them

 - Be nice to the professor

 - Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc

 - Study to the tests/exams

 - Don't say you'll do better ""next time""

 - Know how you learn best

 - Have your priorities straight

 - Be prepared to let it all go


--------

**Go to class**.

It shouldn't need to be said, but there it is. Even if the class is boring as all hell and you think you already know it all, go anyway. Some classes take attendance, some give pop-quizzes, some offer extra material not available online or in any recordings/notes, but it's just a good idea to be present regardless. Our brains form associations really quickly, so you'll learn better in the lecture hall that you always learn in rather than sitting at the desk you regularly play computer games at. You'll also be able to ask for clarification in real time, which no recording or personal study will ever afford you. Plus, it gets you in the professors good books, or at least helps keep you out of the bad books. That's incredibly important. 

**Pay attention in class**.

Once you're there, you need to actually listen. No browsing on your phone, no checking twitter on your laptop, no chatting with your neighbours, and no work from other classes. You should be paying such ardent attention that you are exhausted at the end of a 1-hour lecture. You will undoubtedly fail occasionally, but you need to force yourself to refocus every time. Do whatever you have to in order to keep paying attention. For me, that meant always taking notes by hand even if notes were printed and handed out to us by the professor before class. I never revised by my own notes, but it was important to take them anyway. The more effort you put in to learning it the first time around, the less work you need to do outside of class.

**Do the work**.

Again, should be pretty clear why, but this is the biggest reason why people fail IME. It's actually really *hard* to fail a class if you give every assignment a proper try and hand them all in on time. Even if you know you've left it way too late and can't possibly get it completed, a half-assed 50% is magnitudes better than a 0%. 

**Put effort into the work**.

Never hand in any piece of assessment as ""good enough"". Your final-copy 5-page assignment in maths should originally be a 20-page draft when you include your additional derivations and long-working. Don't skip steps: it doesn't make you look smarter, it just makes mistakes easier. I will happily expand out factors term by term if it avoids a mistake. Do your work neatly and follow standards in setup/layout. Chicken-scratch ramblings don't get a prize; the less pleasant your work is to mark, the less lenient markers will be. Remember that there is a human marking your work, so intersperse the maths with some words explaining what you're doing and why. You can still be awarded marks for correct reasoning even if you make a foolish mathematical error somewhere. This also applies to exams and tests: if you make a mistake somewhere but can't find it or don't have time to fix it, make a note of it on the paper. If you really run out of time, list the steps you *would* have taken. That'll get you something too. Also do sanity checks on your results: you've probably made a mistake if the ball is travelling faster than c.

**Plan ahead**. 

Life is shitty, and shitty things happen unexpectedly. Maybe your car breaks down, maybe your neighbours keep you up with loud music all night, maybe your dog is sick, maybe your computer fails spectacularly, maybe the power gets cut off, and maybe you just plain forget something. Have reasonable contingencies for these sorts of events. Leave a little earlier to account for any delays in travel, finish your work a day or two earlier, keep backups in multiple places, email yourself copies of important documents, set copious alarms, and have some kind of planner. Know when difficult weeks are coming up and start things earlier than usual to reduce workload later on. Being organised is probably the *most important* thing you can do to ensure success. Your memory and ability to react quickly and reasonably to complex situations is really not that great, so craft these safety nets ahead of time. It's enough to simply have a plan that you are aware of. Fix problems *before* they are problems. 

**Read the goddamn syllabus**.

Don't get caught out by participation marks after you've already missed half of the lectures. Know how much different sections are worth and roughly when they are due (some due dates may change). Be aware of minimum requirements, especially for lab classes. All of my classes had rules that you had to get >45% in all of the lab, homework, and exam portions in order to pass the class. If you got 70% overall but 40% in the lab portion, too bad - you fail. A syllabus is not a legally binding contract, but they are quite important nonetheless. Also, **keep the syllabus**. Partly in case you need to dispute something, but also, in some situations when transferring credits, universities will ask for the syllabus from your classes to judge equivalency. They are usually required to be from the correct semester/year as well IME, so no sneakily grabbing a newer one.

**Get help early**.

If you struggle to understand something in week 1, get help for it in week 1. Not week 2 and not week 13, *week 1*. Your problem with the content doesn't go away once the class moves on, it just starts festering under the surface and jeopardising everything you learn past that point. This also applies to mental health or other extreme personal circumstances. Professors and administrators can do a lot to help you early on in semester with medical withdrawals and the like, but they can't do much at all to help past a certain point. Don't look at asking for help as ""begging"", but rather as taking agency over your own learning and your own life, and recognising when you need more information/support to work at your best. You cannot control what happens to you, but you *can* control how you deal with it. 

**If you need accommodations, get them**.

If you know you have ADHD or are prone to mental illness like Depression, get the required documentation and get accommodations from your university. It isn't some dick-measuring contest to see how long you can go without your meds and there's no gold star for foregoing all treatment. University life is *tough* for a lot of people. If you try to go it alone and fail, *you* are the one who suffers from that sort of hubris. I had accommodations for issues with concentration and processing speed. My internals and labs were great, but my early tests were consistently 20% lower; having accommodations simply levelled the playing field and made my grades more regular. Real life is not like an exam and you do not need to sit under the same conditions. If you need an extra 30 minutes or a quiet room to work in, get it. Having these accommodations can also help with requests for extensions or leniency in marking if you suddenly fall ill. It certainly saved my ass a few times. 

**Be nice to the professor**.

(Assuming they're a reasonable human being, of course) In many classes, the professor has a lot of power. They set the rules of their class and they are also free to bend those rules as they see fit. If the professor likes you, they may give you an extension when you're stressed out or simply forget homework, will invest more time and energy into your learning, offer you extra opportunities in their field, act as great letter writers later on, and simply be a great addition to your network. Many of the things I achieved during undergrad came from my contacts with professors, who then pointed me towards friends with good opportunities in national labs and prestigious universities. The person with the personal contact wins every time. 

**Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc**.

Professors are actually kinda clueless when it comes to the running of the department, but the local head administrator knows all. Befriend the person who's actually in charge and you'll never be stuck in endless loops of administration bullshit ever again. Hiring opportunities inside *and* outside of the department flow through this person first, as do many applications afterwards. Forms you need to fill out will pass this point as well, and they are often the ones with a tight hold on the money-strings. They also know their equivalent in other departments, and can get you priority meetings/appointments. They are typically well-known and very well-liked, and their seal of approval on you carries weight. 

**Study to the tests/exams**.

Don't do 100 problems out of a dusty textbook your professor has never used as the format and method of solution will be slightly different. When you're first learning something, using multiple distinct methods can throw you off and you gain nothing from the exercise. Look at previous exams if available through your library to get a feel for the general format, as questions tend to be similar over the years. If these are not available, then use previous questions set to you or other questions from the same pool. Study strategically to match. 

**Don't say you'll do better ""next time""**.

So many of my friends would get 60% in an assignment, brush it off immediately, and say they'd just make up for it next week. They never did. Assume your grades will *decline* over the course of the semester as you become stressed and burnt out, so put effort in early. If you get a poor mark, organise to discuss your mistakes with the professor ASAP. For the next assignment, ask to have it checked a day or two *before* you submit it. Professors and TAs are usually more than happy to review drafts of substantial work before submission, you just need to ask and be willing to hear criticism. It is not an attack on your character, they are literally just telling you what you need to do to earn a higher grade by the rubric they have. 

**Know how you learn best**.

If you do your best work between 7pm-9pm, then save tough things for that time. If you find it hard to get up and pay attention in 8am classes, try to avoid signing up for classes at that time. If you know which professors teach to the style you like to learn in, take their section if available and suitable. But always be reassessing these methods. If the evidence of your results isn't backing up your statements, you need to figure out what's going wrong and fix it ASAP. Keep your fingers on the pulse at all times and be ready to adapt. 

**Have your priorities straight**.

Know how important your grades are to you from the beginning and stick to that. After a terrible run in high school, I decided that I wouldn't settle for any kind of mediocrity and whenever I lost focus, I reminded myself of that goal. Don't say that you want top grades and then act completely opposite to that statement. But don't go too far the other way either: if you get to the end of your degree and have nothing but a 4.0, then you've wasted a lot of your time. You need to have experience in your field and other things going for you. Know what is important/necessary and what is not for your specific goals and living situation. If you need a supermarket job to pay the bills, keep it. If you really don't need the money, find something more constructive and relevant to do with your time. 

**Be prepared to let it all go**.

Getting ""good"" grades is a matter of effort, planning, and natural aptitude in some measure. Graduating with a 4.0 specifically is pure luck. Even a headache on the day of an important exam can send things down the drain, and no matter how well you plan ahead, random events *will* affect you. I failed in plenty of the above tips over the last 3 years. I skipped out on weeks of classes because I thought I knew everything, I didn't plan ahead properly and had horrible all-nighters, I tried to get through without disability accommodations, I allowed myself to get so ill as to not hand in assignments, and I crammed for exams. Blind luck and the curve pulled me through every time, but it could easily not have. Finishing with a 4.0 is nice, getting that sweet medal is cool, but it means next to nothing the day after grades are released. After you land that first position, it really won't mean anything at all. Keep the achievement in perspective and don't lose sight of the things that really matter at this point in your life, whatever that point is. But if you want that 4.0 just as a personal goal and keep sight of everything else, don't let people dissuade you from it or convince you that you should care less. If you want to set the bar high, make sure it's feasible but then hold yourself to it. ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7mm5ol/my_guide_to_a_40/

I could also bring up my undiagnosed ADHD/PTSD... I was dealing with emotional abuse at home by a parent, and had just experienced a breakup of a 4 year engagement where we were living together... I was in love with him, but towards the end of the relationship, he was gaslighting me quite a bit (before the word gaslighting became a word that's thrown around!). The program was tough. Challenging. I had anxiety, depression, insomnia, ADHD.... 

Needless to say, I struggled. I suppose the criteria for the final practicum contained certain requirements that I could not meet. I remember them pointing them out to me and giving me a second chance. I tried another practicum at another location with another supervisor. Embarrassingly, I flunked that, too.

They ended up kicking me out of the program, denying me the master's despite having taken thousands of dollars of tuition from me over the course of the 2 academic years, and despite me having passed all of my coursework with flying Colors. I know I somehow did not pass the practicums but they seemed quite heartless and uncaring, not bothering to see if there’s another way I could succeed, considering I’d just passed all the courses and the other practicums. Not taking the time to find out what’s going on with me. 

Do you think the university failed its institutional responsibility ? I feel like universities have a duty of care to support students, especially in challenging circumstances. The fact that I was cut off without support and no remediation or understanding points to a failure on their part to adequately fulfill that duty. 

They neither understood nor explored why I was struggling (trauma, undiagnosed ADHD, etc.). I believe they should’ve offered meaningful, trauma-informed support during that period. They also should’ve given me a real chance to succeed — not just a re-do, but support structures to make that re-do fair.  There zero attempt at repair or follow-up after my dismissal, I was just cut off after failing the re-do of the 2nd practicum.

Shouldn’t a university — especially one preparing people for caring professions — be asking: “What happened to this student?” “Did we give her what she needed to succeed?”
“If we failed to do that, what’s our responsibility now?” Or am I completely out of my mind? 

I spoke to the Ombudsperson a month or 2 after, but it did no good. I tried to appeal the decision to no avail. I was exhausted and dejected. 

I fell into a shame spiral after this… it was awful. The fact that I wasn’t failing in general just makes this outcome so severe. No degree granted to me, despite having completed the program’s academic core, with good grades. Should a practicum failure really nullify two years of successful graduate-level work?
	
What are your thoughts on this, and has anyone ever experienced something like this? If so, what happened/what did you do? I am thinking of reaching back out to the school. Do you think that’s futile? In my angriest moments, I even thought about seeking legal counsel and suing the university. i know that’s dramatic and maybe irrational. 

But this institutional decision had disproportionate and lifelong consequences on me, and I felt like I was kicked to the curb.

I’m also thinking of applying to another, similar program that might be a better fit for me, and seeing if I can use some of the courses I completed in this program as transfer credits. I don’t wish to take graduate-level stats more than once!
Thanks in advance for your input.

1lk6inj,My degree is draining me,"Hey everyone,

I'm feeling really stuck right now and don’t know what to do. I graduated in the summer of 2024 with a degree in Japanese linguistics. Getting my bachelor’s was already stressful enough, but I wanted to finish it and have a degree—partly because of pressure from my family. After graduating, I applied for a Master’s in Japanese Language and Culture, which is basically the continuation of my program at the same university. I didn’t have the time or energy to explore other options or prepare for entrance exams in a different field, so I just went with it.

I started my Master’s in September 2024, and I honestly hate it. I’ve realized that this isn’t something I want to do in the future, and I regret choosing it as my career path. I know switching fields or dropping out isn’t the end of the world, but I’m torn between quitting now or just pushing through to finish it. I somehow managed to complete my first year, but I feel completely drained, mentally exhausted, and lost. I have zero motivation for anything related to this degree, and my mental health has gotten worse.

To make things more complicated, I applied for an exchange program and I’m supposed to go to Japan this September to finish my degree. Everyone around me keeps saying it’s an amazing opportunity, but to me it feels like a massive waste of time. I can’t stop thinking that I could already be doing something else and gaining experience in a field I actually care about. I feel like a total scaredy-cat for not having the courage to switch sooner.

Right now, I’m sure I don’t want to pursue a career in this field, and finishing the degree feels like a waste of time and money. I’m also not planning to live in Japan long-term. But at the same time, part of me thinks I should just get it over with. I’m 25, and if I decide to finish this degree, I’d need to work while studying for another one—which I hope would be manageable.

Sorry for the long post. I know the final decision is mine, but I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Side note - I’m also not naturally good at languages, which makes this all even more frustrating.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lk6inj/my_degree_is_draining_me/
1n2ic53,Dropping out because my job doesn’t work with my program…,":( I took 3 mostly online summer classes and just started the fall semester (feels like my first “real” semester) and realized that there’s classes in the program that I just can’t make work with my job (for example, Monday 9-5 or Saturday and Sunday 9-5…I work weekends F-M, I can’t quit for financial reasons nor would I really want to anyway). I asked about taking those online through another institution while staying in the program, but I don’t know if that’s a real option and if it even makes sense. Now it has me rethinking everything.

I don’t want to worry about turning in assignments and what’s due and having to miss plans due to school. I don’t want to be stressed all the time and miserable. I just want to be happy and free and I’d love to invest in other areas of my life like hobbies again, family, and friends. I was already considering dropping out before this, but going to my 2 classes this week got me excited. :(

I think I’d love learning the material and I’d feel so accomplished and having the degree would open up a whole new world career wise (counseling) that I’d love…..but I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

I’m going to feel embarrassed and like a failure if I drop out. But I also don’t want to spend the next 3+ years of my life absolutely miserable. I think I’d be miserable but that the degree would pay off years down the road. But maybe I could do an online program instead..?

Idk. Just sad and don’t know what to do. I’m already so stressed and exhausted mentally all the time without school being a factor. Maybe it’s best for me to drop out and really focus on my wellbeing. Idk. I just don’t wanna regret my decision and feel like a loser or like I “gave up”….but if taking the courses somewhere else isn’t an option…idk why I’d stay when I’ll just have to drop out after this semester anyway. That would be more work and just make it even harder to leave since I’d have made friends and connections.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n2ic53/dropping_out_because_my_job_doesnt_work_with_my/
196e0hk,I am exhausted.,"This is a bit of a vent to get things off my chest. I apologise for the long post. This is something I have been writing, deleting, and rewriting for some time now. Given that the case is now with the police, I am writing this as anonymously as possible but this is also something I need to write and get off my chest.

I worked hard to graduate from a well-ranked university with more papers than needed, excellent teaching evaluations, and even an award for my research. I had my choice of TT or postdoc positions. I went with a postdoc at with a leader of my field. I was able to help them shape the lab; I was involved in every hiring decision, multiple papers at field-leading venues, and in a number of grants. All was going well until I got my first major grant. ""What?"" you may ask at this point, getting a grant and becoming a PI is a sign of joy.

Just a couple of month after the public announcement of the grant, I got an email from the funding agency: multiple email accounts kept emailing the agency with all sort of accusations about me. Most worrying of them is that I plagiarised my PhD. It felt both bizarre and, yet, scary even if I knew that it was untrue. The so called ‘evidence’ were a collection of random sentences there and here; some 6-7 words definitions (most with a correct citation mind you) and some random statements. If all put together, it would barely account for more than half a page out of a 250+ pages dissertation. Ironically, some of the alleged sources ‘that I copied from’ and I talk about completely different things in our works (imagine something like I talk about organic chemistry and they talk about gender studies) but it happened that we have the same 6-7 words in similar sentences. Some examples were even from articles released *after* my own dissertation. All too bizarre. Still, someone went throughout my document and, based on their email, googled sentence-by-sentence my entire thesis.

My current dean, chair, and postdoc advisor all went through the allegations and told me how stupid the allegations were. I provided a formal statement to the funding agency and they were satisfied —they even renewed my funding two years after. My alma matter conducted its own investigation and decided that the allegations were unfounded. After all, at my alma matter all doctoral thesis go through TurnitIn at the time of its submission and the committee has to review and sign on any similar text. To my disagreement, they decided not to release a public statement.

However, this is did not go away. The person continued. First by sending emails to people in positions of power at the university, then by emailing random colleagues within and without the university. They even setup a blog with the allegations. They tried to flood the internet, social media, and so on. I had colleagues emailing me directly to express sympathy. Others, emailed my PhD and postdoc advisors—both which kept me in the loop—to express concern, surprise, or some out of a “I need to do something” feeling.

The advice I got from a lawyer was to ignore it all. This was harder than one thinks, but I tried my best. I ignored them and carried on my work. I was promoted to a research scientist position and managed to get tenured. I got another grant —and once again I had to explain to the grant’s agency that the allegations they got through an anonymous email are untrue.  I continued forward, now with my own lab,  publications at top venues, was asked to serve at various committees, and even unsolicited invited to apply to some TT and tenured positions.

Did all this character assassination damaged my career? Maybe; I had my share of grant rejections since this started —a couple with quite vague rational. Maybe not; arguably my career flourished and I even a new job. Yet, I cannot stop thinking that I could have done better if this was not in my mind. I simply cannot know. In some ways, not knowing feels worse to me. It builds a lingering thought of doubt at before every submission and a concern after each rejection. Even when I have positive news, I wonder if I should share them or not. If it will trigger a new round of stalking or not.

I am annoyed; my institution’s support has been limited to counselling sessions to help me cope and ignore. Our legal department has been completely useless. I have gone to the police; the case is with them but they do not consider this high on their priority list as no direct threats were made.

Spending the past years afraid of celebrating any wins in public made me exhausted and annoyed with the public-facing aspects of the job. We are expected to be ‘perfect’ and even considered ‘public figures,’ almost like politicians, but without any of their perks. Coming here on Reddit, I saw posts of colleagues getting really creepy emails from students, stalked, facing similar character assassinations to mine, and even outright sexually harassed by colleagues and students. I sometimes wonder why we bother with our profession. An industry job would have gotten us a bigger pay cheque and probably less exposure to all these crap. Yet, here I am, working 12-14 hours a day, including weekends and holidays.

Tomorrow, I am moving to another institution for a TT position. A bit of a weird move to move to TT from tenured, but my future institution is closer to friends and family, amongst the top of the world for my field, and the position comes a generous starting package to setup a new research focus for the department —including me hiring new faculty for that. I know that the moment that my move becomes public, the new institution will get the same emails. I rationally know that they will discard it. I know that the person will post again on social media and I rationally know that nothing will come out of that. One of my existing collaborator in the new institution—a department chair for a different department than my own–told me not to care as none will. Yet, I still worry and feel stressed for being able to have a new start.

1mi3ouj,I'm tired,"This isn't a post *asking* for advice - I just need to vent, and since I have no one around me to vent to, this is the best place I can go. In saying that though, I am all ears to anyone with advice on how to feel better.

I'm on my second postdoc as an inorganic chemist, my second time moving to a new country (literally on the other side of the world) and this is my second meltdown in my post-PhD career.

My first postdoc was tough, and not nearly as productive as I would have imagined or liked, but I learnt a lot from it, and am now seeing some of the work I've done be published (~6 months after finishing). My mental health suffered quite a lot during my second year there, mostly due to some issues with my boss, and the relationship we had, which started off very nice, really deteriorated towards the end of it. Alas, I finished, and got out..

.. into another postdoc. I was pretty happy to secure this job, as when I interviewed for it, I hadn't published anything new since finishing my PhD. Nevertheless, recommendations (from my PhD supervisor, not my postdoc supervisor) were sufficient to get me the job. I'm in a slightly different, albeit similar, field. The working conditions here are much nicer (so far), but I have so little direction (and I fear that I'm starting to lose motivation too) and have had no successes in the first 3 months of being here, which doesn't feel too abnormal, but all of the projects I'm working on feel like absolute pipe dreams, and this stresses me out. I'm starting to question if I'm creative or innovative enough to continue in an academic career, and if that's the case, then why am I even bothering with a postdoc?

On top of this, I'm tired of not being able to speak the language here, I'm tired of not having any friends here, I'm tired of my life milestones all being on hold while I'm here, and I'm tired of missing out on things like my friends' weddings, and for what? A slim chance at a job that I will probably end up feeling just as bad in, if not worse.

I'm trying so hard to be excited about the opportunities I've got to do cool science and live in a new place, but there are so many things that just make me feel exhausted about this part of my career.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mi3ouj/im_tired/
1ayhg37,"I've decided to be blunt, and it's working. (Long post, but intriguing, at least to me)","I, like so many others,  have had it with the more obnoxious habits undergrads seem to have developed (the helplessness, the neediness, the whining, the need to act panicked about things, etc).

So, one day I had a migraine coming on and my filter became a bit faulty. I became blunt in my responses to the more irritating behaviors. To my surprise, it worked out better than being tactful ever had. I tried to be blunt and call out the behaviors the next class, it worked even better the second time. Why is this? I have no idea, maybe I'm doing it in kind of a funny way so it helps them take the observations? I don't know. I would like to know.

Case in point, we had an inclass activity. They each got a term and a definition. They had to tell each other the definition they had and try to find the person who had the definition for their term. It was more structured then it sounds. Picture speed dating but with key terms.

Due to having to move, be engaged, and talk to another human they of course lost their minds. Claiming they didn't understand, all (or rather most) being just needy and helpless all at once. I have to give it to one girl, she didn't know her term. She Googled it and I saw her search for it on her phone.  I asked if she was looking up the term, she said yes, and I excessively praised her for taking some action to solve her own problem. 
Then a bunch of them pulled out their phones to look up the word. They clearly knew how, but had chosen not to. 

Anyway, once the on-slot of whining started, I told them to just stop talking for a second. I literally said, ""Yo! Stop for one second! Just stop talking!"" They did. I then said, ""First, what's with hitting the panic button so fast? No one is going to die, you won't get hurt, nothing bad is going to happen. We're playing a game. Stop taking everything so seriously. Struggle is part of learning. If you never struggle, you'll never learn."" I asked again why they had panicked, forcing them to think of reason. They realized, there was not a reason. They had defaulted to panic mode. 
They were exhausted by the end of the activity. I think students are used to getting out of doing things with the helpless routine and now lack mental stamina in a way. 

Another time I a student ask me something I had clearly already told the class. I noticed she had some tv show playing on her laptop that she was watching. I asked if it was a good show. She said ""yes."" I then said, ""maybe don't watch it in class. I told everyone that information and you were probably watching the show and missed it. I think that's the problem. I'm not repeating myself for TV. I love TV. I used to work in television. But if you listen to what's happening here and don't watch a show, I guarantee we will never have this exact problem again."" She agreed, and we moved on. 

What is this?! There's been no complaints to anyone above me, I eavesdrop on them all during lab and have heard zero rumblings of discontent. They have actually been friendlier and more engaged in class.

1kz00ge,Feels like I'm failing on all fronts,"Hi everyone — I’m a rising M4 and I just… don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. I’ve been bottling so much up for so long, but it’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m either cursed or losing my mind. I wanted to share what the past year and a half has looked like, and maybe just find some solidarity, support, or clarity.

**Neuro:** My first rotation. Constant anxiety. My attending would humiliate students in front of the whole team and pimp in a way that felt cruel, not educational. It felt like a sink-or-drown experience and I left questioning my intelligence and confidence.

**IM:** I thought this one would be a turning point. But I was placed on a team where the attending spent nearly all 10 days bashing medical students — saying we didn’t deserve to graduate or get an MD — *even though he went to the same med school and residency program as us*. The team dynamics were cold and unwelcoming. There was no teaching. I felt like an imposter every day.

**OB:** A nightmare. On the **first day**, our attending warned us that “some people here hate students from your school.” The PAs wouldn’t let us do anything besides hold the patient's leg during delivery. If we tried to attend morning rounds or sign-out, we were told to “just go sit with the nurses.” When the site director asked our names, we told her, and she said “I could have guessed that” — three students: one white, one Indian (me), and one Middle Eastern. It felt like thinly veiled racism. The nurses kept us on the far side of the L&D floor where we couldn’t hear overhead pages or track what was going on unless we were pacing back and forth constantly. I tried to be engaged, but no one cared. The rotation was so bad that by the end of the month, the school *put the site on probation* and stopped sending students there.

**Peds:** Comparatively better, but long hours, high emotional toll. I was physically and emotionally exhausted the whole time. Just surviving the day became the goal.

**Surgery:** I expected it to be hard — but not dehumanizing. I worked myself to the bone for attendings who couldn’t even remember my name. The days were long, but what made it worse was how invisible I felt. No feedback. No mentorship. Just constant exhaustion and dread.

**Family Medicine:** Fine overall, but even this didn’t go smoothly. Because I delayed Step 1, I had to do FM with the class below me. You’d think admin would coordinate my shelf and OSCE schedule accordingly — but *I heard nothing* until the **day before** the exam. I had been emailing and trying to confirm for days. I had to chase them down just to take the tests I needed to graduate. Just another example of how I constantly have to advocate for basic things I shouldn’t even have to worry about.

**My AI (Internal Medicine):** This was supposed to be the redeeming arc. My mentor — the program director — assured me that this would be a totally different experience, especially since it’s at the main teaching hospital. Instead, I was assigned to a team with only **one resident and one attending**, while other teams had two residents. Our first attending refused to take any patients. He’d “pretend” to see patients and just expect us to figure out the plan, even when he hadn’t met them. He refused to give a proper signout to the next attending, saying the resident and I knew everything (?!). Our second attending picked only stable patients for himself and dumped them on us the moment they spiked a fever or had a complication — **without any handoff or context.** I was expected to read months of chart notes in an hour and was told it was a “learning opportunity.” When the resident and I would ask basic clarifying questions like “Did you see this patient?” (in regards to the change in their condition) he’d get defensive and act like we were accusing him of something. I feel like I’m going crazy trying to function in these conditions.

**Step Exams:** I delayed Step 1 because I wasn’t ready — emotionally, academically, anything. That delay ate into my Step 2 study time. I pushed Step 2 to late June and now have to study during my AI. Everyone else seems to be on vacation. Or matching at their dream places. Or already applying. I’m still scrambling just to feel caught up. I’ve done UWorld, NBMEs, etc. — but every day feels like I’m just trying to survive. I have no idea where my weaknesses are because the stress fogs everything.

**T**his is not even including what has been going on in my family life. I don’t know why this keeps happening. I try hard. I care deeply about patients. I show up early. I study. I ask for feedback. I try to be kind. But at this point I just feel defeated. This whole experience feels like one long trial. And I’m tired of proving that I belong.

If you’ve made it this far — thank you. I don’t know what I need. Encouragement? Advice? Just to know I’m not alone? To hear it gets better? I’m open to anything. It just feels like the people who were supposed to look out for me either didn’t… or couldn’t.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1kz00ge/feels_like_im_failing_on_all_fronts/

The 9:30 class was like talking to zombies.  They were reluctant to speak, struggled to follow, and almost every single student was tangibly exhausted during every class.  Many routinely arrived late as well.

The 3:30 section was the complete opposite - every student was sharp, engaged, talkative, and very quick with the material.  They even seemed happy to be there - they genuinely seemed to enjoy the experience.

I've never experienced anything like this before.  I've seen different classroom ""cultures"" emerge based on the personalities of the students, etc., but this seemed different.

I want to make sure that the residents and doctors see that I’m interested and genuinely want to learn as much as possible (despite being absolutely exhausted).

1mag8v9,Terrified about moving away for college,"Hi everyone, I’m worried I’m making a big mistake by moving across the country (california to New York) for college. I never expected to go so far from home bc I always wanted to stay close to home for college, but I applied to a few out of state schools because they were veryyyy good schools. I ended up getting into one of them and committed just bc I could not turn down such a good school and I wasn’t too happy about the ones I got into in state. The past few months I have been absolutely TERRIFIED every single second of every day to move away from home. When I say terrified I mean that it consumes probably 85% of my thoughts throughout the day. I’m already an anxious person who is very close with my family and the thought of moving away has made me unbearably anxious. At first people were telling that it’s normal to feel nervous about moving away for college and that it’s necessary to move away to grow/be independent and that I’ll get used to it, but at this point I just feel like the level of anxiety that I’ve been feeling is not normal, and that it might actually be an indicator that this is just not right for me. At this point if I don’t go, my only option is community college which is not ideal for me either. I know I can always transfer, but I am not too stoked about the idea of wasting the tremendous amount of money that this school is asking for just to end up transferring out. I just need some guidance. I’ve never been more mentally exhausted and directionless. I truly have no idea what to do ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mag8v9/terrified_about_moving_away_for_college/
1m5nwqp,"UK: passed with ‘minors’: supervisor thinks is molehill, feels like a mountain.","Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Had my PhD (UK, policy analysis) viva last week. It’s been a rough ride, partly as I ended up working right at the edge of my supervisors expertise. 

Viva generally a pleasant experience. My external (who is much closer to my area) was really complimentary about my work. But, they did not like my thesis structure at all. I have technically passed with minors, but they are at the big end of minors. I need to restructure two chapters, and rewrite part of my lit review and most of my discussion. 

My supervisor seems disappointed I am not very happy with this outcome. But the truth is I am exhausted. My project went wrong, I was ill, etc etc and so my funding ran out and I’ve spent the past year writing up while also doing full time work.  

The 8 weeks between submission and viva have been my best weeks for years. I have relaxed. I have exercised. I have been better at work as I actually take weekends off. I just had my Year 1 review and got a small bonus (whoop) but also some challenging targets for next year. 

I do not know how I will find the energy to go back to ‘the dark place’ and finish the PhD. I’ve come so far, I really don’t want to not finish. But I also don’t want to jeopardise a supportive, well paid job (aka my future) to finish off an unrewarding PhD (my dark and stormy past). 

I’ve tried to speak to others but everyone just says ‘focus on the pass’. But it’s a pass conditional on several months more work, and after several previous ‘one last pushes’ all of my thrusters are on empty. How can I manage to not fail at the last hurdle but also not totally break myself? ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1m5nwqp/uk_passed_with_minors_supervisor_thinks_is/

1mmn64d,"Feeling stuck after 5 months into my PhD, working full-time, no results yet, and a bit lost","Hi everyone,

A first year PhD studentm I started my PhD around March/April 2025, so it's been almost 5 months now. Honestly, I feel like I haven’t made any real progress. I’ve learned a lot and tried many things, but I haven’t found any meaningful results yet. Everything I try ends up being… kind of normal, not worth publishing or moving forward with.

Our PhD project is divided into three main parts. I’m currently working on the first part, and I’ve been stuck here for months now. My supervisor insists that I need to find a *good* result before moving on to the next stages. I suggested maybe we could settle for a “decent enough” result and move on just to keep things rolling, but he said no, that “the rest will come after we solve this part.”

Here’s the tricky part: I’m working a full-time job (40h/week), which takes up most of my energy and time. It’s a really good contract, so I don’t want to give it up, financially and career-wise, it’s very beneficial. But I also don’t want to quit my PhD. I genuinely want to make this work.

Because of the job, I barely find time to do proper research. I’m constantly feeling guilty, stressed, and like I’m falling behind. My supervisor has been on vacation and hasn’t responded to any of my messages for almost two months, so I feel very alone and unsure of what to do.

I just wanted to ask, has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice or perspective? I know 5 months isn’t a long time in the grand scheme of a PhD, but not seeing any real results yet is really draining. 

Please be kind I’m already mentally exhausted and just trying to figure things out.

zdskr8,My roommate is about to make me fail my exams,"I wish I was kidding about this title, and l'm someone who doesn't like shifting the blame to other people but l'm miserable.

These past few weeks she has been up practically all night on discord with her friends, which would be all well and fine, if she didn't laugh extremely loudly every 5 minutes. I've asked her to stop numerous times and she flat out ignores me every time. I've also had our RA talk to her to no avail.

I have severe insomnia, so I can't sleep with any sort of noise like that, and I don't have any earplugs or anything and she knows this. I also have bad ADHD, and can't do homework at night because I have absolutely 0 focus without my medication.

I haven't slept in 3 nights bc she has been being so loud and staying up all night. I could barely function today, and I had review for two exams that I fell asleep during bc I was so mentally and physically exhausted. Last week I got 3 hours max every night.

Not only that but l've lowkey been starving myself because I can't eat with her. I have SEVERE misophonia and can't deal with chewing sounds (another thing she knows) and she chews with her mouth open and SO LOUDLY every time.

The worst part of all of this is I've TALKED to her about this and she never understands. She doesn't leave me alone, except when I try to tell her about the problems I have.

I'm so miserable and don't know what to do. I really need to pass my exams to keep up my scholarship, but I have absolutely nothing I can do at night. Any advice is welcome, l'm truly desperate.

Edit: I appreciate everyone trying to help, but I thought I’d clarify more things.

1. My RA said there’s not much she can do until after the holidays, which is when the exams are over.
2. I would do homework in a common area, but my laptop only works on Ethernet (it’s not the best, and I can’t afford a new one at the moment)
3. It literally has been 3 days. It’s not an exaggeration. Last night was the first night she slept, and it was at 4am. She doesn’t have class til the afternoon, and doesn’t give a shit abt my schedule.
4. The school has been aware of my issues since the beginning, but since I don’t have severe anxiety, I couldn’t get a solo room. 
5. The food thing is confusing some people. When I tell you this girl gets so pissed at me if I’m eating with someone else, or at a different location, and it’s to the point that my therapist has said it’s bordering on emotional abuse.

Edit 2: I bought melatonin and earplugs. Melatonin usually doesn’t work for me, but I’m desperate. Thank you to everyone who suggested that!

Edit 3: she hasn’t left our room in a week except to eat (yes that includes her classes, she’s skipping all of them). I literally can’t avoid her when it comes to my room, and I’ve had to get alone time in other places. I also did eat today! I went to the town outside of campus and ate more than I’ve ever eaten in my life. I’m trying to avoid dining halls as much as I can. It truly is an issue, but I think that the finals stress is just making it so much worse.

1lo45dj,"No Real Interest in the Work, Just Chasing a Paper","**I’m exhausted. I carried a team project I didn’t even lead.**

I recently won a competition with a project idea I came up with. Our lecturer offered to submit it into a pre-accelerator program, and naturally, I said yes. We're four people in the team, but only two of us have been active throughout the program. One teammate never even attended a single session or contributed at all.

Here’s the kicker: I’m the only one without a PhD. I’m a postgraduate student. The rest of the team all have doctorates, and yet I ended up doing 90% of the work. I scheduled meetings, managed tasks, and kept things moving so we’d have something to submit. I basically led the project without being the lead or being treated like one.

I don’t want to sound bossy. I’m not even the team lead. But I stepped up because I cared about the work and wanted to make sure it actually progressed. And yes, all of us are equally credited in this program — regardless of who actually did the work. I’ve made peace with that, as long as I’m acknowledged too.

What’s been even more frustrating is that they don’t seem interested in doing what’s actually needed to complete the project. All they care about is publishing a paper from it, and to be honest, I don’t even want to be part of that. I didn’t join this program to chase academic papers. I joined to build something real. And frankly, it feels like they’re trying to publish just for the sake of publishing — without any real interest in the context, purpose, or impact of the study, or genuine concern for the people we’re serving and studying.

The tipping point for me was today. I had a hospital appointment and asked the team to cover something. One person didn’t follow through, didn’t check in, and showed zero concern for my wellbeing. It made me realize how self-serving he is. And just to follow up from me on something, this isn’t even about expecting sympathy. It’s about basic respect and responsibility in a team.

I’ve worked hard to build a career where I have a choice about who I work with, and I don’t want to keep working with people like this.

I used to dream of doing a PhD. I wanted to specialize and share knowledge with the world. But after this experience, I’m seriously reconsidering. Right now, I just want to finish the program, step away, and let them have all the IP. I don’t care anymore. I just want peace.

asszna,Grad students have to listen to our bodies during times of stress because our minds are too busy to realize we're stressed out,"Hey everyone,

So, I don't know if others can relate, but I find that because 1) PhD program's demand that you constantly be producing and working and 2) it is often the case that very ""go-go-go"" people are attracted to/ excel within academia, it is easy to not register when you are stressed out.

Within academia, I think the line between enjoying your work and over-working yourself is thin and that, as a result, it is hard to identify when you start pushing yourself too far, which is only magnified by the fact that, because we are constantly spending so much of our emotional and intellectual energy on our work, we tend to forget to check in with ourselves.

Something I have realized (I am currently in my 3rd year of my PhD program after doing a 2 year Masters) is that my body will tell me that I am stressed out long before my mind will start to register it, and that paying attention to your body and the signs it gives you in regards to being stressed is key to promoting your mental health within academia.

I feel like these “signs” vary from person to person, but for me, they are often:

1. Troubles sleeping - either insomnia, particularly even after taking sleeping pills, or waking up throughout the night. 

2. Having achy and sore muscles – this is typically more than the usual back/trap pain and elbow/wrist pain associated with extensive laptop use. For example, my legs get very lethargic when I am stressed, even after a good night sleep. 

3. Feeling abnormally warm – my body temperature is consistently higher. 

4. Feeling exhausted and lethargic during the day even after a good sleep

5. Heart palpitations that do not seem to be linked to anything 

6. Craving sugar or alcohol – not just liking or desiring these things, but legit craving them

7. Increased anxiety that typically is not socially motivated: for example, during high times of stress I am more likely to check to see if my oven is on before leaving the house even if I know it’s off, but personally, I do not feel more anxious around other people (I am also more of an extravert).

8. Increased irritability 

9. Changes in appetite – a few years ago, my appetite went up when I was stressed, but now it decreases. However, in general, I will engage in more “emotional” eating when stressed.

Edit. 10. Sometimes my left eye will twitch. 

Can you all relate? Are there any physical signs that you experience that signal to you that you may be stressed even when your mind doesn’t register it?

1hijbt2,Absolutely depressed about my performance and result in the first year,"Hello,

A year ago, I miraculously secured a PhD position that no one I personally know had been able to get. It felt like I was on top of the world, especially after enduring years of extreme poverty and social isolation while living abroad for my master’s degree. My resilience had finally paid off. For context, I come from a very poor country, which made this achievement even more significant for me.

When I arrived in Germany to start the position, I was ecstatic. However, from the very first day, I started experiencing negative intrusive thoughts. These ranged from: ""If I lose this opportunity, I’ll never forgive myself,"" to ""You’re just not qualified,"" ""You’re completely alone and won’t make it,"" ""Something out of your control will go wrong, so why bother?"" and ""Your analysis won’t produce statistically significant results anyway."" For background, I already take medication for major depressive disorder.

Now that the first year has ended, I feel deeply disappointed. It feels like I’ve accomplished nothing at all. Worse, I’m constantly bracing myself for an email saying I’ve been fired—even though they’ve never fired anyone in the past and no one there has even criticized my performance. Still, I couldn't get any peace of mind. 

I’ve also messed up any personal interactions—whether friendships, dating, or therapy—because I feel like it’s pointless to approach others when work isn’t going well. My reasoning is that if I lose my job, I might have to relocate anyway. I started looking for therapy in the last couple of months, but I couldn't even find that as all therapists tell me there are no appointments. 

Despite all this, I’m still absolutely determined to fight for my goals, but living this way is unbearable. My physical health is suffering—I’m losing hair, my face looks exhausted all day long, and I feel deeply unhappy. I’m currently on vacation, but I’ve spent most of it unable to get out of bed. Did nothing basically. 

If any of you have been in a similar situation, I’d appreciate your advice on how to move forward. I truly hope things can improve soon.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hijbt2/absolutely_depressed_about_my_performance_and/
1mpji38,"Advice Needed: Committee member has not given feedback until the last possible moment, potentially breaching professional ethics","I will keep this as brief as possible. Thank you in advance for clicking on my post. Any advice or recommendations are highly appreciated.

My PhD has been a living hell, and when I thought I was done, things could not get any worse; they got worse. My PhD is in a STEM field, and I have been working on it for three years now. For context, I have my advisor from my university, and one of my committee members, whom I will call ""Jim"", was essentially my boss and in charge of my research. Jim is the worst possible kind of academic in every conceivable way. He has no interest in pushing science forward and only likes safe, reliable research that can guarantee the results match his hypothesis and previous findings, as Jim only cares about the accolades and status. Every other scientist and researcher at the lab refused to work with Jim because everyone knew he was toxic. Jim has even encouraged me to fabricate results to make them better fit his expectations. When I refused, I was forced to redo the experiment until the results matched, which they never did. I've brought up these issues with my advisor multiple times. Still, nothing has changed, likely because my advisor previously worked with Jim.

My research focus has changed multiple times against my will. Due to government layoffs, my research was cut short, and I had to move back to my university. My defense date and all associated deadlines were moved up by six months (not my idea). This required me to compile all of my research and write the remaining 75% of my dissertation, plus conduct research and write an additional chapter/article in less than three months. Still, I met every deadline and successfully defended over a month ago. I received some pretty scathing but valid comments on my writing and figures. I followed all the edits and sent out updated drafts with details about the edits made nearly every other day until my committee requested I stop until I provide the final version. I sent out my ""final"" draft two weeks ago and finally got some feedback today. According to my advisor, four out of the five committee members are ready to sign and submit to the school; however, one member, Jim, has finally given his feedback. The edits he is requiring are substantial revisions to my entire document, including rewriting my entire introduction/literature review. The edits required can be done in a week if I work non-stop for 12+ hours a day and work through the weekend. However, even if I pull that off, the absolute last possible day that we can submit this to the university is next week. After reading the comments and puking up my breakfast, I spoke with my advisor, and he essentially told me to get started and that he'll talk with Jim, because that has helped so much in the past. My advisor has already had to request multiple extensions. If we don't submit by next week, I will have to enroll for another semester.

I can't do this anymore on every single level. The funding I receive from my university doesn't even cover the rent for my apartment, and I've exhausted my savings account, leaving me flat broke in likely a month. I've already started doing job interviews, and I doubt they will keep a position open for me. I need a backup plan in the event that my advisor can't change Jim's mind and my committee agrees the edits are necessary. At what point is Jim guilty of academic misconduct or breaching professional ethics? I can only assume that Jim has not read my writing until his ass is on the line, he's trying to screw me over, or both. Jim and the rest of my committee had to sign multiple forms saying they had read through my writing, had comments prepared, and that I was ready to defend. I've read through previous posts with similar topics, and I'm afraid to contact the grad office or speak with the dean of my department because I have no idea what can of worms that will open up. I'd like to believe that things will turn out for the best, but if doing a PhD has taught me anything, it's that it never happens.

Thank you for any guidance in advance. And to any other PhD students out there, your feelings are always valid; we'll all get through this together.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mpji38/advice_needed_committee_member_has_not_given/
fg67ve,"[Serious] I SOAPed, And You Can Too!","##PSA: DON'T ASK M4S IF THEY MATCHED

&nbsp;

Hello everyone. 

I know, I know, you have excellent board scores & letters of recommendations, you interview very well, or you’re applying to an “easy” specialty. But SOAP can happen to you (too)! I don't want to freak you out (I know I am), but the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) is something that a small percentage of medical students must go through every year. You need to know how it works. 43,000 medical students went through The Match last year. There were 1,700 unfilled spots for SOAPing. What happens if you are one of them? I went through the process last year & wanted to give some information & tips about going through the process. I am going to sprinkle in some of my experiences as we go on this journey. I’m no longer in the field I applied to & that’s okay.

&nbsp;

*—Note—*
>*The sentences that are different colors are links to relevant information. That may not always be obvious if you don’t have RES or are on mobile.*

&nbsp;

---
###SOAP, SOAP, WHAT IS SOAP!?

SOAP, or Supplemental Offer & Acceptance Program, is the opportunity (lol) to re-apply for unfilled residency positions the week of Match Week. The Match runs its algorithm & does quality control after submitting your Rank List officially. Once it figured out who is going where, there are both leftover applicants & residency spots. If you SOAP, you re-apply to available programs across remaining specialties & they offer you a spot in return. 

&nbsp;

---
###TO SOAP OR NOT TO SOAP

Before you start following through with SOAP, you REALLY need to think about your goals. Would you be happy doing internal/family medicine or general surgery the rest of your life? Should you apply but secretly plan to transfer for your PGY-2 year, either into the same specialty your originally attempted or a different specialty entirely? Should you take a research year & is that even feasible? Should you suck it up & accept whatever you get?

&nbsp;

I did not get a lot of information here & was woefully unprepared. Truly, I think I could've tried to do a research year & reapply, but my Dean pushed me hard to apply & take *whatever* I could get. A sneaking suspicion I have after the fact is that s/he didn't want to affect my medical school's Match rate. Regardless, this is a tough choice & the safest choice is likely to just apply & treat this as your last chance to Match. 

&nbsp;

Would you rather SOAP than match at some of the places you interviewed at? Fast rule: NOT WORTH IT. SOAPing is one of the worst experiences one can go through. If you applying to a large specialty with many SOAP spots, then maybe it is worth it. Check the link below to see what programs tend to be left for the SOAP before making this decision & then realize that you’ll be pitted against every applicant from your specialty who failed to match plus others jumping ship from their prior (this is specialty-dependent). Ask yourself this, would you rather not match this year or go to a program you don’t like? 

&nbsp;

LOOK AT YOUR SPECIALTY’S SOAP DATA NOW.  [I linked it right here (click this sentence)](https://bsolomon.us/app/residency-match/). Shout out to/u/anotherep for making this. It is otherwise VERY difficult to get useful information. 

&nbsp;

If you don’t match, will there only be no spots, 10 spots for hundreds of applicants, or plenty to go around?  NEXT look at your your back-up specialties. This will put this whole process in proper context.

&nbsp;

---
###THE BASICS

You have 45 applications you can use or void throughout SOAP. You have 4 days to use them. You need to apply & assign your application, letters of recommendations (LORs), board scores, etc. to these programs. Programs will contact you over the next 4 days for interviews. You may be offered a spot over 3 separate rounds, with fewer spots available as each round pass. If you do not match, the leftover spots are made available for you to apply to. 

&nbsp;

---
###PREPARE YOUR MIND

This is like waiting for interview invites on steroids. It will be grueling. Do not hold back anything. You will be delirious. You be sleep-deprived. You will cry. You will question decisions you made in the 4th grade. This will legitimately take time off your life. Just look at the Reddit SOAP threads from the last 2 years to see the chaos [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/) & [2]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/).

###*-SOAP DAY 1-* Monday, March 16th, 2020 (03/16/2020) I update these every year for you, my loved children

####10:30am ET: 
Your medical school learns whether you matched or not & begins game planning. 

&nbsp;

####11:00am ET: 
[""Did You Match?"" email is sent out](https://imgur.com/a/gRw72se). This tells you, well, whether you Matched or need to enter SOAP. It may take 5-10 minutes to get the email. I actually got mine 1 minute early. Refresh that sucker like your life depends on it, because it really kind of does... The crazy thing is, you do not have much time before you have to be finished shotgun applying to up to 45 programs by 3:00pm ET, so don’t dilly-dally!

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I was table rounding in a psych ward when I got the email. I refreshed it over & over. It had to be a mistake. I waited as patiently as I could for my attending to stop discussing the patient (1-2 minutes) & told her I had to leave because I didn’t match. I tried to exit the ward, but it’s a psych ward, so I had to wait another minute for a slow nurse to come unlock the door. I applied psychiatry by the way, so the irony was not lost on me.*

&nbsp;

The **List of Unfilled Programs** is available for you to look at. It is basically a list of the number of available residency spots at each unfilled residency in each specialty in alphabetical order. Print this out & trash the pages with specialties you aren’t re-applying for. This is a LONG document & it is easy to misplace pages you NEED. Highlight all the programs you are re-applying to. 

&nbsp;

There is not a lot of time between when you find out & can begin applying (1 hour). Programs won’t see applications for 4 hours, but they may see how quickly you applied relative to others, who knows. Get it done as soon as you can. Time goes fast from here on out.

>*My good friends met me in the medical school to help me out. Besides having to do the walk-of-shame, my room was next to the other medical students who volunteered to help us SOAPers. No one came to my aid from their group, but rather I had to listen to them pontificate on who didn’t match & why they thought so. Thanks, guys!*

##TIPS:


1) Use **all** 45 applications now. 

* It may benefit you to save some, but it’s unlikely. You can continue to apply until after Round 2. Essentially you would have the luxury (?) of seeing which programs don’t fill & then apply to them, but I can’t really see how this would benefit you & think it would put you at an immediate disadvantage compared to those who applied earlier. 


2) Use your friends & volunteer classmates (lol) for the following: 

* Re-hashing your **personal statements** for major problems & tailoring it to your potential new specialties. Other eyes help give you a new perspective, but most importantly, save you time. 
* Looking up **residency locations**. You will not know what or where Madisonville, Kentucky is. Go to Google maps & look to see how close these programs are to major cities if that's what you want. You will be almost blindly choosing residencies, & the choices seldom be great.
* Bring you **carbs & electrolytes**. You need energy now more than ever. Your body has never known this level of fear before & will be working overboard. 


3) Use your Dean/Bigwig helps you for the following:

* Practice phone interviews & look for major flaws. Maybe you are on the spectrum & didn't realize. Maybe you came off as smug when you thought you were confident. I don't know. You don't know. Maybe none of the above. It'll help to have an honest, outside perspective, if not only to reassure you that you’re normal. 


4) Use your home PD for the following:

* Email/call them for feedback. I mean, I was pissed at my PD for not accepting me, but it's worth finding out if they have any useful feedback. My feedback was useless, but perhaps you'll be luckier.
 

5) Use your Letter of Recs (LORs), Dean/Bigwig, & PD for the following:

* Ask them to call/email on your behalf to open residency programs AFTER they’ve contacted you. You all are not allowed to contact programs without them first contacting you, but use your Dean's/Bigwig's judgment on this. Mine may have pulled some strings for me (didn’t matter though, lol).

6) Tell your close friends & get off social media. 

* I sent a generic text to my closest groups of friends, especially those who knew it was Match week, telling them I didn’t match & would be missing-in-action for the next couple of days. I updated my absolute closest friends & family nightly before bed. Dealer’s choice here.
* I did use these Reddit [SOAP thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/) & [SOAP thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/) because some good information was out there. It was an extremely supportive community with nonexistent/minimal trolling. If you troll SOAPers there is a special place in hell for you.

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I had to pull my PD's teeth to get him to provide any help, so it probably didn't help much. Fortunately, my LORs were more-than-willing to call on my behalf. The PD-to-be commented that my LOR advocated heavily for me & I think this helped programs know I was serious about my new specialty choice. That is not something that is easy to convince interviewers & I was even between those 2 specialties for years & chose almost on a whim in the end.*

&nbsp;

####12:00pm ET: 
You can begin submitting your documents & applying to unfilled residencies on ERAS. Be sure you have attached all of the documentation to each & every program. You have to redo it all. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I was late resubmitting my Step 2 scores because of this oversight. Scared the hell out of me. Don’t be me.*


####3:00pm ET: 
Unfilled residencies begin reviewing SOAP applications. 

&nbsp;

####From 3:00pm ET to 11:00pm ET: 
Do not expect calls early on, but it can happen. At earliest around dinner, if not tomorrow morning. Be dressed up from the waist up for potential Skype interviews. Be wary of **time zones**. I considered myself on the clock until about 10pm ET. Cry & talk to who you need to early in the day. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*I was interrupted in the midst of crying to my significant other about how unfair life was when one of my top programs (albeit it was in family medicine) called me. Needless to say, it was a terrible interview & only made me feel worse the rest of the night. You don’t know how many calls you’ll get, so don’t allow yourself to blow it.*

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*My latest phone interview was the first night around 10:00pm or 11:00pm ET from a central time zone program, & I was the 2nd applicant they called! I was about to turn in when I got the call. Try to find a hobby you can do to take your mind off of things & keep you busy. I got really good at guitar again during SOAP.*

&nbsp;

##INTERVIEW INFORMATION:


1) These calls often happen without warning:

* Some programs email you via ERAS or have their program coordinator contact you to set up interviews. 
* I found that the majority were cold calls, at least until aPD &/or PD meetings were scheduled.


2) Residents screen you: 

* Lots of programs had 2 upper year residents call first before having me speak with the aPD &/or PD. Some feel like they’re recruiting you. 
* If they schedule interviews for a later time, try to take the soonest times you can. People remember the first & last things on lists.


&nbsp;

---
##INTERVIEW TIPS:

1) Lie. 

* Seriously, lie. If they ask whether you will transfer out after your first year, the answer is resoundingly NO. Find out reasons for them to believe you. Tell Madisonville, Kentucky you love incest if you must. 
* If they ask you whether you'll accept their offer (this happened to me), you say YES. You do NOT say no under any circumstance. YOU DO NOT SAY NO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. **YOU DO NOT SAY NO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.** 
* Honesty was my policy during interviews pre-SOAP & I was deceived by PDs. **They are rats. We are rats.** Play the game & Match. Nothing else matters.

2) Tell programs that you will 100% accept their offer

* Do not hesitate to say yes. In fact, emphatically say yes. 
* Programs will be wary, especially if you’re applying to a new specialty. I had programs basically straight up ask me how serious I was & whether I would accept their offer. I wrote a LOI to a program I had 0 desire to go to (my dean forced my hand, didn’t get the offer anyway). 
* You don’t have to write LOIs for every program. I only wrote it because the program was basically asking me to. I recommend post-interview communication with all interviewers though. 


3) Do NOT tell programs if other programs have promised you a spot.

* If a program says they are going to offer you a spot, first of all, do NOT believe them. It really doesn’t even make sense for them to do that if they weren’t, but it could prevent you from completing your interviews or subconsciously changing how you behave in other interviews. 

&nbsp;

*—Interlude—*
>*Some poor soul told some program coordinator, that s/he was already promised an offer so the residency didn’t need to interview with them anymore. This bitch then emailed the SOAP specialist asking whether it was allowed. Spoiler, it’s not, & she knew that!! [This applicant may have been slapped with a Match violation & lost his spot](https://imgur.com/a/iKLUA31). So…fuck you Brittany!*

&nbsp;

4) Research your top choices. 

* Your top choices are probably everyone’s top choices. Make sure you know them well. 
* Consider having your computer with you during phone interviews & do research mid-interview, but beware this can backfire as this is not easy to do. 


5) Dress up from the waist up. 

* Shower & wash your hair. Wear sweats underneath. You'll feel more human & will look better. RIP to your eyelid lower motor neurons this week.


6) Why didn’t you match? 

* You will get this question from serious programs. Have an answer, or at least brain-storm with them about reasons. Make something up if need be. Ask them why they didn’t match as well. 


7) Why did you apply here? 

* I found that the majority asked. Realistically, the answer is oftentimes LOCATION, which I think is an alright answer unless you were lucky enough to review 45 programs in detail. They know this, but they also will assume you weren't as serious if you don't have a good answer. 


8) What would you do in *x* situation? 

* I got more behavioral questions in one SOAP interview than my entire interview season. Not sure if it’s specialty-related (this was for family medicine) or SOAP-related. 


9) Do not rush interviews to answer incoming calls. 

* This sucks. Nothing you can do. Might not even happen. Do not try to rush your interview, even if you see it is from a city you are interested in. 1) The person calling may just have that area code. 2) You may not get that spot anyway, so don't burn bridges. Any missed call I had I was able to make up at a later time. 

&nbsp;

---
##POST-INTERVIEW COMMUNICATIONS:


1) Do it.

* Take no chances. Find all of their emails if you can. Ask the program coordinator if need be. I sent them to everyone with varying responses (mostly silence). Leave no stone unturned. You will be exhausted by this point, but you cannot stop pushing yourself to the finish line. 
* [Here are how many emails I sent out](https://imgur.com/a/4kBpFpI). Note how many have no replies. Note the interview survey request from pre-SOAP interviews that was requested of me. 


###*-SOAP DAY 2-* Tuesday, March 17th, 2020 (03/17/2020)

####6:00am ET: 
Get up & get dressed. Though it's unlikely you'll get a call very early, don't chance it. You won't be able to sleep anyway. 

&nbsp;

####11:30am ET: 
Programs can begin their rank list. I don't think this really means anything. 

&nbsp;

####11:30am to 11:00pm ET: 
Continue what you started the day before. Hopefully you have your aPD &/or PD calls today. [This day was very busy for me](https://imgur.com/a/HGFVSrV). May not be busy for you, & it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

####12:00pm ET: 
SOAP offer round 1 starts. You receive all (if any) offers at this time. You must accept or decline your offers. You have 2 hours to respond. Once this is done, it is finalized. Don't click the wrong button.

&nbsp;

####2:05pm ET: 
List of unfilled programs is updated. Time to find out who betrayed you.

####9:00am ET: 
SOAP offer round 3 starts. Same as above. If you got nothing, wait until 12:00pm ET & find out what's left. 

&nbsp;

####11:00am ET: 
SOAP ends. It's over. 

&nbsp;

####12:00pm ET: 
Post-SOAP List of Unfilled Programs updated to include all remaining unfilled programs (including those not participating in SOAP) & available to all unmatched & partially matched applicants regardless of SOAP eligibility. Hopefully this isn't you. Apparently it costs a boatload to apply from here on out. You can call programs directly & try to schedule interviews. Not an easy path. We had someone successfully do this after a couple of months at my medical school. I can’t offer any advice in this regard. You can check out [this recent (now old) post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aryuez/serious_so_you_didnt_matchnow_what/) by [USER] for advice.

###*-Match Day-* Friday, March 20th, 2020 (03/20/2020)

####1:00pm ET: 
Feign surprise. Unfortunately everyone knows. But you accomplished something they will never understand. No one else will understand what you just went through. This was one of the worst weeks of my life, but I came out. You can too.

&nbsp;

I’ll try to answer any questions you all have. I don’t want to give away who I am that easily, so it may have to be through PMs. These SOAP threads [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/83tzth/official_soap_thread/) & [2]( https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aztyra/official_soap_thread_rmedicalschool_2019_match/) were very helpful for me because everyone was supporting each other. Keep that trend going. Lie to **programs**, not to other applicants.

1gx8b60,Failing class,"I got so behind on my grading this semester, and now that I'm catching up, I find that one of my online classes is about 75% failing. My college harps on DWFI rates, and I'm nervous. I also have several students sending me emails begging for a chance to turn things in (most of the ones failing are due to not turning things in). I feel guilty because I haven't reached out to these students earlier to warn them, but shouldn't they have been keeping track of their assignments themselves (i.e., if you don't turn in assignments and the due dates have passed, you will fail)?

I am nervous about so many students failing my class, which has never happened to me before, but I really don't want to add the pressure of letting them make up assignments that I will have to spend extra time grading and feel like a softie. I keep reprimanding myself for getting behind on grading, but I've been having health issues and been exhausted.

All these years have upended my life. The advisor doesn’t want to spend time because this is pure academic research. Other lab members work on industrially funded projects, so they get all the attention and advising. It has been rough, trying to be independent. The advisor hasn’t spent the time to edit the manuscript that I submitted 10 times at this point, and now I gotta graduate because the advisor says so. Even if I asked what else I could do to get it edited, then I would receive vague responses at best. Or the advisor has changed their ideas so many times.  The advisor seems to want to push me out with a master's instead. I am so exhausted at this point. Also, the job market isn’t friendly, so I don’t even know what I’m doing.

1myhdru,Burned out and trying to study for step 2,"So this is really just to vent because this has been such a difficult time. I have been so exhausted since the end of my surgery rotation at the end of February. Since then I feel like I have been running on fumes. It's a struggle to get out of bed in the morning, I want to sleep all day, and I sometimes struggle to take care of my basic needs. Most days I have no interest in doing anything. I recently finished clerkships and it was such a hot mess. I had to retake a shelf and I just couldn't bring myself to put in any extra effort than what was necessary. Now I am studying for step 2 and it has been absolutely fucking demoralizing. And since failing that shelf, I have felt so awful about my test taking skills. I constantly second guess all my answers. I just don't have any confidence in myself anymore. Every day is such a struggle to get up and study. I feel like such an idiot lately. I've been so emotional too and crying quite often. I've just been struggling so much and step 2 is giving me so much anxiety. It's so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. That may be dramatic but that's genuinely how I feel.

I have a psychiatrist and I'm on max dose antidepressants. I'm currently looking for a therapist now too. I have a good support system here with my friends but I do feel kind of bad bringing up my problems to them all time. They are also in med and grad school and have their own stressors. I know this is just a hump I will have to get through, but I'm just so exhausted. Can anyone else relate?

1h6guu5,Any medical students know how to take care of yourself at the same time?,"Just finished my first semester of medical school. I usually sleep between 3am-6am, so pretty much get 4-5 hours of sleep a day and catch up on weekends. I eat junk, I always forget to drink water, and I get absolutely no exercise. I drink 1-2 energy drinks a day. I feel drained, sluggish, bloated, gross, and just overall exhausted every day. I don’t engage in extracurriculars, events, and socializing as much as I want to because of this. 

How do I balance my studies with working out, taking care of myself, and engaging my hobbies (reading, baking, socializing)?

Edit: I study efficiently, I just study pretty last minute. Like I’ll go 2-3 days without studying which is kinda a problem when you have an exam every week. And I also waste time on my phone doomscrolling I think out of anxiety or exhaustion. Because the labs like anatomy lab takes a lot out of me.

1ju2l35,Chronic illness + first year of medical school is destroying me.,"I'm currently an M1 on the brink of failing, and I'm just...done.  About a year before I started medical school, I began experiencing debilitating chronic fatigue, and it's been rough. I wake up exhausted, and this grinding fatigue just follows me throughout the entire day. I'm stuck with this constant brain fog, I sleep constantly, and my academic output has fallen off a cliff. I know what I used to be capable of, and I know what I'm able to do now, and the difference is stark. And so I've failed every test I've taken here.  

Every. Single. One.  

Hell, I can barely get through some conversations because I lose focus and can't keep track of everything that's being said. My school administration seems to be pretty understanding in that they're sitting down and talking to me about what's going on, having multiple meetings, advising me to take a leave of absence if medically necessary. And that gives me another layer of guilt, honestly, where it seems like I'm so much luckier than a lot of other med students in similar situations, and I'm still just burning through every chance I'm given.  

I have been trying to resolve this medically, I've seen numerous doctors, started medications, none of it's really helped much. They truly are trying though, they're looking at so many different possible etiologies, but it's just not shown much success.  I tried therapy about a month ago, and when I mentioned failing every exam, I got hit with the ""Wow. I didn't even know you could do that"". So therapy was a bust.  

God, it just feels so unfair. It feels unfair that I just got this random condition on top of medical school and I just have to deal with it.  I'm surprised at how quickly my mental health has declined from it. I suppose part of it is how much of my identity I staked on my ability to derive academic success from hard work. I went from frustration to resigned acceptance to passive and then active suicidal ideation in about a 15 months. 

I've put my last stop as my recent exam score. I took it recently and I'm waiting for results to come out soon. If I pass I'll try to fight through it and hopefully get back on track. If I fail, I’m just going to give up. I'm just... I'm done. I am done. I was done 3 months ago. I don't have anything left. I don't have the strength to keep failing over and over and over again. I don't have the strength to go back and tell my friends/family the extent of the damage I've caused and to try to start my life over. I don't have the strength to suffer through this anymore. I just don't.

I’m not excited about working and I generally have a math profile, so doing an applied math PhD makes sense maybe, but I don’t know if I’m in the right headspace to go to grad school right now, especially because I don’t think I would have the discipline to make it in academia afterwards and the opportunity cost for work would be high. I’m also an engineering major and I kind of decided over the summer that I would just do new grad hiring and work for a year after I graduate and apply next cycle if I don’t really like my job, but my math advisor just told me that I should apply this cycle bc otherwise grad schools will think really negatively about my lack of commitment (which is probably a valid concern lol).

I have a 4.0 with some grad math classes, some math research experience / a math REU and I think my letters of rec wouldn’t be horrible, but my personal statements would be pretty bad given I haven’t researched any programs and everything’s due in like November and December. 

I don’t want to commit to the wrong thing or miss important windows, but I’m exhausted and I don’t know if I have the energy to grind applications. The big thing is I don’t know if I like math enough to keep going with it, and I don’t know what I will do afterwards, and that combined with the short time window makes this feel non ideal.

I can get a little bit done during these times, but I can tell my anki progress is not the best during it. 

I always plan on studying for a while when I get off, but I'm having trouble. I'm too exhausted from the day to jump straight into studying and I'm too nervous about studying and everything else to fully relax. 

I know this is a weird situation in which its pretty much just up to me to buckle up and force myself to study, but any advice would be really appreciated. ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mqhtk3/how_to_relax_and_study_at_home_after_clinicals/

11opmrm,"My advisor told my entire lab group about my pregnancy without asking me, and I'm worried he's told my committee and I just feel icky about it","I'm a 3rd year M.S. student in a natural science, so it's pretty typical to be fully funded until your defense but my advisor has been difficult and has not paid me since last summer. On top of that, I got pregnant in the fall (planned) assuming he'd be responsive with feedback and I'd be able to finish my thesis by December. Turns out he was not responsive, so here I am in the spring semester and pregnant enough that I had to tell him partly out of courtesy (so he doesn't hear it from someone else) and partly to try and urge him to provide the feedback he's obligated to provide as an advisor... When I told him I was pregnant, he did not say 'congratulations', he said ""Ok"" and that was it. I found out this week that he told the rest of my lab group without asking me if I was ok with him telling people (which I think is illegal...). It might be different if I still had lab or field work obligations and needed to take precautions but I am quite far removed from that now and just writing, so it was totally unnecessary for them to know (and I'd have rather told them myself). Because I am trying to finish my thesis and defense before the baby arrives, I think my advisor has decided to blame the pregnancy on my delays (rather than his lack of feedback and guidance, or, you know, me not being paid in a year and him telling me not to get a job) and I'm worried he has also told my committee (and they REALLY have no need to know unless I decided to tell them myself). Overall I just feel icky about it and don't know if I'm overreacting or if it's really not ok. What would you do if this were you? He has made many borderline sexist comments (more along the lines of implicit bias, so not like flaming sexism but still not ok) in my time working with him so I'm just frustrated and exhausted.

1mk57xa,My partner doesn't respect academia,"I've struggled with some things that my partner has been saying since starting my PhD. 

It doesn't really matter what it is, but when I talk about academia or colleagues, he doesn't seem to have much respect for it as someone who grew up working class.

Just as an example, I was having a little rant today about how academia doesn't always suit people wanting a family, setting up a home, or generally needing some stability due to the nature of someone needing to commit to finding competitive, temporary, fixed-term positions for years until they're experienced enough for a professorship, and he goes ""Well that's what plumbers and carpenters do all the time, you academics just think a lot of yourself"". The same happens when I say I'm stressed, or working a lot, it'll be a comment (albeit, meant to be a jokey one) about how I 'don't have a real job' and the conversation is shut down. 

I know academia works for privileged people, I know I'm privileged to be funded to do my research, and I know a lot of struggles aren't unique to academia, but sometimes I just want him to be proud of me and respect what I do - and come on, I just want to be able to vent about something! 

Just to add: I am not from a well-off family and have no financial support outside of my funding and part-time work, so it's not a jab at me, although it often feels like it. I also go to a very well-off, fancy university, so that doesn't help. 

Does anyone have any experience with this attitude to academia, either from family, friends or partners? I don't really know how to navigate it; it upsets me, but I also do understand why he struggles with the class differences.

1in6ep5,Made the mistake of marrying another academic…,"Met my husband in high school. Great man, my best friend. His research is completely unfundable, he has never applied for or gotten a grant, and he wants to be a teaching professor. In his defense, he is an excellent professor; the undergrads give him great reviews and he loves teaching.

We lived apart for undergrad, moved in together when he started his PhD, got a dog; I worked full time to make sure we could afford to do his PhD.  Then, in his last year, I started my PhD about a thousand miles away, with the idea that he would be able to get a job here when he defended. He hasn’t gotten a single interview within 5 hours of my university in the last three years (he’s been a VAP in New England, still about 1000 miles away). Actually, he has gotten about five interviews total in the last three years— one offer he declined to take his current position, and another interview that went with a different candidate; one job that stopped their search because of funding issues (last year) and now this interview. His field sucks. (No offense) It really seems like being a teaching professor isn’t physically possible as a job anymore.

So he’s on the market for jobs for the third year in a row (his VAP is up); he’s not a productive researcher and prefers teaching, like I said. his only interview is in Boston. He’s super qualified for the job; he’s a great teacher, etc. This will likely be the job he takes (as we have 0 other options).

I’m still in grad school, a thousand miles away. My area’s COL is significantly lower, so I have our dog despite being the one that makes less money— because we can afford a good enough one bedroom apartment that allows him and has outdoor space for him to run/places to walk him. I digress.

Even if I can work remotely on my dissertation and/or magically find a postdoc in Boston after I finish (my research is more fundable/my lab is more productive)— a 1 bedroom is ~2.5-3.5k, and you need four months of rent to get an apartment. A house in the suburbs (if we wanted to commute an hour by train or in traffic) is, minimum, $600k. It’s just not feasible on one (or two) postdoc salar(ies). We can’t afford to have a one bedroom or a house that allows a dog! 

It seems like my husband is going to have to have roommates and/or live in a basement studio apartment again (which is not conducive to a 100 pound dog).

I love my husband. I want to have a family with him (so, realistically, we need to have kids in the next ten years if it’s going to happen at all.) I don’t want to spend the next 15 years of our relationship like the last 15 (where we only got to live together for 3 years). but the logistics are not logistic-ing and I’m (continuing to feel) more hopeless every day.

Does anyone figure this out? I realize this is a first world problem because at least we can find a place with roommates and/or a mostly inhabitable place (his current New England apartment (which costs the same as mine in rent, despite being significantly worse) has pests, barely working heat, the fridge in the living room/bedroom area and no microwave, dishwasher, or laundry… so his standards are already low) but it feels like we should be able to do more than barely scrape by, as highly educated 30-somethings… I’m a first gen college student, so maybe my expectations of education=upward mobility were unrealistic.

Edit: 

I appreciate all of your problem solving! I mostly wanted to scream into the void but it appears this is a very relatable issue (for academics in relationships but also for pure math phds, who feel the pain). I’d encourage anyone that is looking for a career change to look at the comments; there are many good suggestions.

Categories of suggestions so far: 

—he should change his career (to another field of research; quant/the NSA/industry programming; teaching at another level or adjuncting)

—I need to drop out/find another career and follow him to where he is 

—I should talk to him about how I’m stressed (I do. He’s stressed too.)

—I need to go fuck myself (thanks guys)

FAQ:

—yes, these are first world problems. I grew up poor; my stipend is more than my parents made when I was a kid. I spent years in college with just the clothes on my back and what I could carry, and had to drop out to work so I could finish school. My husband didn’t grow up poor, but he saw how it influenced me, and has helped me out literally hundreds of times since we were 15.

—I was being facetious in saying marrying him was a mistake, lol. Academics are going to marry other academics. I have a great relationship with my husband and I’m not going to divorce him. I think he would be a stay at home dog dad before divorcing me as well. This is more of an us-vs-the greater Boston area problem.

—He’s a great guy and I didn’t mention even 1/4 of the things he is great at in his job. 

—He has an intense hatred of networking and building relationships for the purpose of getting a job, which gets in the way (this is my entire culture so I don’t get it but okay). He wants to be hired the way he got into college and grad school— based on the merits of his application— instead of cheating or taking advantage of people (which is how he sees networking/cold emailing). And, the things he is great at in his job (despite being important FOR THE JOB) are not the things valued by the capitalist hellhole that is the American university system… I will digress.

—he has a very intimate understanding of my stress and anxieties and preferences; mostly I wanted to scream into the void about how horrible the academic system is for two people, and how shitty the real estate market is in the greater Boston area as compared to where I live now (I don’t think units even rent for $3k/month in my area). we’ve both had to move towards each other in expectations over the last fifteen years. 

—And, he does love our dog, even though he pretends to tolerate him; our dog was in our wedding, in our wedding vows. We got him the week we got engaged. He is a loved dog. if I died, he would take our dog in a heartbeat [and probably provide better care for him than I do], and he also wants to prioritize having a home where all three of us can be comfortable, and be able to have kids. It’s not as important as having a job he likes (which, makes logical sense) but it’s important.

(if you are having a hard time having conversations with your partner about this stuff, highly recommend seeing a marriage and family therapist. We do a little of it in my field (and I’ll sometimes pull those techniques for whole family sessions) but it’s very, very different from what I do on the daily. Some clinical psychologists, lcsws, lpcs, etc will have training and experience and preference in it, but the MFTs are the ones that will most consistently have training in it. May not be covered by insurance because of how the American health care system works (because psychological problems can ONLY be in one person /s)

It seems like my post might have accidentally reached beyond the world of academia, so I will also provide an academia FAQ:

— My husband has a job, don’t worry guys. He makes more than twice my stipend, and probably still will in his new position. It’s just not going to be enough to pay rent (2.5-3k per month????) and also save money for a down payment on the cheapest possible house within commuting distance in Boston (most houses on the commuter rail are ~$600k minimum and more like $750k). This feels completely absurd for two people that have doctorates to have as a problem (the thesis of my post).

—my degree is funded by doing research— it’s not med school, and I’m not living off my husband’s money; my stipend is more than enough to live on in the middle of nowhere with a large dog. My lab makes money for the university (grants) so they pay us well. 

— When you first get your PhD in most fields in the US, you have to (in most cases) take a temporary position that lasts for 1-2 years (either as a postdoc or as a visiting professor). That position is often renewable for one time, for one year, because universities know the job market sucks— so you apply for jobs when you graduate, and then after a year even though you have another potential year, and then after your second year (even though you have another potential year) and then finally if you don’t get anything, you HAVE to get a job because your current job *will not take you back* for another year. A real adult (actual tenured professor) will be able to explain what the funding mechanisms are that make this a thing. 

—The goal is to get either a tenure track job (which usually requires a track record of funding and publication, at least to some degree) or a teaching stream job (which is a tenure track teaching job). When we were kids, we both thought “you get your PhD and then you get a job as a professor!” No. You get your PhD and then you fight 300 other applicants for the same 30 positions. 

—Having permanent professors is expensive for universities. Departments will often need more professors to teach classes and the university will not want to pay for them. Most universities are eliminating tenure track jobs and teaching stream jobs in favor of adjuncts and term-limited positions (like instructors or lecturers. Don’t ask me what the difference is).

—so, my guy is applying to jobs across the country, often hundreds per cycle, and getting a handful of interviews, for a number of reasons, but mostly because the career kind of sucks and he doesn’t have independent funding (from the NSF or, in my field, the NIH [RIP]. If you don’t bring your own funding, the university has to pay for you, and you can’t pay them that sweet sweet overhead money from your grant. they don’t want to do that. So being a good professor matters 2% in the grand scheme of the university wanting to have people that will bring them in more money.

—in my field, this is all complicated by having the ability to practice in a hospital. So, you do your PhD, you train to be a psychologist through classes and clinical work and supervision at the same time, and then in your last year of your PhD (ideally after you defend) you spend a year as an actual psychologist in a hospital. You have to do this to graduate with a PhD in clinical psychology. And then, you have the option to go into industry, postdoc, or clinical postdoc (spend another two years trying to get licensed). 
If you ever see a PhD psychologist at the hospital that doesn’t have an MD— this is likely what they did to get that job; about 8 years of post-bacc training at minimum. I digress.

—We’re more competitive licensed because we can teach at medical schools, provide clinical supervision and care, and also do research. But it takes more time. But also, then I can take any old hospital job. So, I have pretty good career prospects after I graduate, I’m just not sure how, if I make about as much money as he does, we will be able to afford to live in Boston long term.

1etj960,I think the PhD broke my ability to work,"I started a new job recently after finishing my PhD almost a year ago. I've noticed that whenever I'm trying to do work that is in any way challenging, I get the strong urge to abandon the effort and play chess (or eat junk food, or do some other dopamine-rich activity) instead. This pattern started during my PhD because I was highly stressed dealing with my supervisor, and my ego became somewhat fragile, which lead to me very often avoiding my research. I think my brain now sees anything difficult as a threat to my ego, whereas before I would've been more resilient to setbacks and unknowns.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm worried I won't be able to get enough work done and they'll fire me. And even beyond work, it feels like I'm struggling to do the things I want in life because of this anxiety around failure, which is depressing. Maybe I need to just go to therapy.

1m91xp7,Does anyone else admit academia is just a job and not their lofty ”calling”?,"I think work/life balance is important. My family and friends, they are my calling. Those are the people I live for, not this job and not these increasingly lazy and entitled kids. 

I don’t understand people who wax poetically that this profession is their lofty calling, that they were called to do this job. Part of me is certain they’re just virtue signaling because that’s what people/admins/students want to hear and these same people are also painfully vain with unnecessary superiority complexes.

I want to be clear: I enjoy my job as a university professor and I work incredibly hard at it; getting a PhD is never easy. We all know that. But this job is not my “calling”. 

Especially in this current day of Gen Z, we’re expected to bend over backwards 10x even more so than ever before dealing with all the AI headaches, overbearing admin, and everything else. We are not customer service reps.

I love my job and I’ve worked very hard to get my doctorate and be the veteran professor I am today, but it’s important to me personally that I remember: at the end of the day it’s still just a job. It’s just a job, people. Nothing else. Don’t let it eat you alive.

And I don’t hear a lot of people say that, at least not in my little ecosystem. It’s all lofty self-congratulatory praise for our profession, and it’s navel-gazing bullshit like this that makes those not in academia think we are all elitists when I know so many of us are not. Just wanted to rant a bit. Not sure if I’m the only one that feels this way. 🫤

Edit: the vast majority of people in the comments get what I’m saying, and I am truly grateful for your support but for the small percent that don’t they clearly didn’t read my post in full and they’re just projecting their own insecurities. Like I said before I love my job and this is just a rant and isn’t this whole sub about venting our frustrations in a safe place? No one else has ever felt stressed about this job?

Both his cell and office numbers.  No answer. We send emails. Nothing. Forty five minutes have passed. I’m freaking out. I need a full committee of four to pass me and sign off after I’ve completed my defense. 

Now, every department has THAT professor. You know the one.  Known for being a hard ass. Just a little bit smarter than everyone else and doesn’t want anyone to forget it. Dr. X was NOT that professor. But you know who was? Dr. ‘C.’ My advisor’s good friend. And the man he called a favor in to in order to have him substitute as the fourth member of my committee since Dr. X was a no-show. 

So I’m stressed out from Dr. X not showing up. And then extra stressed from Dr. C being the last-minute addition to my committee. I stutter my way through my presentation (that I gave flawlessly the week before as an Exit Seminar in front of the whole department.) I couldn’t tell you any of the questions I was asked about my work. I’ve blocked it all out. But I passed. 

This happened 10 years ago and I’m still mad at Dr. X. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1h5y9qw/committee_member_forgot_to_show_up_for_my_defense/

I can’t even describe the elation, guilt, and panic I feel about how well my defence went. They came in telling me there were no criticisms, only interest in my topic and questions regarding my own opinion.

I feel so incredibly lucky to have such a positive viva. And immense guilt that I had such a positive viva. 

If it makes anyone feel any better, I had a mock viva a week ago where I burst into tears because I was so stressed, and today I answered so well I obtained a near perfect thesis/viva result.

Not a brag, so much as “wtf, what a dream” for me. Best of luck to all doing their defence this week.

1ji7trm,Being poor is robbing me of post match happiness,"I match my #3. I was bummed it wasn't #1 but still was happy when finding out. However now I feel extremely stressed about money and moving. My med school friends are inviting me out to trips and parties that I just can't afford to go to. I can't go on ig anymore because I see my classmates traveling, partying, relaxing, etc. Don't get me started on the match day gifts (literally one girl is getting a house!). Meanwhile I'm budgeting out my last bits of loan money, looking for apartments, and possibly a part time job.

Not just me but my mom is sad too. It was already alot of money for my family to even come to my match day event and my mom feels bad she cant afford to give me a vacation or presents. I wanted to avoid this but she was there talking to other parents and heard me decline a group japan trip.

So yeah just feel a mixture of jealous, sadness, and stress. I should be on the beach eating fruit enjoying the outcome of all my hard work but sadly I can't. 

EDIT: Didn't expect my emotional rant to gain so much sympathy. Thank you to everyone for being kind and sharing their story it honest helped me. Put things into perspective. Rereading my rant I sound like a brat ngl. I am in a better spot than most people in the world. Is it the best? No. But it is FAR from worst. For this I'm so grateful.

13unxu1,"Selected random roommate at my desired dorm, roommate messaged me 2 days later telling me the spot was meant for their friend?","Hello, I'm entering my first year of university this coming Fall, and I was planning on living in a dorm for the year. The uni I'm at has a decent amount of dorm options, but I really wanted to go with the one in the center of campus, which was in high demand due to the location. On room selection day I was lucky enough to get one of the very last rooms available at my desired residence hall. I was matched with a random roommate and thought everything good to go until they messaged me the next day telling me to switch out because the spot in his dorm was meant for his friend.

By now, there are no other rooms available in that residence hall since it was in such high demand, meaning that if I gave up the spot I would have to go to one of the dorms at the edge of campus. I was really looking forward to living in my selected dorm because it's really close to all my classes and I'm almost fully legally blind, meaning biking / driving / skating around isn't an option for me and walking was a super convenient option from where I was (planning on) living. 

Now, though, it seems that I've been given the ultimatum of either being forced to move out to another dorm or live with someone who does not want to live with me. On the housing application sheet, there was a section meant to indicate whether or not you were planning on living with a selected roommate or a random roommate, and this person says something went wrong with their friend's application which is why they weren't automatically paired. I've contacted the university housing department (no response yet) and my assigned roommate is getting pushy about me choosing somewhere else to live. 

Does anyone know if there's anything I can do about this? I don't want to be forced to move out (there are very few open dorms left; my 2nd, 3rd and 4th choices are all filled up), but I also don't want to force someone to live with me who doesn't want to live with me. I'm really stressed out about the whole situation now and need help.

edit (minor update): Got involved with housing administration, they said they would handle it and there would be no problem. They haven't made any changes yet, but they said I would be able to stay at the same residence hall in a different room.

I almost completely missed out on the boom years. Now I gotta watch people more talented than me with degrees that aren't from a small shitty liberal arts college like mine lose their jobs left and right while I make $30 an hour, working QA, and watch new office drama unfold every other week.

m0894c,Going through med school poor was hard,"Not just med school, but all of life up to and including med school.

I have been financially independent since as long as I can remember, maybe middle school. My parents have never given me more than $20 total in my lifetime. I'm a woman and the bullying from having to wear my male cousins hand me down clothes was rough.

I've taken out loans for both tuition and living for undergrad and med school. Before med school, I paid for my grad degree by working full-time (was salaried and ended up being more like 70 hours per week).

I acquired a lot of chronic health issues from working so much and then doing grad school part-time.

Living loans barely cover the ""true"" cost of living, except I don't have anyone I can turn to in an emergency. I cannot ask my parents or siblings for financial help. I feel the stress of this daily.

For example, unexpected health bills. I have a ton of health bills currently in collections and my dad sends me a text message photo of the collections bills coming in. There's not anything that either of us can do about these bills though.

I worked full time for years just to be able to save up for MCAT and application fees, however my full-time research job paid peanuts and I was never able to save up any money.

So I took out a 10k loan to cover app costs (applied broadly MD and DO, including travel costs).

I don't quality for any URM or merit scholarships. I am proud of my grades, but they are quite average because I have a lot of paid side jobs which cut into my studying and overall stress level/quality of life.

I was excited to come across the #medgradwishlist trend on Twitter, I was hoping to find what I needed for residency free on local buy nothing groups but realized this could help supplement. But I then realized it's geared towards URM's, and I am white.

I absolutely realize the privilege I have with my skin color but I've just felt so lost in med school. I have a lot of friends but it's difficult to connect on more than a surface level with all of my wealthy classmates that come from double doctor families. People see my skin color and assume I am part of this group of students and I feel like we are from different planets.

And then the med school friends I do have end up dropping me when they realize that 1.) I'm too poor to have a car so I can't meet them at X place to hang out or 2.) I can't have our social events be weekly expensive takeout food, I just can't afford it.

I'll probably delete this later because it feels too vulnerable and I'd get stressed if there's any mean comments.

Idk, I'm graduating med school soon and there's no one I've been able to speak with about this before because there's no one at my school that has had a similar experience.

&#x200B;

*Edit: Thank you for seeing me. If your life experience has been similar, I see you too. I appreciate each and every comment and message.*

*Edit 2 (because someone said that Twitter screenshotted my post to double down on #medgradwishlist being for URM only): Okay, cool. All I said in my post was that I simply wasn't ""eligible"" to post a wishlist under this hashtag. I didn't say nor imply that I didn't agree with this, etc. The students are deserving and I support this initiative.* ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/m0894c/going_through_med_school_poor_was_hard/
1mmnbu6,Some of you are terrible romantic partners (and should probably apologize to your exes).,"This is going to be long so buckle up and grab some popcorn.

To give a little bit of background information about myself, I'm a current med student in a relationship. However, I dated two med students before I started medical school. I also spent a little too much time lurking on this sub before matriculation, being the gunner I am.

Before I say anything, I will say yes, medical school is extremely difficult. It takes an immense amount of time, sacrifice, and resources, and will end up impacting your mental health and relationships at some point. The person you are with has to understand that going in. There will be nights where you talk to them for five minutes before crashing in bed. There will be days where you cancel plans because you have to study. There will be times where school destroys you mentally and emotionally and your SO will have to pick up the pieces and put them back together. Your partner is going to have to understand that they will essentially be the 1b priority for the next four years (if not longer).

All that being said, Jesus Christ. Some of you treat your partners terribly. They are not your 24/7 on-call therapists for you to constantly complain about everything in your life: school, family, finances, your friends and classmates, even the relationship itself. You cannot expect endless emotional support with almost none in return. They are also human beings. They have off days, they have frustrations, they get stressed, they make mistakes. Giving yourself maximum grace because you're in medical school and extremely stressed while giving them very little is ridiculous. They're also not robots. They're people with emotions who go through good times and bad times. If their bad times (within reason) become a burden to you and stress you out while you're constantly venting about the bad time that is medical school, you're a bad partner.

Giving them very little time or attention. Sure, you may text throughout the day, but if you go weeks without doing things as a couple, whether it's going out for a meal, watching a movie, or just enjoying time in each other's presence, then why are you in this relationship? I understand there are certain blocks and rotations where time is scarce, but again, this is your partner. They are supposed to be priority 1b, not priority 17. I've seen classmates who make sure they sleep a certain number of hours a day, meal prep, exercise for 30 minutes to an hour multiple days a week, get research and shadowing in, even occasionally hang out with friends or classmates, and when they finish their exams, they go out to celebrate and let off some steam. I then hear them complain that their boyfriend or girlfriend is upset they never get to see them. If in all that you aren't finding a few moments of time for the person who is emotionally supporting you through all this, then you are a bad partner, plain and simple.

Cheating, oh my goodness. Cheating is rampant. I understand you're getting a bunch of 20-year-olds and putting them in the same space for hours a week, but holy shit. The first week of med school I saw multiple classmates cheat on their partners during orientation. I've seen students get drunk and end up in strangers' beds. I've seen students making out with classmates at the bar in front of everyone when we all know they're in relationships. I've seen people break up with the person they dated for years in college and who supported them on their premed journey because they wanted to ""see what was out there."" Medicine is the only field I've ever known, so perhaps there are other fields where it's worse, but I don't think I've ever seen people use their partners more transactionally than med students. It's almost psychotic.

Long-distance? Forget about it. Those of you who make it work are incredible people, and I wish more people in this world in general were willing to put as much effort into their relationships as you do. Some of you, however, are the opposite. You have to go wherever you get in for medical school. This is our dream, and we are willing to move to Timbuktu to achieve it. That being said, the parameters of a long-distance relationship are different, and you have to adjust. Being in a relationship as a med student, your partner will already have to sacrifice a lot. In this case, they may have to be the one making a lot of the trips to come see you. They may have to be the one that moves to be closer to you. If they're willing to do these things and you are not going to support them at all in return, then please do not be in a relationship.

I dated someone going to school in San Francisco. She was constantly complaining about the distance, and I was ready to move out there, leaving my friends and family behind to be with her and support her during school. She, however, wanted to live with her friends, so she essentially wanted me to move out there and get my own place. Her family financially supported her, so her apartment was paid for. My apartment would not be. She also wanted me to have an open-door policy where she could come see me whenever she was stressed, needed to vent, or wanted to spend the night. If those same things happened to me, I would have to text her in advance, and she would then decide on whether I could come stay with her or if she was too busy and needed to focus. Needless to say, I did not move to San Francisco and ended the relationship. This was just the tip of the iceberg, but long story short, long-distance is tough for everyone. If you're in one as a med student, please keep in mind it is not easy for either party. Be kind.

The responses of other med students, whether on here or in person, are wild. Anytime I see a post about someone going through a painful breakup on this subreddit, the comments are essentially along the lines of, ""This person didn't deserve you. You are going to be a successful doctor making good money, and if they can't deal with the circumstances of you being a med student, then they're a bad partner."" Bitch, no. Some of you don't understand this, so I will say it very clearly: you becoming a doctor and making a great salary does not mean your partner has to put up with years of bullshit. Again, they will not be the main priority, but they should be 1b. If you want 1b to be taken up by something else, whether family, friends, having fun, whatever the case, then do not be in a relationship. I wish medicine actually attracted the most kind and empathetic people to the field, but in reality, a large portion of med students are people in their early twenties who come from affluent backgrounds, have no life experience, and have never really had to struggle in life. This tends to reflect in how their relationships go.

I know that some people will read this and get upset, perhaps because they recognize some of the things they did to people they were in a relationship with and they don't want to admit it, and others because this is an extremely long and poorly written post that wasted 5 minutes of their life that they will never get back. I'm sure many of you are great partners, given the circumstances, who do as much as they can to be with their forever person. Others of you, I don't even know what to say. Your partner is not an emotional dumping ground for you to pull off the shelf when you feel like it and throw away when things become slightly inconvenient.  Please, just be kind.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mmnbu6/some_of_you_are_terrible_romantic_partners_and/

1hxfwbb,Why do so many students get academic accommodations?,"This semester I'm teaching at a highly ranked institution (T10) for the first time. I was stunned to find that 1/3 of the students in my class have some sort of academic accommodation (primarily extra time on exams). It's certainly not a big deal for me to accommodate this, but I am confused as to why this is so common. Especially since at my previous institution (a much lower ranked school), I never had more than one or two students in a class who needed any sort of accommodation. 

Back when I was a (highly motivated/stressed-out) student, I remember taking exams where it felt like we were evaluated on ability to do the work quickly (e.g. standardized tests), and feeling jealous of any students who got extra time. Now I understand these issues to be more nuanced, and the assignments I give are not intended to stress students, time-wise. That all being said, it does feel like wealthier/more privileged students may be more likely to get extra time, and my experience at an elite school thus far seems to confirm this suspicion. Have others had similar experiences? Or has anyone adapted their teaching to deal with the frequency of these requests?

1ljoczm,I really hate software engineering.,"After months and months of applying, I managed to land my first software engineering internship. I started out my first day getting introduced to the office and people I will be working with.

On the last day of the week, we wrapped up the introductions, me and all the other interns were getting a list of tasks and different things to study at home and catch up on. Now none of the tasks had deadlines so I assumed the deadline was the end of the week. So, I leisured away and really took my time. Having barely finished 1/4th of my tasks. I pull up to the first day of Week 2. And all my fellow interns not only finished their tasks, but did extra stuff too, I was shocked and embarrassed. I felt like I was naked in a room full of people, and to make it worse we had a surprise meeting with our supervisor to catch up on us.

I can't describe the amount of humiliation I had felt during the meeting when my supervisor asked me to stay after everyone left and asked me if I was serious about this.

As the days went by, the tasks only got harder and harder, and I feel really stressed about under-delivering. I can't muster the strength to work properly on anything, and procrastination eats my whole day. I feel useless, none of the ambition I used to have stuck with me and I feel like I was daydreaming the whole time, if this is what a software engineering job looks like, then my future is fucked, and I don't want none of it.

I had talked with a co-intern who I managed to befriend, and he was saying to me how he was having a completely different experience. That he's having so much fun and feels like ""he's in his element"". Does this mean that computer science is not for me? Or hell, any kind of job?

1cz4bkz,Do any PhD students actually take weekends off?,"This is something I am curious about. I keep seeing people say in posts that they take weekends off but I find this hard to believe. Hear me out… I think there is quite an unpleasant culture associated with people pretending that they don’t do any work in order to appear smarter and intimidate others. I really hate this (maybe because deep down I know I’m not good enough to achieve success without working hard). However, I am genuinely curious whether this is actually a strategy taken by some PhD students in order to preserve mental health?
Personally I like working and I will work on weekends because I want to. However, I am also aware that I feel guilty and even stressed taking more than a few hours/an evening off work (even during holidays). I’m also not someone who will stay up late into the night doing work and I have never really understood the idea of staying up all night to finish work either. I think I’m just curious about how people maintain a good balance. I’d say I’m doing pretty good in that I’ve never burned out and feel very happy. However I’m also aware that most of my family members think I have no life.

Edit: I think there may be a difference for more lab based subjects vs theory based. I would love if people weigh in. (Not saying one type of PhD is easier before I get downvoted, I’m just interested in the difference in cultures).

1jgklm5,"I think I'm done with academia folks, passed over for a job.","I'm currently in a tenure track, but soft money position, at a medical campus. My training is in arts & science and I still maintain a courtesy appointment  in Arts&Science at the same institution I'm currently in. I'm pretty involved in the A&S department. I teach a class for them, participate in seminars, sit on thesis committees, help with a T32, and have helped four different professors get grants that I serve as Co-I on. The department did a search for FOUR hires this year split into two focuses. One of the focuses is directly on a topic that I had a R01 just funded on. R01 + ongoing service seems like an argument for me to be brought into the department. I got an interview but nope, just found out I got passed over. No really information for why, but was assured everyone in the department highly respects me and my work and that they still want to collaborate. I know that was meant to try and lessen the blow, but it just makes it worse.

All of I've wanted for the last 20 years since I started grad school is to have the regular Professor gig and know that my position won't go away in a whim of funding priorities. That dream is now dead. It is just absolutely humiliating to be passed over for less qualified candidates (I have the most papers and funding of any of the applicants by far, with many of them being postdocs). This is the only real chance I'll have for swapping departments at this institution so my choice is to move, suffer in the soft-money position forever, or leave academia. I just feel like at absolute failure professionally and to my wife and kids. I had a chance to secure stability and didn't get it.

The greatest rub is that I'll never actually know why I was passed over. Did the search committee not recommend me, did the faculty vote me down, etc? Did they like getting my support for free so there was basically no incentive to make me officially part of the department? Does my tie to a medical department just make me too much of an ""other"" to the chunk of the department ? Are the dozen or so faculty that I have close relationships with really not my friends, because it doesn't feel that way given the outcome. It will be an unending humiliation every time I attend anything in the department now and support people in a department that doesn't value me and straight up rejected me. The catch is that now that I'm stuck in a soft money position I need those peripheral collaborations to cover salary *even more*. It . . . absolutely . . . sucks.

I don't think I can do it anymore;  I'm done with academia. I'm tired of working late into the night every night and always feeling stressed. This year alone I've submitted two R01s, projects on a U19, Projects on a program project, and multiple foundation grants. I never get to just be off. I'm tired of asshole MDs always talking down to every PhD they work with and medical schools never valuing their PhDs. I'm tired of internal politics and no one every being honest and transparent. I can't look my students in the face anymore and say they should get a PhD. It isn't worth it. If any of you are just starting your career leave now. Get out, do something else. Enjoy your lives.

1ggkbsc,"Reflections on Grading for ""Equity""","I am an Assistant Professor who teaches at one of the largest college systems in the U.S. My course load is 4/4 and I am required to do service and publish peer-reviewed scholarship.

To cut to the chase, over the last two years I have been implementing/following the practice of grading for equity created by Joe Feldman and primarily used in K-12 education. Grading for equity argues that we can close equity gaps in our classrooms by making sure grades are:

* **Accurate**. Grades should be easy to understand and should describe a student's academic performance (e.g., avoiding zeroes, minimum grading so feedback is easier to understand, and giving more weight to recent performance).
* **Bias resistant**. Grades should reflect the work, not the timing of the work (e.g., not implementing late penalties; alterative consequences for cheating besides failing; avoiding participation-based grading).
* **Motivational**. Grading should encourage students to have a growth mindset (e.g., offering retakes and redoes). 

To be very blunt, I think it's all horseshit. My students are not learning any better. They are not magically more internally motivated to learn. All that has changed is my workload is higher, I am sending more emails than I have ever sent to students before, and I am honestly afraid that I have been engaging in grade inflation. Although very few students take me up on the offers to resubmit assignments, papers, and exams, it is clear none of those who want a second chance to improve do so because they want to learn better; they are just concerned about their grade. And...I don't know. I'm tired of putting in 50% for each assignment a student has failed to turn in. I have a student right now who is rarely in class has missed several assignments (missing 8 out of 13 thus far) and they have a C!! 

And finally, a male colleague was also interested in implementing some of these approaches and we decided to do a mixed method analysis to see if adopting these practices did close equity gaps in our classes. He is running the quantitative side of the project and I am doing a qualitative analysis looking at students' perceptions of our ""equity"" practices based on qualitative comments in the course evaluations. I knew going in I was going to be annoyed, but I am *seething*. To see how much my male colleague is praised by students for how compassionate, understanding, and flexible he is and I rarely (if ever) get the same levels of praise when we have the SAME policies and practices!!! Where's the equity in that?????

I want my students to thrive. I want them to learn and feel supported, but this is not the answer. In my field and community of people I am around the most, sharing this experience would receive a lot of pushback and criticism. I would be asked to question my privilege, how I am oppressing my students, etc. if I don't engage in some of these practices. I guess I just needed some place to come to where others might understand where I'm coming from. This stuff just doesn't work, but I am stressed trying to keep students happy so I can get tenure while also trying to be understanding about their daily lives and struggles.

  
Additional context: Like most universities/colleges, mine has some unspoken ""rules"" (e.g., the course average at the end of the semester should be a ""B""). As a non-tenured faculty member, I also feel tons of pressure to make my students happy because the tenure process really only looks at course evaluations to assess my ""teaching effectiveness"" (Another unspoken rule is out of 12 measures asked in the course evaluations, committees only look at this one).",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ggkbsc/reflections_on_grading_for_equity/

1mnqtcp,Statistically (and anectdotally) CS really isn't doing that bad.,"Edit: This post is only really addressing the American job market. I have no info on other countries.

I've been doing a lot of research into labor statistics regarding Computer Science graduates versus other majors because a lot of what I've been seeing online isn't matching my experience irl so I've been prepping to post a YT video on the topic. I've been seeing a lot of undergrads giving up CS to go into statistically less promising degrees, and I wanted to see if there's any actual facts behind the CS doom and gloom. I've found that it seems to be mostly manufactured, or maybe negative posts are naturally being brought to the forefront since employed people aren't likely to be posting Reddit all day. Anyway, I went down a rabbit hole of Reddit today and got provoked by a comment into sharing some statistics on the subject, so I thought I'd share them here to calm anyone that's stressed about CS employment.

According to the [Federal Reserve Bank of NY's Labor Market Outcomes of College Graduates by Major](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) stats, which were just updated six months ago, CS majors are still in the top 5 least underemployed majors with an underemployment rate of 16.5%. Unemployment rates *do not* matter much, they count anyone working any job as employed, hence why majors like Art History have a surprisingly low unemployment rate (3%). But underemployment rates count only people working in their chosen field with a justifiable salary as employed. CS is also still the highest paid undergraduate degree based on median entry level salaries.

Obviously these stats have a heavy focus on the NYC Metropolitan area. But the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree) has stats on major outlooks as well and Computer and information technology majors have one of the highest rates of working in their chosen field (more than Engineering and Business, which are both currently seen as ""safer"" on Reddit for some reason). Career growth is currently focused in Infosec Analysts (33%), but Software still has a much higher projected growth than the fields of many other majors with 18% projected growth. These stats are slightly more out of date than NYC's, but paint a similar picture.

Anecdotally I can also vouch that Reddit for some reason is really overhyping how bad the tech industry is right now. I'm a 2025 CS graduate, had two internships and a few admittedly crappy side projects, and got a six figure job. Not gonna lie, the Reddit doom kind of got to my head and I thought the people I knew with zero internships were gonna be cooked. But almost every single person I knew got a job just fine. One of my close friends was cracked and got a job pretty easily. But two of my  friends had no internships and did pretty much zero side projects from freshman to junior year, started LeetCoding and working on projects in their senior year, and both secured jobs. One of them was an international student, too. I also know of several acquaintances who had no internships and got jobs just fine. I actually know of just one person who didn't manage to land a job in tech (as far as I know) and he didn't really give a shit about school. Also, many people I interned with junior year summer didn't take their RO cause they got even better offers FT.

This isn't to make people feel bad if they're currently unemployed, or make it seem easy. Even the people that had a late start had to put in the work to find a job. But after what I've seen in real life, and the stats available, it's crazy to me there seems to be so many people online saying they graduated CS with no job, they know people with 30 YOE unemployed, etc. I don't know a singular good swe that is currently unemployed, including older engineers I've previously worked with. I'm sure there are skilled people out there somewhere that are struggling, but Reddit makes it seem like it's so much worse than it seems to be.

My theory is that people who don't get jobs in less promising fields, like English or Art History, are less likely to be surprised when they don't get jobs. They're probably expecting it to an extent, studied in that field because they were passionate about the subject, and are much more ok with going into an unrelated job or teaching. Whereas many people who went into CS only went into it for the prospect of high salaries and easy employment with zero actual passion for the field (which isn't inherently a bad thing). But when they don't get that six figure salary they thought would be waiting for them, they're more likely to try desperately to get into big tech anyway and air out their grievances on social media.

I hope this post calms some nerves and provides some deeper insights. Like I said, don't want to make anyone struggling with employment feel bad or make it sound like it's easy to get a job. It's definitely harder than it once was. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible, and CS is still a much better field to be in versus almost any other undergraduate major.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mnqtcp/statistically_and_anectdotally_cs_really_isnt/
1ak0w05,Today I quit the PhD program. But not as a student,"I am a PI. Today I decided to get out of the PhD program where I was one of the supervisors. The reason is because I felt too stressed about the bureaucracy, and the responsibilities of giving PhD students the best experience. All my students in the past few years graduated with first author publications and landed a nice job afterwards. But yeah I was never a good mentor, to be honest. None of my students were interested in writing papers or discovering new stuff. They wanted to apply protocols and get the degree at the end. TBH most people outside this reddit are like that, lacking the spark of curiosity. So I wrote the papers myself. I put them as first authors of my algorithms and discoveries. I think having had students doubled my efforts. I found myself writing grants to have the money to hire people who then didn't help even indirectly in writing new grants. A doomed loop of wasted effort. Luckily, thanks to counseling, I discovered the source of my immense stress and decided as a first act of recovery to quit the PhD program before I irreversibly burned out.

I am currently dismantling the rest of my lab, both phsyically (disassembling the desks as we speak) and scientifically (I will have the last few group meetings in the next month, and then let go my last two postdocs).

I feel so happy right now. I have so many ideas to test, data to analyze. Having had PhD students and a lab to manage completely killed my will to work. My productivity plummeted. I found myself hoping someone in my lab would make a discovery, but surprises have always been negative. I had to drag myself to write the last two papers: they were a bit rushed because a PhD student needed them to graduate. I will never again put anyone under my responsabiliy. The final obstacle was convincing myself that there is no shame in quitting. There isn't. Perhaps this recent enlightenment I got at 40yo is what they call wisdom?

My suggestions to all you PhD students here on reddit: you are the best, the right tail of the distribution of enthusiastic future scientists of the World. Don't let problems overcome you. Don't let anyone force you to do something you don't want to, because it's in their mind the traditional way to do it. Many other Professors told me in the last few months that being a supervisor is the only way to have prestige in Academia. Fuck them, they were just pampering their own life decisions and tried to force the same path on me. Say no to shitty projects and collaborations. Try to get your PhD degree (mine has been useful to achieve higher personal freedom, more job offers, and it looks beautiful hanging on the wall), but if also that makes you sad, tired, stressed and shittty, quitting may be the solution.

In the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.

By Rose Horowitch

During their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard’s faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn’t help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.

They were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.

Last year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students’ grades are up, but they’re doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. “A majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,” the committee wrote.

And yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A’s are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.

Of course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. And now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it’s confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren’t so urgent: Can the world’s top universities get their students to care about learning?



The road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. These overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A–, became a not-uncommon occurrence.

At the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students’ emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard’s dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who’d matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A–. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.

The pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020–21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.

Taken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student’s work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A’s for excellent work. Others get the mark because they’re from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. And still others get A’s because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. “So pretty much everyone gets A’s,” Claybaugh told me. “That’s where we’ve ended up.”

Without the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A’s. An incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don’t read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. “I feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,” Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. “This is the place where we’re supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.”

That easy A’s would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What’s genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn’t until I graduated that I, like Harvard’s professors and administrators, came to see these issues—lax grading, high stress—as connected.

When everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They’ve spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. Getting all A’s is necessary, but insufficient.

This has created what Claybaugh called a “shadow system of distinction.” Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They’ve created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit résumés, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn’t considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. “There are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,” she told me. “Even volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They’re highly competitive.” Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.

Max Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn’t prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one’s own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.

This hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.



Now that they know that making college easier doesn’t reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students’ frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.

Fixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A’s that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses’ median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.


Claybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. “If we have the world’s biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,” Claybaugh told me. “And if the students we’re admitting don’t want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.”

If Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration’s assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university’s public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. “We should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people’s eyes,” she told me. “I don’t want people all across America thinking, It’s a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.”",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1n2q30o/the_atlantic_the_perverse_consequences_of_the/

1e7jsa6,My former grad advisor is a reminder of why I decided not to pursue science.,"Half way through my PhD I took a leave of absence. My graduate advisor, an attractive white woman, was incessantly on my case about how many hours I was in lab. It didn’t matter that I had two first author papers and my name on other publications, she wanted my ass in the seat for 12 hours a day. She was terrible to women and minorities in her lab and constantly asked us to toe the ethical line to make our data pretty. She ‘unintentionally’ spread rumors that I had a drug addiction even though I tried endlessly to communicate I was burned out, which was unacceptable to her. The final straw was her inability to pursue the next step in my project, beyond the low hanging fruit. 

During my leave I decided I was going to quit but I needed a job. I began working in another lab while I figured things out. This professor was unlike anything I had experienced. Always engaged with the null hypothesis, never removed the outlying data because the natural world is fucking messy and not a pretty graph and, as a white man, was the most inclusive and caring boss I have ever had. I ended up finishing my PhD in his lab and my proudest career moments are the work and publications I did with him. His research was solid, flawless yet still humble. He has continued to struggle to get funding because his research suggests an entire field has gotten it wrong.

Meanwhile, my former advisor has received accolade after accolade, grant after grant while regularly flirting with the old white grant gate keepers, at least during my time in her lab. I just found out she got a fellowship for aiding women and minorities in science. 

I still struggle with leaving but times like these make me realize I can’t be successful and happy in a world I ethically reject.

Edit: I forgot the best part. One of her senior grad students verbally (almost physically) assaulted me in her lab because of my ethnicity. She did everything she could to get me to not file a complaint because he had such a promising future and he wasn’t really racist, just really stressed out over graduating.

1n42e62,The Hardest Part About a PhD is Everything Outside of the PhD,"Since starting my PhD 7 months ago, I haven’t really found myself struggling with any aspects of it - my supervisors are very supportive and guide me through what work to undertake and how to do it in weekly supervisions, my industry sponsors are very lenient, I have access to all of the necessary equipment whenever I need it, and I’ve already submitted x2 1st author papers (one presented at a conference, the other to a journal). 

With that said however, I feel I get very stressed and anxious about everything that is on the circumference of the PhD. Every single student in my research group is 5+ years older than me, with 5+ years of industry experience, multilingual, far more advanced in the skills/software I’m using - I can’t understand how I’m supposed to compete with them for things like travel grants, internships, PostDoc positions, TA work, funding etc etc. 
I’ve been doing Coursera certificates and trying to upskill as much as possible but it’s a bit like Sisyphus - no matter how hard I work I can’t really compensate for the decades of industry experience my peers have (I came straight from a Masters degree). It feels like any free time I had to socialise, relax, exercise, sleep, read, cook, clean etc. is slowly fading away as a result…
When I’ve raised this issue to the Professors and Heads of Department they are very quick to dismiss it and seem oblivious to the lack of equity (there’s even PhD students 50+ years old who were company directors). 

Does anyone else relate to this or have any advice on how to navigate it? I’m studying in STEM in the UK. It would be great to hear other people’s thoughts/experiences ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1n42e62/the_hardest_part_about_a_phd_is_everything/
15iiell,I regret my major,"I am a biology major going into my 3rd year this fall. 

During my 1st year, I looked forward to entering the medical fiend and going to become a doctor. After realizing the required amount of time and atrocious debt, I decided against it and tried to pursue a goal in the healthcare field elsewhere. I was hoping to get into physical therapy, but even that requires a doctorate degree as well. 

So now I'm failing Organic Chem II for the second time. I'm trying so hard, studying for hours on end, but nothing is working. My GPA is tanking. I don't have any shadowing hours on record. I'm unmotivated, stressed, and emotionally fucked up. I'm 100% not doctor material.

The Biology degree is a trap. I don't want to be a researcher or anything like that. In order to actually get into a well-paying field you have to become a doctor of some sorts. And becoming a doctor means you have to do well in school.

I see all these doctors saying ""Don't worry, I got a C+ in a class before"" or ""Don't worry, I once got a B-."" Well I'm failing. F. No graduate school-- let alone a healthcare graduate school--wants a student who keeps continuously failing classes. 

My education is fucking expensive. It's expensive and it's about to be completely useless. 

And I know someone's going to say ""it's never too late to change majors""... but I believe it is. I can't pay for college for much longer. I don't want to stay in school for so many extra years.

xqiwdr,Receive a 0% for someone else’s mistake,"Recently my girlfriend, along with her entire class, received a 0 because a phone went off during a test. The prof asked who’s it was and nobody owned up. The prof directly asked my girlfriend if it was her, so she took that time to pull her powered off phone and show the prof it was impossible to be hers. The prof thanked her for showing that it wasn’t her as well as a few other students who took the chance to show their phones were powered off. Is it still fair to give those who proven it wasn’t them a 0? To be more clear this is a career & technology school, not exactly a college. 20% of their final grade is based on this test that everyone got a 0 on. Prior to this 0 she was above the % required to maintain her financial aide. Now she is just under said %.

qww03i,"Calculus Professor just assigned 8 hours of lecture, and 32 quizzes over Thanksgiving break… Please help.","I wish I was making this up… 

I’m a Freshman in Calc 2 and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his “incredible math skills” he’s super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning 4 chapters over break, each chapter containing 4 30-minute lecture videos, accompanied by a 30 minute timed quiz for each video. He’s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. 

We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November 29th (the day we get back) So he’s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these 4 chapters is also the day we get back from break.

So I’m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I’m so stressed out and now I won’t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!


Update: 

Wow, I didn’t expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. 

I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only 16 20-minute quizzes, not 32 as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of 4 chapters, each with 4 videos and a quiz after each video.

It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it’s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. 

If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus 2 in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his “teaching strategy.”

1mqjpxa,Hiring mamager said they felt bad for me,"Obviously a doomer story, but I'm a fresh graduated CS student in Montreal with 2 startup internships and some personal projects (through riipen, would def suggest if you're a student looking for internships), trying to focus in data (analytics, science, engineer, etc), and have been applied to 300/400+ jobs over the past few months.

I get maybe ~2/3 recruiter calls a month, half of which are for positions that don't match. Had a really promising position lined up, I was out of 8 selected for a role on a new junior team of 4, then the company scrapped it before onboarding.

Maybe ~3 interviews a month, and had one last week, passed the initial, went on to the first technical, position seemed like a great fit, junior role, great flexibility and compensation. HR liked me, technical hiring manager liked me, then they told me they had gotten over ~1400 applications over the course of a day. Cut out a lot of those to ATS, then cut anyone seeking a work visa, and then of the remaining, selected ~30 for interviews. 

Told me they felt bad for me, as before they'd get like 10 applications, which is crazy such a jump in a few years. Doesn't matter if it was a junior entry role when you had mid/senior devs who got laid off and looking anything ig. Got the news at the end of the week that they were pursuing more qualified candidates, which I mean, cant blame them, getting senior/mid tier engineers or MANGO juniors for the cost of a junior engineer would be a no-brainer.

Had another interview today for a startup, way less flexible, ~$22/hr (almost half the pay), onsite. Which went fine, but like :/. I have a part-time job for now that pays around that so I'm not super stressed, and don't know if I'd actually consider.

Tl:dr: Oversaturated rat-race watering down my position and compensation expectations

I was proud of myself until we took a final administered not by our professor, but by the head of the math department. We had 2 hours to take it, around 25 questions, and the questions were extremely odd and different from anything we’d ever learned. Most of the questions, I’d never seen in my life and we had never touched upon it in the entire semester. 

The entire class failed, and now my average is down to somewhere in the 70’s. The professor refuses to give extra credit or a retake and won’t answer his emails. The other precalculus classes had easier exams, but were still in the same situation.

r6ghoy,How strict are profs with word counts? Is this reasonable?,"I had a discussion post assignment that asked for 200 words. It said in the requirements to avoid going over 200 words, but that we could go over by a little without penalty. Anyways, I took this to mean that I should avoid going over 200 words, and that the word count requirement was not extremely strict.

This discussion post assignment was pass/fail, so you can either get a 0 or 100. 

I wrote 198 words. She gave me a 0 because I didn't meet the 200 word requirement. I put a lot of work into writing my discussion post well, and it was all just a waste of time and effort because of two words. I sent her an email explaining my situation and how I didn't realize she wanted EXACTLY 200 words (nowhere in the requirements did she clearly say we needed EXACTLY 200 words). She replied saying there were no exceptions, so I'm stuck with a 0 on this assignment.

The ironic thing is that this was for a creative writing class, and the content of my writing had no bearing in the mark but writing exactly 200 words did.

EDIT: Lots of people telling me to take it higher up, but I'm not going to bother. The end of the semester is coming up and I'm pretty stressed out already.

1i4v1l0,"Unpopular opinion: If we're not learning, and you're not teaching, send us home","Sitting here on a Saturday night finishing up my final 12-hr graveyard shift in L&D for my OBGYN rotation. It's been a long week. I'm laughing to myself that I not only signed up to be here, but in fact, took out loans to be here.

Sometimes it feels like in certain specialties, once you tell them you're not going into their field, they just assume you're not interested in learning at all. There was a new team on tonight, and the senior resident didn't introduce herself, didn't ask for my name, and just told me to talk to the intern. It wasn't even busy at the time. When the senior needed me to run an errand, I overheard her ask to the intern '*what's her name again?'* to then send me to pick up meds from the pharmacy. But she ignored me for the most part and spent half the time scrolling on instagram because it was a slow night.

On other shifts I was actually running around, getting histories, doing exams, helping in the delivery rooms, doing stitches in the OR, and actively trying to absorb what the people in this field do. Great, that's exactly what I came to med school for - to learn and to practice patient care. Right now, nobody is close to delivery, I checked on the moms if they are ok, the residents are just typing their notes and writing handoff instructions, and I asked if I can just go if it looks like they don't need my help anymore. I could use the extra few hours of sleep after doing 5 night shifts. She said no. 

I'm genuinely sitting here thinking to myself, wtf. Why am I held hostage here. I get there could be emergencies on L&D, but in a true emergency, would I actually be helping or in the way? Would I be able to observe up close to learn something, or would there be too much chaos to actually learn? I understand residents have no obligation to teach us because that's literally unpaid labor for them, but I think the reverse also applies here. I have no obligation to run errands for you either if you don't even do the bare minimum to include me in the team and spend 30 sec on introductions. But on all my past rotations so far, I was fortunate enough to have residents have been so nice and loved teaching, so it made me happy to be able to help them with notes or other small tasks.

Maybe it's just my school, but my experience with OBGYN people is that they're pretty no-nonsense and don't seem very welcoming to students not intending on matching into their specialty. And I feel that this sentiment definitely translates into our learning experience. So now I'm left feeling like I'm stuck here for no reason other than arbitrary rules to spend at least 60 hours/week (with some very unhappy and stressed residents) suffering in order to pass this clerkship. I'm willing to suffer 60 hours/week if I'm getting something out of the experience - whether it's for learning, or it's for something I'm passionate about - but this clearly has not been an experience conducive to my learning. 

TLDR - here's my unpopular opinion: our priority as med students is to learn. It is also our responsibility to seek out opportunities to learn. But if learning is not happening, we should not be here. And if there's no opportunities to help patients, we should also not be here. Everything else we do on top of what has been stated is because we want to be helpful, but it does not contribute to our education. So please just send us home once our work is done because we're sleep-deprived enough as it is.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1i4v1l0/unpopular_opinion_if_were_not_learning_and_youre/

f4tvvn,Are we tolerating the status quo too much? [Serious],"In today's medical culture, are we undervaluing physicians by tolerating the status quo?  The status quo of rising medical school costs, poor mental health, mistreatment in residency, broken technologies, inflated administrative costs, etc?...  We limit medical student postgraduate options to internship and residency, yet we graduate NPs and PAs to begin supervised practice with a starting average salary of $105,000.^([1,2](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/nnQn+Rhob))  Meanwhile, medical students graduate  unable to practice medicine without an internship (that pays an average starting salary of $56K.)^([3](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/DW0u)) I'm not arguing against physician extenders or residency. **I'm arguing against the status quo in medicine.** 

To be licensed as a physician in most states, you must complete a year-long internship.^([4](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/GKZv)) California is requiring multiple years of post-graduate training.^([5](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/KWbu))  Our status quo provides no in-between licensure options for medical students, while we are simultaneously graduating NPs and PAs into supervised practice. In 26 states, NPs can practice autonomously in their field immediately.^([6](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/g0nU))  Why are physicians that graduate from a US medical school and cannot match into a residency (for whatever reason) less able to practice medicine than NPs and PAs?  Is it just the status quo? 

Right now, of the medical student graduates who do not go to residency, some become scribes, MAs, and consultants. ^([7](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/1zpK)) Very few find research jobs, and even fewer gain a temporary license that allows them to practice at the level of a mid-level under the supervision of a physician like you can in Missouri.^([8](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/JJ9P))  So what are you, the physician, to do?  The Flexner report of 1910 gave us the gold standard of medical training for the time,^([9](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/qNBL)) yet we act like no future improvements are needed today.^([10](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/6v56)) 

If you're like me, you have some changes in mind.  I can list several improvements I'd like to see.  First, rising school costs are trapping students.^([11,12](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/zFeu+P40u)) Medical school graduates have, on average, $251,600 in debt these days.^([13](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/ggr7)) The debt doesn't disappear, either, for those who cannot match into a residency.  Medical schools are increasing tuition annually and federal loans accrue interest from the beginning.^([14](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/P50Q)) Why do we allow interest to begin accruing so many years before employment is possible, and why do we pay so little?      

Medical schools should aim to produce autonomous physicians, but not every graduate can achieve an internship.  What are they supposed to do? Physicians should create a ""supervision-required"" midlevel-style license for medical school graduates that haven't completed an intern year.  Otherwise, less painful routes to the top of medicine will continue to gain steam. Administrators need to fill gaps in their hospital systems with providers from somewhere, after all.  

We have a physician shortage, despite an increasing number of medical schools and residencies.^([15](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/fgme))^-([16](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/f8ym))  In fact, the total number of residencies available has increased at the same rate as medical school enrollment.^([17](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/FMlm)) However, in 2019 there were still 44,603 students competing for 35,185 PGY-1 spots.^([18](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/u0o7))  You have a huge discrepancy between PCPs and subspecialists, so applicants are unevenly applying to the higher-paying fields.  Also, IMGs are applying for US residency positions. 

Then there is the status quo of mental health crises among trainees and other physicians. Still, physicians and students commit a substantial number of suicides every year.^([19–23](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/MMMm+XOXG+2G4w+VDdC+9f6k)) That's not a fun fact. Perhaps you're like me and have known someone to take their own life.  Medical training and practice are toxic because of the high stakes.  There are board exams used as gatekeepers to certain competitive specialties.  You are often sleep-deprived and stressed. Not to mention, if you are careless then someone dies (no pressure). Also, healthcare costs are skyrocketing due largely to administrative expansion.^([24](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/bwu3))  Overall, there are fewer and fewer resources for physicians to utilize.^([25](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/HShL)) It's a tough environment right now.  We have to buck the status quo.

**You can** fix the illogical things we are doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing quality. Where to start?  Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses.  It just takes some common sense, optimism, and compromise. It takes all of us.

**Physicians need to get more active in politics.** Policymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement by you, the physicians. For example, we have 1,100+ EHR vendors, in 2020, that cannot communicate data between each other.  That is the status quo.  However, if forced to do it, I argue EHRs could share data.  How?  If policymakers mandated some standard changes to the requirements for all EHRs.  We would need to mandate the creation of a unique identifier that all healthcare providers use to find common patients, a mapping between coding languages, and a system to distribute stored data storage between systems.^([26–28](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/LV9u+oIpW+20oA))

**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to remember your leadership roles** in the hospital, the community, and beyond to seek progress.  Physicians need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen.  If we can do that, we don't have to worry about anything. The problem is, there are very few physicians with enough of a spine to stand up to the status quo.  Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked.   **You're not alone.**  We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  It's got to be the *physicians*.  


The status quo has got to go.  **How will you stand up to it?**

1lnigfo,Attendings + Residents do NOT understand Step 2 stress,"Currently on a 4th year elective rotation, and every single time I bring up studying for step two, being stressed about step two, kind of hinting to maybe leave early if it’s slow- these attendings could not give a flying shit. Even some of the older residents don’t really care either. I’m assuming it’s because when they took step two, it was just a silly exam that didn’t matter as much since they already had their step one score. But now with step one being pass no pass, this exam is insanely important. The averages for some specialties are actually unhinged. I feel like the old guard need to be sat down and told this is a crucial exam for applicants now and should be treated with same degree of importance as Step 1 once was.

1gw3qc8,Just found out I'm pregnant. Can I still achieve my dreams? :( ,"I was supposed to enter grad school next fall. But now I'm having a kid. Is it possible to finish with my graduate degree in psychology while raising an infant/toddler? I'm feeling really depressed. I know what everyone has told me about life turning upside down. But... Is it possible? My husband is a school teacher. I'm an ESOL tutor. We don't have enough money, so I have to make more money than I do to afford our baby. I'm just so stressed. I also had dreams to travel. I guess that is going out the window. Also, abortion just isn't an option for me personally. I can't do that.

EDIT: Thank you to those of you who commented with genuine concern, care, and advice. I TRULY appreciate everyone willing to help me whether that is giving me some hard, real talk or an optimistic, fresh perspective. I've decided to let all the inspiring stories, in which many of you have shared, about being pregnant and/or raising children while pushing through school AND work (or knowing someone who lived through those experiences) continue to motivate and inspire me to never give up!!

1dh4u3o,Is it reasonable to quit because of money ,"I like being a PhD student. I don’t think I’m bad at it. I can do conferences. I have several publications on the way. I’m passionate about my research topic and I think it’s important. I comp next semester, so it’s not like I’m just beginning the program. 

But god it all feels pointless when I spend most of my time stressed about money. My stipend is shit and barely covers the rent of this over priced town. 

My friends are buying houses and settling down and I’m crying over the fact that I can barely pay rent this summer let alone buy groceries. 

It would be so easy just to quit. Get a normal job with benefits and stop being so stressed all the time.

Is money a good enough reason to quit? This is my last year of funding and I don’t even know how I’ll survive after that’s gone. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1dh4u3o/is_it_reasonable_to_quit_because_of_money/
jnffjf,An Honest Letter from Your University President About Fall and Our Plans for Spring,"Dear faculty and students,

Oh, and staff. I keep doing that. If I had any shame at all, I’d feel embarrassed. It’s so hard to remember people that don’t have academic freedom. You’re like Gen X; angsty and frequently forgotten in conversation.

I’m writing to follow up on my original post: [An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We’re Opening This Fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hxd9z8/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/)

First, I’d like to address the disappointing survey results we received from you. Yes, faculty, over 17% of the student body is currently in quarantine or isolation, but we gave you a Zoom license and a 720p webcam with a microphone that captures all sound within a two and a half foot radius. Be resilient. This sounds like a “You” problem. If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we’ve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. 

And please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They’re perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a 6oz bottle of water. That’s 2oz per meal! For those of you who’ve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from 1997, so don’t let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because “their internet cut out”. They’re fine. 

Students: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all 18-22 year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who’ve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We’re trusting you.

Faculty: Since we don’t trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in 2003, we’ve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, “residence hall”). Blinking more than 15 times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. 

Now then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \[drum roll\] spring break! That’s right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we’ve opted to eliminate spring break in 2021. For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:

* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. 
* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it’d be to take a job at the next closest university 58.3 miles away. 
* Disconnect from social media.
* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. 
* Make a list of how many days it’d take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. 

If you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you’ll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA 9th edition format), two doctor’s notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $2.37 left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn’t have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother’s social security number, and President Obama’s long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. 

Now to answer some other questions you’ve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:

No, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don’t care if you’re not “fine”. Do the same thing I’m convinced you do when you say you’re working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything’s normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. 

No, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student’s taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said ""Their first job is being a student?"" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that “Other duties as assigned” is a literal statement. 

Yes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff. But if they don’t like it, they can just go get another job. It’s not like we’re in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? 

No, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. 

I feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration’s COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don’t expect your “pedagogical mission” or “safety” to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don’t know how you missed this. We sent it via email at 5:01 on last Friday, 23 minutes after we’d sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email. 

Socially distanced hugs and kisses,

Your University President, PhD.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jnffjf/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/
1g5yoey,Rejected a Master's Offer from Columbia,"In my most recent round of graduate applications, I was accepted to a master's in Ecology at Columbia University. However...they did not provide any funding nor scholarships, which would probably mean around $70-80k in student loans after it's all said and done. I ultimately decided to decline this amazing opportunity, because how could I possibly justify Ivy League-level student loans on top of the high COL in NYC? This field is just not lucrative enough to get those loans paid off in a timely manner, and all of the guidance from my peers had been to only go to graduate school if it is funded in some capacity. However, a year or so after making the decision, I'm stressed that I've missed out on something life-changing. I'm quite simply depressed in my current role in environmental consulting. I really regret the choices that led me here today. 

I'm curious of your opinions on if rejecting Columbia's offer was a huge mistake on my part? Be honest, I can take it.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g5yoey/rejected_a_masters_offer_from_columbia/
1kv57t1,"For those who’ve already landed a job, was it actually that hard—or is this sub just super pessimistic?","After hanging around here for a few years, I honestly started to believe that getting a tech job right out of school was next-to impossible. The constant “no one’s hiring,” “apply to 500 places,” “grind LC for 18 months straight” posts had me stressed.

But here’s what happened to me:
	•	Timing: I landed a solid offer a few weeks before graduation (and was in a final-round interview for another role that likely would’ve come through too).
	•	Skills mix: My LeetCode skill is… fine. I’m not cracking mediums in 10 minutes. What carried me was being able to hold a normal conversation, explain my thought process, and vibe with the interviewers.
	•	Takeaway: Technical know-how matters, but if you can’t communicate, collaborate, or just be someone people want on the team, you’re handicapping yourself big-time.

So my question to the folks who’ve already landed roles:
	1.	Did you find the process as brutal as the average post here suggests?
	2.	What mattered more for you—raw coding chops or interpersonal skills (or something else entirely)?
	3.	If you struggled, what was the biggest hurdle? If you didn’t, what do you think tilted the odds in your favor?

Maybe I just lucked out, but I’m starting to think a lot of the defeatist energy here comes from people leaving out parts of their story (or ignoring soft-skill gaps).

1l6p2e7,Google Interview Experience SWE,"It's been 2 months since I joined Google, and I would like to thank the community by sharing my interview experience with Google (SWE New Grad)

  
July 2024: Applied for Google

October 1st 2024: Online Assessment

October 3, 2024: The recruiter reached out to me and mentioned that I need to schedule my interview on or before October 31st. I have scheduled my interview for October 31st.

Preparation: I have solved NC150 which has helped me to prepare for the interviews. But, I need to practice more problems for DP, Trees, and Graph concepts. Hence, I started to refer to the TakeUForward set of problems on YouTube. I have scheduled a mock interview every other day to practice my communication.

  
Round 1: Behavioral interview. Nothing fancy, Just the standard set of behavioral questions you expect in an interview

Round 2: I was asked a DP problem, and I kind of fumbled a bit, just because I was stressed for no reason. The interviewer was friendly. He described the scenario, and I asked some clarification questions. Later, when I asked for a testcase, the interviewer suggested I come up with my own testcase. I explain the approach, and the interviewer gave me the green signal to code the problem. After coding the solution, I had dry run the code with my testcase. The interviewer gave me a different test case, which I had to adjust the solution a bit. Then the interviewer asked me a follow-up question, which I managed to solve in the last minute. After that, we discussed the time complexity and space complexity.

Round 3: Hard backtracking problem. The interviewer was not as friendly as the first one. Initially, I thought it was a math problem and started to think on that ground. But later, the interviewer modified the question a bit, and then I thought it is a backtracking problem. The interviewer suggested I come up with a testcase and the output as well. This helped me to build the logic for the problem. After 20 minutes of discussing and thinking, I started to code the solution. I should have asked more questions on the input format, which would have saved some time. Anyways, I managed to solve the problem in the last minute and messed up the time complexity. 

Round 4: Easy medium hashmap and heaps problem. My favorite interviewer was among all the rounds. Understood the question within 10 minutes and coded the problem in 10 more minutes. We had a verbal discussion of follow-ups, and the interview was done in 30 minutes. I was just asking some questions about some interesting projects that he is working on  at Google

November 11: Got an email from my recruiter that I passed the interviews

For the next 4 months, I was stuck in a team match phase. I was frustrated as I hadn't received any call.

Feb 28, 2025 - March 10 2025: Got 4 TM calls from Boulder. Just some random questions regarding your resume. You can ask about the projects that the team is working on, the ,culture etc. Managers just go with the vibe check. If you think you are interesting, then they will extend the offer.

1gmlknu,It’s true what they say that a college degree makes life easier*,"I went back to college in my late 20’s. Before that, I was working in bars, restaurants, coffee shops, trying to get by through scrounging together a living. I never considered going to college to be a viable option until one day I just got sick of being so purposeless and poor working in a cycle of dead end jobs, so I enrolled in my community college to get a science degree.

Fast forward four years and I’m finished with my bachelor’s degree and already have a job making $100k+ a year. I have a really nice apartment, a new car, and a healthy savings account. I have health insurance and stock options. I wake up every morning feeling less stressed and more at ease.

Of course some people have different dreams, but coming from someone who went from not having a degree and to having one, it feels like life with one is significantly easier than without.

1gei7da,Failed my CS PhD,"I got into a decent PhD program. Coming into the program with an MS, I thought this was my chance to shine. Now, god had other plans. Did TA for a hard class with almost 100 students. I had little or no idea about it. Grades fell in first semester. Since then, nothing is right- every semester feels like damage control. Finally got an advisor and the man/woman is a maniac. Barely slept 4 hours a night for work still no appreciation. He/she/they talked about me with other faculties in the department. At this point, I don't have a future in the department and I will have to leave in a year without a PhD. I didn't plan for this.

However, there is another way to look at it. I did not come in with the strong foundation knowledge to survive the program. I gotta go back to the drawing board and work on my basic and shovel my ego.

1kt6p4p,"Not cut out to be a resident, what now","Now that I'm mostly done with rotations, it's pretty clear that I'm just not cut out to be a resident. The whole time I was very stressed that my medical knowledge was the problem. But based on the feedback I've gotten, it seems the underlying theme is that I'm too quiet/ fade into the background/ low self esteem/ give off nervous energy and that makes people feel that I'm not interested in learning or just makes them uncomfortable, and they say something along the lines that I just don't fit into the group or wasn't engaged with their patients. Also ofc I'm not objective, but a lot of the work I do somehow goes unnoticed or they assume the other med student did it and I'm too quiet/ nervous to stand up for myself when they don't realize I was the person who did it. Finally, when folks do things which are objectively not ok, eg sexist comments, racist comments, force me to work while sick with covid etc etc etc, which is pretty normal and happens to many people at my school, unlike others I don't feel comfortable standing up for myself and just avoid the preceptors which makes my evals even worse.

If third year was so bad I'm concerned that I can't handle the stressors of being a resident, wondering where to go from here. Definitely still want to graduate if they let me. But not sure how to start looking into alternative career paths. Definitely considering something like healthcare consulting, biotech, etc as an md which is an outcome I'd be happy with, but concerned that the same personality traits that caused me to struggle in rotations will follow me elsewhere too...

1m9daoj,I successfully defended my PhD thesis and here is my experience,"I had my viva (thesis defence in the UK) yesterday and I passed with minor corrections. I wanted to share some advice on how to prepare for it:

1. I started preparing a week before because I was too stressed to start earlier. But if you can, start earlier. It takes time. The more you prepare, the more confident and relaxed you’ll feel.

2. The most important thing is to know what you did, why you did it that way (theory, methods, everything), and how you did it. Make sure you have clear answers for all of these questions. Saying “my supervisor told me to do it like that” is not a good answer, you need to be able to explain the reasoning behind every decision you made.

3. When you’re preparing for the viva, you might feel like you don’t know anything. That’s absolutely normal and many people feel that way. I had the worst imposter syndrome in the last few days.

4. Read your thesis pretending you’re the examiner, and think about what you would ask yourself. Re-read the key papers and also catch up on any recent work in your area so you feel confident discussing both past and current research.

5. Finding mistakes in your thesis and having panic attacks about it is also completely normal. Honestly, my examiners didn’t even notice the ones I found. Maybe because they’re focused on understanding your work, not on every little detail.

6. There’s no way your examiners will know everything better than you. They might know certain areas better, but you know your research better than anyone else. Try to be confident, you did all the work!

7. It’s likely they’ll ask broad questions and have a general discussion. I literally prepared answers for every possible question they might ask. It’s unlikely they’ll all come up, but doing that helped me feel more confident.

8. I prepared lots of notes for my answers, just in case I panicked and forgot everything I knew. I didn’t use them during the viva, but having them made me feel more comfortable.

9. There are some general questions they’re likely to ask, like: “If you were to do this research again, what would you change?” or “What are the implications of your work?” Prepare short, clear answers for those.

10. When answering, take your time. If you’re unsure what they’re asking, ask for clarification. You can say “I need a moment to think.” Don’t rush or ramble, take a second to collect your thoughts before speaking.

11. You might not be the only one feeling nervous. One of my examiners was doing their first viva and was nervous too. My supervisor told me even experienced academics get nervous, they want to understand your work and ask good questions.

12. Lastly, and this might sound mad, try to enjoy it. The viva is a discussion about your thesis. Be curious and open-minded when answering. You can even ask them questions about what they think.

The day before the viva, try to do something fun or relaxing, whatever helps you unwind. I went for a long walk and had a nice bath, and it really helped.

1g3okqk,Missed my mid term,"So the title says it all. I had my midterm on Saturday from 9-11 am but accidently I had written it down as 12-2. This is because all of my mids for this session were from 12-2. However this is no excuse. I realised I messed up when I reached campus and immediately got hit with a wave of panic. I ended up calling my instructor who told me to go to the admin office and get the head of examinations on the phone. Immediately after she told me she would be taking retests for another ill student and that she would do something for me.

Now I know that sounds comforting. Shes a very strict teacher but I sit right at the front and make sure to ask questions, usually ace quizzes and always show up on time. However I recently learned that in order to get approval for a mid term I actually need to submit a formal request through our university online system, and there is no option for being stupid. Only genuine reasons like illnesses, death etc, plus even if it gets accepted it comes with a hefty fine and a 85% grade scale. Im so stressed I cant sleep. This is 25% of my grade, I aim for being a deanlister and getting a shit grade will ruin my chances forever. Any advice? I already emailed her an hour or so ago regarding my queries. I just need someone to talk to I guess.

Edit: Well if anyone still cares, I got my retest done free of charge. Apparently the form was for something else, or maybe my instructor is a total G, who knows? Anyways, I appreciate your input, cheers!",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1g3okqk/missed_my_mid_term/

1memug0,Professor's approach of flooding Students with AI,"I am a professor with CS background working in a CSE department in a private university in India. Few of my colleagues keeps on posting posts related AI, Agentic AI, ChatGPT, wibe coding contents on students groups, as if there is nothing in CSE except AI. They arrange frequent webinars and seminars on these topics. Everyday day there is a LinkedIn post or news article related to AI.

As a result, our students are going away from coding. They think AI will take care of all these things. Students are now not thinking logically. Even for projecr ideas, they just go to AI and get things done.

I think this is too much. We need to halt. I beleive along with AI, classical courses of CSE should also be stressed and give equal importance. No doubt my research is also in AI but I went through a thorough programming courses before that. AI is harming our students

1df83q8,With regard to all those rigidly against rounding up,"I'm going to take a second and be critical of those of us who are proudly proclaiming that they assign a C+ if a student gets a 79.98, and they're a filthy grade grubber if they ask for anything else.

Even at their best, grading systems are somewhat arbitrary. I taught a ""hard science"" at the college level for about 15 years but I have been teaching in the humanities for the last 6. It's much easier to consistently grade a math derivation than a creative work, but there is a non-zero amount of flexibility in the former too.

Some thoughts that can give me pause about just how well I've made my grading scale: When I divide the work up, am I doing that in a fair way? Can someone still be pretty decent and get a D on my scale? Can they be pretty lousy and get a low A? I have always had to weigh what a certain grade level's work looks like, what a certain amount of effort looks like, and also whether I was doing my job well enough to get the outcomes I asked for. I have also given assignments that turned out to be much more work than I had intended or assignments where I didn't cover some vital aspect in class for whatever reason.

I also sometimes find that a student has lost points by my rubric, but in doing so has gotten closer to the outcome that I wanted. Sometimes students take risks, and those turn out badly. But if they are much more vigorously engaging in the process I want them to engage in, I am willing to consider that even if the outcome wasn't what either of us had hoped. The rubric should be a guidepost, not handcuffs.

And when I'm grading, am I tired? Hungry? Am I getting more annoyed because ""nobody is getting it"" and so the student whose name is last alphabetically is getting hit just a bit harder? Did I get through the entire class in one pass, or am I grading half of them in a slightly different frame of mind the next day? Is this the assignment of that one kid who continually disrupts the class, or the one who nods and insightfully answers questions? Is that making a difference in how I assign a grade? I think we all try to do what we can to make it fair and uniform, but it's an impossible task.

So that's a long-winded way of saying, yes grade grubbing sucks, and the requests can be completely insane. But just keep in mind that you've put together a system that is, at best, only ostensibly an utterly unbiased and fair measure of the work they've done. Are you really applying a level of fairness and uniformity to a precision of a tiny fraction of a percent? Really?

On the other hand, if you have an LMS that shows a student that they have a 79.4%, they have an extra credit assignment for an additional 1%, and they choose not to do it, then okay, you may be justified.

And I'm sorry, I know we're mostly massively overworked and underpaid, and that working with a student body that grows more stressed out, hopeless, and seems to be less mature each year sucks. But in this case, I would like to advocate for just a smidge of flexibility.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1df83q8/with_regard_to_all_those_rigidly_against_rounding/
xb2jcl,Condescending NP student,"Today I had my first experience with a stereotypical NP student…. and man did it test me.

A friend of a friend who is currently in their first couple weeks of NP school called me for some advice on how to study. They know I am a fourth year med student. Before I tell them anything, they begin to go on about how much harder their program is than med school. Okay. Strike one. But I ignore and keep talking to them. Then they proceed to tell me how they HAVE to get high 80s on their exams, and asks me (in condescending tone of course) “aren’t you guys ONLY pass/fail?”. Alright. Strike two. The final nail in the coffin is when they tell me how stressed they are that they broke into a rash, and then proceeds to ask “Do you know what perioral dermatitis is?”. 

May I just add that this person also stated to me that their goal was to become an NP as fast as possible? They have 0 nursing experience aside from their masters.

I know he's been depressed, but I'm not sure how to help when he won't talk to me and has refused to see a psychiatrist or a therapist. This is the same dude that didn't talk to me the 2 weeks leading up to both Step 1 and Step 2 (I asked for support and he said that I'm always stressed so it wasn't his problem). Same one that will say I don't make time for him, but when I ask to hang out he's usually been busy. Same one that I've been quick to forgive and tried to be there for since I know that sharing a life with a medical student is difficult. Same guy that was at one time my very best friend.

I know I've asked a lot of him with med school dictating my (and therefore his) life. I wonder how things may have been different if I wasn't in medicine. This makes the decisions I make for residency seem all the more important so this doesn't happen again.

1hamp8g,I got a text asking me when I’m available to meet with the Dean of Students - Should I be worried?,"I woke up to a text this morning about when I would be available this week to meet with the Dean of Students.

This week is finals week. It’s the end of the semester. I’m very stressed, so getting this text didn’t help at all. I’m still a little shaky with the anxiety I’m currently feeling. I don’t know what this meeting will be about, but I’m so nervous.

Earlier this semester, on week three or four, I submitted a paper to my professor that had been partially written by AI. It was very out of character for me to do so. I’m usually a very good student, and I’ve never gotten in trouble with any professors or teachers in the past. When my professor found out and invited me to his office, I burst into tears and had been very forthcoming about the reasons behind why I did what I did. I apologized sincerely and repeatedly, telling him that I don’t usually do things like this and that it had been a very poor decision on my part. I told him I would understand any punishment that came my way due to my actions, but my professor was VERY merciful and generous to me. He said he doesn’t plan to report or get me “kicked out” of university. He gave me credit for parts of the essay I wrote and encouraged me to just do my best from now on, which was a huge relief for me, mainly because I was highly anxious and had a breakdown before I went to his office.

Overall, the conversation with my professor went much better than I could have imagined, and this incident happened at the beginning of the semester.

But why am I getting a text now about meeting with the Dean at the end of the semester during finals week? Is it about the incident? Or could it be about something unrelated?

I didn’t get any emails. It was a text message.

When I asked whoever was sending the messages about what the meeting would be about, they told me that that information is kept private between the Dean and the student but that Deans typically talk about the semester with students and provide resources to help them wrap up the semester smoothly.

I believe this has to do with the incident because I can’t imagine it being anything else. I’m terrified, though.

I’ve also been struggling with my mental health, but I never told anyone in person about it. I don’t know if someone anonymously reported me about my mental health or anything like that. I can’t think of a single person who would do that without reaching out to me and asking about my well-being. I have no idea if a certain hotline I called informed the school about having a student with some mental health struggles, either. Who knows. My mind is spiraling. It could be a number of reasons.

I go to a religious school and haven’t attended Church services for a few days. I’ve also had a total of maybe 3-4 absences in some of my classes outside of just Church-related services. It could be about that, too.

It’s just so frustrating because I have this meeting with the Dean scheduled on Friday, and I have all this added stress and anxiety all week in addition to finals. I’m left wondering why the Dean of Students would want to meet with me at the end of the semester. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation, or if anyone here is a Dean, could I get any possible answers as to why the Dean would want to see me this late into the semester? Thank you.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1hamp8g/i_got_a_text_asking_me_when_im_available_to_meet/
1gsi5qw,"My Supervisor Refuses to Grant Me a 3-Day Leave for Family Marriage, Even After Completing 3 Papers, Including One Published","Hi everyone,

I'm in my third year of studies, and I'm really struggling with my supervisor right now. I come from a family where a wedding is happening soon, and I asked my supervisor for just three days off to attend the marriage. To my surprise, he flat-out refused.

This isn't the first time I've faced this issue. During Diwali (a big festival in India), I also asked for permission to go home to be with my family, but he denied me again. His reasoning both times is that I need to focus on my academic work first.

Now, here's the thing: I’ve already completed 3 papers during my time here, and one of them has already been published in a journal. He only gives me 15 days to write each paper, and I’ve always managed to meet these deadlines without issues. In fact, I submitted a paper to him 3 days ago, and he’s still holding onto the excuse that I need to finish more work before I can take any time off.

I’ve been really stressed trying to balance my academic responsibilities with family commitments, and at this point, I’m feeling really burnt out. I understand the importance of my research and I’m fully committed to my work, but it feels like my personal life is being completely disregarded.

Has anyone else faced something similar with their supervisors? How do you handle situations where they are unwilling to give you any personal time off, even for major family events? I just need some perspective on how to approach this.

It's a bit of a clusterfuck for me to be honest, and knowing on top of that that I'm obligated to let the student record is another crap I didn't need. I already feel awful about not providing the whole class with a better learning experience and this is going to make it worse.

I'm all for accommodations too but I think audio recordings are fucking dumb. I've been there. No one listens to the recordings again.

Then there’s another in our cohort who watches two tv episodes a night of a show they’re watching. 

Mine is that I don’t work while I’m eating. Sometimes it goes as far as I don’t even use technology while I’m eating. Those are the few mental breaks I get and I’ll postpone eating to a moment when I know I won’t have to get work done. After I started doing that my first year, I’ve noticed a big difference.

She is studying around 12-16 hours a day, weekends included, how much of that is studying is questionable, but she puts in a lot of work. I work 8-12 hours a day (during week) and have 2-3 hours per day of schoolwork. But, I feel like I am actively making an effort to spend time with her and I do not get that back. Medical school is the most important thing to her and she says she's studying so hard for 'us' but I feel like our life, and my part in it, is constantly being disregarded to help take care of her. I work with several doctors and medical students at my job and feel like this is extreme.

I moved to a new state to be with her. Bought us a house to live in and I know nobody here. I am taking care of mostly everything for her. I order food when we don't have time. I get groceries. I clean. I take care of the dog. I interact with her family on her behalf. I pay for pretty much everything. I've been planning our wedding. I try to find ways to save her time so that she could spend that with me but it never materializes. She won't even take our dog outside to use the bathroom because she is 'too busy' to take care of that. She will still go out with friends/family and talk to them on the phone for long stretches of time. I don't think I have been truly thanked for doing any of this and is ""expected"" when dating a med student.

I get maybe 5-10 hours a week of time with her for most weeks, that includes things like eating/random chats/shopping/etc. I think some of the things I like to do with her on the weekends (visiting family, going to restaurants, etc) and late evenings (making dinner, cleaning, watching movie) are used to blame me for her not being able to study. She has gotten some low grades, but from what she told me, is still higher than most of her class (and it's pass/fail now so hard to tell). Leading up to big tests recently, she has gone to her mothers to study but now blames me and her mother for some of the low grades that she got.

I have been trying to be patient. We've moved back our wedding date and left it open to avoid things in school. But there have been fights surrounding this and the lack of attention to our relationship and it's kind of spiraling.

Recently, we had a talk and she wants to move out but stay engaged and replan our wedding. I was understanding, knowing that preparing for STEP1/2 is hard, but upset by this. We sat down and talked about expectations. It was to be for 3-12 months but leaning towards 12 months, depending on how she does on testing and what not. She offered up a calculated max time we could spend together to 2 hours per month with a minimum of 0 hours per month during this time and limited texting/calls.

I am being made out to think that I am crazy for not wanting to have this kind of relationship and don't think that will work for us. I just feel like a complete crazy person because I am being told that this is normal and that it is needed for her getting through school. I understand medical school is hard but is it really to this level? Any advice or thoughts on this?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/znukxf/relationship_in_medical_school_is_it_worth_it/

17kyt23,My bf screamed “Penn” instead of my name in bed,"
So my bf is applying to Penn IM residency this year and has been talking about it nonstop for weeks. He’s been wanting this for as long as he’s known the school and mentions it anytime we’re together.

I’m totally cool with that and have supported him through it all. He definitely has the stats to get in so I’m proud of him, but its an insane obsession now. He’s visited the school about 6 times and says how much he loves everything about the school and I mean EVERYTHING.

The campus, programs, people, architecture, history, traditions, colors, mascot, shape, smell?

He literally knows everything about the school and does Penn trivia with me when we’re bored or asks me to help him write emails to residents or attendings he thinks he will work with next year.

Last night we were doing it in bed, and everything was going smoothly. While he talked me through it I thought I heard him mumbling but couldn’t really make out what he was saying. But at the end he screamed “Penn!” and calling it baby and was saying how much he wanted it so bad and would do anything for it. Instead of my name! He said Penn IM!

I asked him about it after and he told me it didn’t mean anything and just kept rambling about how much he really wants the school. It doesn’t even sound like he’s talking about a school anymore.

I don't know where else to get advice from! Please help! For some context, this is my first year in college at a new school and I'm female.

In class I'm in the very back so no one sits behind me, then all of a sudden I got super faint to the point where I couldn't hear the teacher, my vision was turning black, and I got super dizzy. Luckily, I didn't, and regained my vision but right after i felt like I needed to puke really badly so ran out and threw up in the hallway, I got my friend to get someone to clean it up since the pain was too much for me to handle and luckily she did and was nice enough to pack up all my stuff, I didn't know what to do so I just sat in my own vomit for a bit as kids passed and I didn't care at the time because the pain was too much to bear, after I didn't want to be seen in my own puke anymore so I ran to the bathroom and proceeded to roll on the floor in agonizing pain for one hour.

 Lots of people saw but luckily my friend was still there with me. 

I have to go back to class today and I'm really stressed because I puked in the middle of the hallway and at the time I didn't care because of the pain I was in I just wanted to feel better, but now I do care and I'm dreading going back today.

xcxbo8,Medical specialties that could be performed with hand tremors,"I'm currently in my first year of medical school and am getting prematurely stressed about specialty choice. One large factor is the possibility that I will develop essential tremors in my mid 30's to 40's. My dad and \~50% of his siblings have it. They started with very slight shaking and have only really gotten bad, to the point of having trouble writing, as he's entered his late 60's. However, for many procedure-based specialties I don't think it would be a good idea to practice with any degree of tremors. I would love to consider surgical specialties, but I've come to terms that it might lead to retirement by the time I'm 40. 

That said, what specialties would allow me to practice if tremors developed? Radiology or pathology seem like a good fit, but even something like injections in anesthesia could be tough if I had tremors. Hospitalist medicine is something I've considered, but I worry about needing to do something fine tuned if a patient coded. I'm just trying to get a good gauge of what specialties I can even consider given this genetic predisposition.

Update: commonly asked questions
* Can you drop the class? - No it's too late
* Will the grade be curved? - Not according to the syllabus
* Its just a C! get over it - I can't accept anything lower than a B or it will tank my gpa
* How would getting a D help? - If I get a D I will be allowed to retake the class for a better grade
* Just accept the C. - I need a specific gpa for my graduate program which I can achieve if I retake this class and get a B
* it will just average out. - every university is different. my university drops the first grade and only counts the retake on the gpa

r78j80,Parents hate that I'm in med school,"OMS-1 here, and in the minority here for parents that actually didn't want me to go to medical school. My parents are immigrants that came here and worked themselves up to middle class from nothing so to an extent I understand where they're coming from, but it still can be draining. All throughout undergrad I kept hearing im making a mistake pursuing med school, that I should've chosen nursing because its quicker and a guaranteed career after finishing up undergrad. 

Once I got into med school, I thought hey, they just wanted me to get on my feet and applying to med school must've felt like a gamble to them. Now they'll be more supportive. 

Now knee deep in first year, I'm still hearing how I chose the wrong path. ""You'll be paying off the loans for decades, you're sacrificing years of your life for stress, you have to make sure you're committed or you're going to end up with a house of debt and nothing to show for it, we'll see what happens to you, etc"" 

I feel these are valid points to someone that just woke up and decided they wanted to be a doctor, not to someone who's been working toward this for years. It would be nice to have a phone call with them that didn't circle back to my ""incorrect life choices"". What makes it worse is now I can't really use my parents as a support system for mental health. I'm happy that I'm on the path I'm on, but I'm still allowed to be stressed and complain. Can't complain to them though because then all their fears are proven right.

ygafsz,This sub does not represent what it's like to go to grad school,"I know [USER] was joking, but I decided to give some context for prospective grad students about why the sub looks the way it does and what good (if at all) they can expect from grad school. For context, I'm a grad student in the humanities.

**Why is this sub so grim?**

Because well-adjusted grad students probably don't use Reddit.

I'm kidding. Sorta. The thing is that there are people who are good at handling interpersonal issues, who work out and maintain hobbies and relationships outside of grad school who probably don't feel like they have to go to the internet for advice or a safe space to complain. They probably just whine to their spouse or their buddy over a beer after class and go home to throw on Netflix while doing their exercises or something. My *guess* is that a lot of people who come here don't have many friends in grad school and lack a real life community to commiserate with and don't have good coping strategies (me included). If you're coming from a working class background, you have social anxiety, and you're a stressed out first year who hasn't made friends, of *course* you're going to go where you're guaranteed fellowship when you're freaking out or need to vent. Nobody IRL gets it! But the good news, like ""I got published"" or ""I'm making money from a job"" is often easy for your loved ones to understand. No need to post here, then, because you say it to the people in your life and it's off the brain.

My other guess is the situation globally is not good. More people are going for higher education with more and more pressures to succeed while hearing, constantly, that the world is fucking ending. I think there are people going to grad school who aren't passionate about the subject and are hoping another degree will guarantee them comfort even as society crumbles. These people are realizing it might not be worth the effort, since you're basically treated like a glorified intern with a shrinking job pool and, if you're in arts, no private sector to fall back on. The truth is the economy fucking sucks and that's going to impact how people experience grad school when grad school is treated like a key to economic mobility.

Most importantly (as a non-American) this sub has a bias to the US and STEM. Most grad students in most universities are STEM, even if STEM is only half the faculty. I think many STEM students work on their PI's passions before they ever get to work on their own, and they're stuck in the lab all day away from their families. It sounds lonely! Sorry if I'm wrong about that, lab-dwellers, it's just what some of you tell me. I don't speak from experience on this. I think, if you're not doing research in a lab or overseas like an ethnographer, you have a bit more flexibility and you get to study what you like. I did most of my MA thesis from the comfort of my apartment, and also I have healthcare.

**What you can expect from grad school if you go in aiming to get the most from it**

Grad school, for me, has been a vital and transformative time in my life. I've beaten my social anxiety and I've gained so much confidence in my self. I believe I have worth and value! I don't think my time should be wasted. Like I got hired for multiple research project by some of the profs in my department that not only make my CV look killer, they trained me to talk to strangers and make good conversation. I have skills as an interviewer now! I've also learned how to write faster, to research more efficiently, and to write with different styles. Grant writing wasn't something I knew how to do prior to, but now I can add that to my resume if I want to work for a non-profit or something.

I've made friendships with some people that I think will last a life time. My cohort are the only people who really understand what I've experienced. They're amazing people, we have similar values and goals, and we get along well. The tough shit is tough, but that means the people you're weathering it with are bonded to you.

Most importantly, though, is I've *learned so much* and I've *grown.* Don't get me wrong, I've had my stress-out days. But the world feels so much more manageable. I feel like I can start to face it and I'm not stressed out if I encounter something I don't know, because I've figured out a lot of difficult things before! A problem is a learning opportunity, not a terrifying threat to my person.

**But like, everyone on here is miserable!**

Listen, the university is *fucked*. Grad students are being exploited in the same way artists who are paid in exposure are being exploited. We're passionate apprentices eager to improve and the system is built to profit off of us like walk-in clients at a conveyor belt nail salon. You need to know how hard it's going to be. No one encouraged me to go to grad school. Like, people congratulated me once I got in and told me they believed in me. But I get why no one pushed me until I had made the decision: most people genuinely think it's unethical to encourage someone to go to grad school without warning them that it's not usually pleasant and the reasons for that are economic. I had a fully funded ride, so I didn't have to work during my courses and my rent didn't eat up my entire stipend. You might not, and you might have undiagnosed mental illness, and you might not connect with anyone in your program, and your advisor might not be so supportive... You're hedging an enormous bet for the love of learning when you apply for grad school.

But if this is something you have to do, you'll go through it and come out stronger and more formidable than you were before.

As for regular users of this sub, I think it's probably important for us to post more positive content from time to time, like our successes or funny stories or neat factoids. We have to remind ourselves why we do this so other prospective students watching us go in looking for that kind of experience while bracing themselves for the impact. We don't want people to go in thinking they're inflicting pain on themselves for no reason.

&#x200B;

Edit: to the people saying I'm not acknowledging that other people's experiences are different, I actually do! Read the third to last paragraph.

As for the people saying I'm not acknowledging the systemic forces that are pushing people to their breaking points, I do touch on it when I say ""the university is fucked"" and ""grad students are being exploited."" I also literally say the reasons for many people's misery are ***economic***. What is the economy?

re7dsp,A Guide to Surgery: How to survive (and enjoy!) your most feared rotation,"I had my surgery shelf this week; naturally, I decided to write this post instead of actually studying the night before. This advice may not work for everyone, but it's based off of my experiences (and the experiences of others!), and I think it can serve others well. I also think much of it applies to all the rotations in general, not just surgery, and a lot of it is based off of advice I've gotten from other people, but I've also thrown in a good bit of new stuff as well. If people like this I may also write others for other rotations in the future as well. I will withhold shelf advice for now as I have no idea how I did yet.

**A little about me:** I attend a Top 25 medical school and did my surgery rotation at a large academic hospital that sees a very high daily volume of specialized surgical cases. I'm someone who's struggled with third year from a time-management perspective as a I have a lot of super random hobbies and having to kick those to the side for the year has been quite difficult for me.

There are four sections to this. I know this is super long, so read the pieces you feel will be most helpful.  
**Personality Hacks: how to win people over**  
**Pimping Hacks: how to survive the barrage of questions in the OR**  
**General Hacks: how to survive rounds, presenting**  
**OR Hacks: ""situational awareness"", foley placement, suturing, etc.**

# Personality Hacks

**1. Be confident and friendly.**

This seems obvious, right? Everybody told me this going in, but nobody told me how much it is easier said than done. When you show up and most people ignore you, or they're too busy to pay attention to you, it can be pretty daunting and it's much easier to stand in the corner and not talk. This is not always a bad thing; it's good to know when to keep your mouth shut, so obviously use your best judgement (i.e. if your team is running to a code, probably don't ask people if they've seen the newest Marvel movie). However, you will find that most medical students don't attempt to actually be-friend their residents or attendings, especially on surgery; you will find if you can get people to tell you about themselves, **even if they're not initially blatantly nice to you,** that they will eventually warm up to you. Many of the residents are over-worked and very stressed and/or may have had poor experiences with other medical students; don't take it personally if you can't win somebody over. In my experience, though, if you can get someone to tell you **why** they're stressed, they will often become much nicer to you as they no longer include you in the list of things that is adding stress to their lives. This is especially true if you can make them laugh/talk with you about their hobbies, etc. In my case, my intern was a subspecialty resident who had to be on general surgery for a few months and missed being with her fellow interns. Obviously, you still won't always win everyone over but just take it in stride and move on.

If the attending or the residents in the OR clearly likes to talk about movies, sports, the news, etc, **participate in the conversation** (again, as long as the patient isn't actively bleeding or something). Truthfully, your final evaluations will reflect how much people like you and how much **effort** you put into the rotation, **not** how much you know (more on this later). This seems **so** simple but again it can be very daunting especially if no one ever addresses you directly. Attending pimping you too much? Ask them about themselves. Where they trained, their favorite cases, if they have a family, etc; people love to talk about themselves. Use this to your advantage.

**2. Be nice. To EVERYONE.**

Another seemingly obvious one. **Introduce yourself to everyone, especially in the OR**. This was really difficult for me at first; people in the OR are constantly moving and doing their own thing and I was afraid to get yelled at

The truth is that people also talk about the medical students amongst themselves. Like, a lot. **But this can be a good thing**. I had a resident I didn't even work with text me to tell me that the other residents were talking about me because they were so impressed with how friendly and helpful I was. I promise, the residents don't care about how smart you are; 9/10 times they care more about if you help them and if you can be friendly enough to make their lives slightly less miserable.

**Pro-tip**: If you can befriend the scrub nurses, you win the game. Seriously. If residents and attendings notice that they're joking with / being nice to you, they will automatically do the same. We naturally like new people that those we trust are nice to / friendly with. **An easy way to do this:** Help tie up the gowns of the scrub nurses (though maybe wait until a week or so into the rotation when you are more comfortable with the sterile field). They will **love** you; it shows that you're friendly, that you're helpful, that you can anticipate what needs to be done without getting in the way, and they will immediately respect you going forward. There was only 1 scrub nurse throughout my combined 10 weeks on in-patient OB/surgery for whom I was not able to befriend this way. And remember and use their names, even if you're only with them for the day! They're people too and they'll appreciate it.

**3. Be as helpful and learn as much as you can, even if you have no interest in surgery.**

**If you have no interest in going into a surgical subspecialty**, at least feign interest so that people feel like you're invested. And you never know - something you learn might help you in the future; you'll have a better idea of when to consult surgery, what medical management you can help out with on surgical patients when you're consulted in the future, etc. Also - put in extra work the first week and people will usually push you to take breaks, go home, etc. during the following weeks after they see that you're committed.

**If you are interested in going into surgery, ask** to help out / do things. The worst people can do is say no. Pulling out drains, central lines, suturing, even using the electrocautery knife / blade; many times if you ask, people will let you do at least part of it. After a few days of cutting suture and retracting with the same attending, I had the chance to do a super small procedure almost entirely by myself - opening an infected wound, cutting out the abscess and washing it out. It was awesome and I don't think I would've gotten the opportunity to do it unless I'd asked.

**Good:**

*""Anything else I can help out with?""* This is good for showing you want to be involved but also good for the end of the day. Most of the time people are just busy and will forget to dismiss you so this is when they'll tell you to go home. And if they tell you to leave, **LEAVE**. The only exception to this is if you're mid-case and/or there's another case and you're actually interested in seeing/helping out with the case.

**Better:**

*""What else can I help you out with?""* This demonstrates that you're aware that there's always more you can help out with and doesn't make it sound like you're just asking to go home. Many times people will dismiss you anyway, but at least personally I found this got me better results.

**BEST:**

*""Just came out of case Z and noticed that it's been \~4 hours since case Y. I can go do the post-op check super quickly and let you know if there are any issues.""*  
*""I know we were planning to pull patient X's drain today - if somebody hasn't done it I have a minute between cases and I can go pull it out now.""*

This is by far the best way to impress people. Obviously, you will realize as you go what you're capable of doing / what needs to be done (most on this later when I talk about situational awareness), but in general offering specific ways to help people is what's going to make them write that you perform at the level of an M4 or PGY-1 rather than an M3, especially if you're doing your rotation towards the beginning of the year.

# Pimping Hacks

Before we get started with these: **your final evaluations will not be reflective of how much you know, unless you're some crazy genius.** Many of your preceptors and residents have worked with 10s-100s of medical students (literally), and in most cases, you will impress them by being helpful and kind, not by flexing your anatomy knowledge (though this can help). I had people write things in my evaluations things like ""smartest medical student I've ever worked with,"" ""more knowledgeable than most PGY-1s,"" and ""did not miss a single question in the OR,"" despite all of these clearly being false. They liked me, they wanted to help me out, so they gave me good evals. This is true on all rotations as well, not just surgery.

**Prepare for the cases you're assigned to the night before.**

I know this is not always possible; sometimes you're busy studying for shelves or sometimes you don't know what cases you're assigned to in advance. If the latter is the case, try to ask the senior resident if you can actually be assigned to the schedule of cases; you will seem invested in your learning \*and\* it will give you the opportunity to prepare.

**Ok, but how do I prepare?** Going into my surgery rotation, most people told me ""oh review the anatomy/find a textbook that walks you through the procedure/read Pestana's/Surgical Recall."" All of this is great, but what I found extremely helpful was simply finding a Youtube video of the procedure and watching it the night before. Most of the time the videos are pretty short, focus on the key parts of the procedure, **and** will label / talk through the pertinent anatomy. It makes it **much** easier when you're actually in the OR as you've literally seen it before and will have a sense for what you're actually supposed to be looking for. I've found that most people **do not** do this and you will really impress people and can make them think you are much smarter than you actually are. This is especially true if you've never been in the OR because you will almost certainly have no idea what you're looking at the first time you see inside a living person, **even** if you know the theoretical anatomy really well.

**Ask questions, but make sure you have a solid understanding of the basics surrounding that question.**

What do I mean by this? An example: for a specific type of abdominal wall repair, a certain ligament is typically cut. I asked a question about the implications of this as it relates to prolapse because I was curious. Some attendings will just answer it and move on, but some of them will also ask you related questions that they think are at your level of knowledge: in my case, I was asked to identify the ligament and if I knew what nerve typically ran alongside the ligament. I had worked with that attending before so I had to come realize he would often ask me these related questions and I was ready for it. Knowing the answers made me seem invested but also prepared. Work smarter, not harder!

Another thing to remember is that **people often start with the obvious and move to the obscure**. The first time somebody asked me a question in the OR they pointed to the diaphragm and I thought they were asking me to name an artery/nerve under it and I looked like a total idiot when all they expected me to say was literally ""diaphragm."" This may not always be true (some attendings like to ask really obscure questions, who knows why), but in most cases it will be.

Finally, recognize that the point of pimping is to push the boundaries of your knowledge. Yes, it's annoying when somebody asks you questions until you get it wrong, but this way of asking questions is literally designed to show you what you know and what you don't. Take it in stride, maintain a good attitude, and continue to be friendly. People will appreciate and remember it (especially the other people in the OR who are watching you).

# General Hacks

**What to expect: rounding**

You will likely be asked to pre-round and present 1-3 patients each morning. Yes, you will likely be the only one presenting in the morning. Yes, it can feel annoying / unfair but it will help you get used to what you need to know / think about it as you progress and get more used to the rotation. Surgery rounds are fast, much faster than medicine rounds, so also don't get offended if people rush you, cut you off, or vocalize that you're taking too long.

Most seniors will start you off with 1 patient and then push you to cover more as the rotation goes on. I think most people will do this anyway, but if not try and make sure that the people you round on are the people whose procedures you were actually a part of - it's neat to watch their recovery process and also makes pre-rounding a little easier because you'll already have some idea of their history and what they're in the hospital for.

Some people may make you write notes, some may not. Some may make you write them and still not use them. Again, just take it in stride - it's part of the learning process and if you get good enough they will likely begin to use your notes: this is especially true on the weekend or on nights when there are fewer people covering each service.

**How to present: rounding**

Some of the following might be institution-specific but most of it should still hold true across the board - I'd suggest using it as a framework and then tweaking as appropriate for the hospital you're at and the people you work with. This will also seem like a lot at first (especially if surgery is one of your earlier in-patient rotations), but you will eventually be able to convey all of the relevant information in 60-90 seconds.

**First**: Introduce yourself and check with the nurses in the morning if anything happened with the patient overnight. Look in the chart + see if anyone wrote any notes detailing subsequent events if so.  
**Second:** Gather all your data (see below for specifics).  
**Third:** Go see the patient.

For the presentation:

**- ID Statement:** *""This is a 35 y/o f with a past medical hx of hypertension and a-fib who is post-op day 2 from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.""*

**- Overnight events**: *""No acute overnight events.""*

**- Subjective:** *""Patient is doing well, no nausea/vomiting/shortness of breath, pain well tolerated on analgesics, tolerating sips of clear liquids, not yet passing gas or having BMs.""*  
These are the main things you want to ask the patients about post-operatively (not comprehensive): fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, tolerating fluids, passing gas / having bowel movements, etc.

**- Vitals:** *""Patient is a febrile, they had one episode of tachycardia to the mid-100s overnight, normotensive, oxygen saturation is 95-100% on room air.""*  
Some people are okay with ""vitals were stable overnight."" Some people will tell you that that means nothing to them (especially if you're an M3, since our clinical judgement is still somewhat questionable), and they need numbers for everything. In general, a good rule of thumb is to write down ranges in the last 24h for everything (temperature, bpm, BP, O2 sat / if they're on oxygen at all) - as people grow to trust you they may be okay with you saying ""vitals normal/stable.""

**- Ins/Outs (I/O):** *""In the last 24h patient had 250cc of oral intake, 1000cc normal saline IV. They put out 800cc of clear yellow urine from the foley and the right upper quadrant JP drain put out 20cc of serosanguinous fluid.""*  
On surgery especially, I/Os are very important as they give you a good sense for how quickly the patient is recovering (and you want to make sure they don't have an AKI or acute urinary retention, etc!). If something isn't recorded, ask the nurse **before** you round so you have the most up-to-date info before everyone else.

**- Labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, Ph):** *""Hemoglobin is stable at 10 this morning, patient has a mild leukocytosis which is down-trending, sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphate all within reference ranges. Kidney function (BUN, creatinine) at baseline for the patient.""*  
As an M3, the hardest thing for me initially to remember was that **people care more about trends than the actual numbers**. For example, a Hgb of 8 is technically outside the normal range, but if somebody's hemoglobin is consistently 8 during prior hospital admissions, that's probably their baseline and is not worth bringing up to troubleshoot. Or, for example - someone's Cr might be 2.5, and this is out of the normal range as well. However, if you look back into the past few days, you'll notice that their Cr immediately post-op was 4.0 because they had an AKI, and a 2.5 is actually a good thing as their kidney function is improving. There are a lot of different example I can give, and this is something you pick up over time, but something to keep in mind as much as you can.

**- Imaging:** *""CXRAY last night shows mild bilateral atelectasis at the base of the lungs.""*  
For the most part, look at the radiologist's reading for the XRAY if you're short on time. You should always try to look at the image yourself as well, though, so you know what you're talking about and can read images in the future if you need to if radiology is busy and it takes them some time to get to reading the image.

**- Physical Exam:**   
*""Heart: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.*  
 *Lungs: some crackling at the base of the lungs bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation.*  
 *Abdomen: Abdomen mildly distended, appropriately tender to palpation, incision clean/dry/intact,*   
 *JP drains x2 with serosanguinous drainage""*  
Obviously, focus most on the system related to the surgery the patient had (if you're on general surgery this will typically be the abdomen). For the most part I would just say H/L exams normal/unchanged and then quickly mention the abdominal exam and that was enough for most people.

**- Assessment / Plan:**  
Always, always, ALWAYS come up with some sort of plan, even if you have no idea and it's completely wrong. Sometimes people will also interrupt you here but again, just go with it. As a general rule of thumb, at least at my institution:  
*-- Day 1: make sure pain is well controlled. Encourage sips of clear liquids and make sure this is tolerated without nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain. If the patient begins to pass gas or have BMs, switch them to a GI soft diet. Make sure the patient breathes into the incentive spirometer 10x/hr to prevent atelectasis. Encourage ambulation if the patient can tolerate it.*  
*-- Day 2: Definitely begin to encourage ambulation. If the patient has had good, clear urine output, remove the foley and see if they pee (trial of void). If their pain is well-controlled, remove the PCA (patient controlled analgesia). Same deal, if they passed gas / had a BM you can up them to a GI soft diet.*  
*-- General: JP drains can be removed once their output drops to < 40-50ccs over a 24h period. If people go multiple days and they still don't pass gas / they vomit or are nauseous etc, suspect ileus vs. bowel obstruction and get an abdominal XRAY. Consider putting in an NG-tube, etc.*  
*-- Electrolytes: For electrolyte abnormalities, there's a lot that can be said but I personally encountered issues with potassium the most so I'll just mention something brief about that: if the patient is hypokalemic, given them 10mEq of KCl for every 0.1 K that they're low. Hypokalemia/magnesia can contribute to bowel ileus. If they're hyperkalemic but asymptomatic, given them kayexalate or some other potassium binder. If they're hyperkalemic and they have EKG changes, you can give them IV calcium gluconate / insulin / glucose.*  
Really, for discharge, you need three things:   
**Off IV meds / pain controlled on oral meds**  
**the patient should be passing gas/having BMs + tolerating a diet**  
**they need to be able to ambulate.**

# OR Hacks

I initially disliked this phrase because at the beginning of my rotation I didn't really get what it meant and I constantly felt that the issue was that I didn't know what to do next / help out with it because I had just never encountered that environment / situation before, **not** because I wasn't ""situationally aware."" This was super frustrating at first, but I eventually came to realize what people meant.

In the OR, **most medical students are in the way**. It's a fast-paced environment, and especially at first, you will always be in the way and it will feel like you are always in the way. If you can stay out of the way, you will impress a few people. If you can stay out of the way **and be helpful**, you will impress a lot of people. A lot of this would be obvious in other settings but the stress of being in the OR for the first time can make your common sense go out the window. Some examples:

1. Get your own gown and gloves before you enter the room.
2. Like I mentioned earlier, tying the gowns of scrub nurses to let the other nurses in the room continue gathering supplies, etc.
3. Get the bed with the patient from outside the room, help position the patient, put on their compression stockings, get blankets/pillows, etc.
4. The attending/residents **and** scrub nurse get first priority when it comes to positioning around the table. Let them figure out where they're going to stand first and then ask where the best spot for you to stand is.
5. During the procedure - if the bed is moved, **move the lights**. Surgery is all about visibility/exposure.
6. If somebody asks for suture, ask for the suture scissors. You'll probably get asked to cut the suture. If somebody asks you to hold a retractor multiple times in a row, you can just grab it from them the following time it's directed your way.

**Foleys:** Watch a few videos of setting up and placing a foley. Somebody will walk you through doing it but it's considerably easier if you have some prior idea of what to do the first time you do it.

**Suturing:** You will suck at suturing the first time you do it. You know it, the residents know it, and the scrub nurses and anesthesia knows it. It's okay. People will teach you and you will get better with time - don't get phased if people seem grumpy or annoyed that the case takes an extra 10-15 minutes because it's taking you awhile to close an incision or port site. That being said, if you're interested in surgery, definitely practice on your own. I used [this kit to practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Training-Include-Non-Absorbent-Surgical/dp/B07HQD6WRX/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=suture+kit&qid=1639251849&sr=8-3) and it seemed to serve me well.

# Concluding Thoughts

This ended up being WAY longer than I thought it would. I don't even know if anybody will actually read through all of it. That being said, the main take-aways are to be nice to everyone, be \*intentionally\* helpful, be aware of your surroundings, be interested without being annoying and get to know the people on your team even if they initially seem cold or distant. I went into my surgery rotation terrified of being miserable and screwing up and while I did screw up many times I still came out having had a terrific experience and with some new friends to boot.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/re7dsp/a_guide_to_surgery_how_to_survive_and_enjoy_your/
lqkmwb,COVID has ruined college,"I know that's not exactly a hot take.  But I'm just so mad and stressed at my situation.  I'm a senior in my last semester.  I'm supposed to graduate in May.  My first year of college (2017-18) was fine, pretty lonely but I made some friends and got to party some, all classes went fine.  Second year was more of the same.  My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard.  Then just when things started to look better COVID hit.  And everything just went to shit.

So now I'm accustomed to half assing everything.  Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting.  Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later.  Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.  When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying.  Now compare that to now, I'm half listening to lectures on my phone at my apartment, getting B's on open note open internet tests, trying to piece together what I'm supposed to do from canvas announcements, emails, and groupMe messages.  Never socializing, just spending all my time with my boyfriend and aunt and uncle.  Never partying or going out or doing anything fun, just smoking too much weed at home in a desperate attempt to keep myself entertained.  On top of all that this goddamn Texas snowstorm just threw a fucky wrench into everything even further.  So I'm dealing with a natural disaster on top of a pandemic.

I've gotten so depressed in college no doubt because my experience has devolved from the fun normal college experience to the life of some bored commuter living in a post apocalyptic wasteland.  And in two months I will graduate and then it's all done.  I have no idea what comes after that because COVID has made it incredibly hard to get job opportunities in my field too.  But that's a post for another day.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/lqkmwb/covid_has_ruined_college/
13wxx4j,How much money did you have in your bank account when you started medical school?,"Obviously, I’ll have loans like everyone else for rent and tuition.

1ma6390,Sophomore year and I already want to drop out,"I’m only 20 and I feel like this is going to be the stupidest decision of my life because my entire family expected me to be the first one to get into a university. I graduated high school with a 3.98 GPA and my parents thought I was Ivy League bound. Which, insanely high expectations, okay? Like I think my parents just have an ego from thinking their kid is smart. (I’m not even that smart, just “normal smart”.)

I didn’t. I didn’t apply to colleges. I didn’t look. My dad signed me up for the local community college and chose my degree without my permission, so when the time came to sign up for classes, I just “forgot,” and upped my hours at my job.

I took a gap year and worked 40-50 hours a week. Saved close to 30k that year. Still lived at home. I still do. And I’m stressed as fuck because if I’m continuing my education and get the bachelor degree my parents want me to, I’m going to have NO MONEY. I’m not going to be able to move out. And honestly, my home environment is part of the problem. 

And regarding my job? It was stressful. I was barely making money and it was kind of hell, but I felt like I could breathe at home and I wasn’t completely miserable?

Year past, parents wanted me to apply again. I said no, they said I should or they wouldn’t pay for it so I did. First semester was fine. Sort of. But then my mental health completely tanked like it did in high-school, I quit my job, found a new one, had to quit that too. 

Second semester was worse. Had to drop out of two classes because I couldn’t take the stress. I have CPTSD, maybe that’s why, I don’t know. But I’ve always felt like college isn’t for me? Or like, not yet?

I’d LIKE to get a higher education. It sounds nice in theory, but now I’m making up my dropped classes in the summer (I’m paying this time), and I’m still miserable. I can’t even focus on the material. I don’t know what’s being discussed. I process the words and the materials but I can’t even make sense of them.

I feel like I’m self sabotaging on purpose by getting so behind in the course material that I don’t have a choice but to drop out again. 

It’s not even hard material. It’s easy stuff. It’s stuff I should understand. Just statistics. I like math. I’m not a stupid person. I’d like to think I’m decently smart.

I feel like I’m self sabotaging because I don’t want to be here. I want to just work. I don’t care if it’s minimum wage. I really don’t. I’ve BEEN doing that. 

And my current job is great, it has flexible hours, I work from home, choose my schedule each week, work independently, decent pay. I wouldn’t mind doing it full time or nearly full time. It’s twice the minimum wage in my state and super easy. I like it. I choose my hours. Some days I start work at 8am and others I don’t start until 2pm. It’s awesome. 

I think I’d be okay with going to a trade school. I never really thought about it, but I’m a very hands on person. I like problem solving. I like independent work. It’s versatile—a decent career path with relatively fair pay. Could potentially seek higher education in the future if I manage my savings right. 

That’s what my brother is doing. My parents aren’t happy with him. But he’s happy. He makes more an hour than everyone in my family and more a year than both my parents combined. He’s set to move out in the next year or so. I just really don’t want to be the only one living at home.

I don’t LIKE living at home. 

My parents won’t sign out of my banking. I can’t open a new account. I don’t have access to my birth certificate or my social security card. I pay for my car, but somehow it’s still in my father’s name. They get mad when I drive it places they don’t like. I can’t leave the house without permission, can’t do certain shit. They think im leaving the house to drink and smoke, when really im just leaving it to get out. Sometimes I just sit in a parking lot. Or go to the library. Or drive in circles for three hours while blasting music.

I think maybe if I felt more secure I’d be okay with college, but right now it’s just adding to my stress and feels like this weird suffocating weight on my chest that I can’t get rid of. I think having a sibling my age is worse, because they used to compare him to me because I was “higher achieving” and now it’s just the other way around. Which I hate, because I never thought I was better than him, and he doesn’t think he’s better than me. We’re both very close actually, and hate that our parents compare us.

1l7omva,Is this ethical?,"I applied to a PhD program and got accepted into a master's with full funding, given that I will continue my PhD. It was not mentioned explicitly that I have to continue with my PhD, but this is how I feel I was given this opportunity, and my professor wants me to continue doing a PhD. I don't have any issues with her and I like the project I am working on.

Now, I am about to finish my master's, and while at the beginning I was excited to start my PhD but now that I experienced the academic life and dealing with professors and students. I think I might not be the best fit for being a professor. I think I will do better in industry and I enjoyed my work before going to grad school.

I also feel stressed about the uncertainty about funding conditions in the USA, especially that a huge part of my PhD will be under the current administration. While this plays a small part in my decision, as I believe or hope that things will be okay, it is still something I wanted to consider. 

I didn't lie in my application or when talking with my professor about wanting to be a professor, but I am always checking with myself what I like and what I don't.

My question is, if I decided not to do a PhD. Will this be ethical, given that I was funded to be a PhD student later? What will be the best time to tell my professor about this decision?

It will be a really hard talk for me as my professor is really a kind person and I don't want her to think that I was not honest with her.

1hyoigw,How do you afford school?,"Hey. So currently a freshman commuter student. I pay about 9K a semester. My father previously told me that he could afford it, however he is refusing to pay. Spring semester starts on Monday, and he hasn't paid my fall installments (he paid a small portion as I had to owe below a certain amount in order to register for classes), and he hasn't paid the two installments that are due for spring. He can afford to send me to this school, as he pays for lavish trips all the time. However, he is refusing to pay in order to control me, as whenever I forget to do simple things such as washing the dishes, he will completely lose his mind and tell me that he won't pay for school. He is very abusive, however I would rather not share the details.

My point is, I hate my situation and I need to find a way to pay for college on my own. My parents, while living in the same house, are currently not speaking, and my mother cannot afford to pay for my college on her own. I'm trying to transfer to a school that offers better aid, however after dealing with many personal issues on top of the issues he has caused, my gpa isn't up to par.

The obvious choice would be to take a private loan right? Well, I don't have a credit score, and both parents refuse to allow me to take out a loan with them as co-signers. What about dropping out or transferring to a community college? Well, my father says he will disown me if I don't go to a ""school with a name."" Very contradictory I know, but that's just how much of an asshole he is.

I hate my life so much, I've never been more stressed. I'm the oldest and while my parents are immigrants, my father went to Berkeley (mother didn't go to college) so I don't think I can benefit from any first generation scholarships. I've tried to apply to a lot of scholarships overall, but haven't won a dime.

I work at a specific store which has mentioned something about funding education for employees, but I am not sure if I qualify as I've only been working since November.

1dpr41a,HELP! Patient Stole Stethoscope,"So for context, I am a medical student in my first rotation which happens to be surgery. My first week started off rough because I slept through my alarm clock and rushed to the hospital, accidentally  leaving some stuff at home. Of course one of the things had to be my stethoscope. 

I arrived halfway through handoff and got the most awkward beaming stare from virtually the entire team :/ Then after being told which patients I was to follow, I tried to apologize about being late and provide reassurance it wouldn’t happen again. 

Here is where it gets interesting, I then told my attending in the process I left my stethoscope at home, apparently that was the last straw. There was a long long pause and he finally takes the most passive aggressive sigh and says “find one” and walks away.

I manage to borrow one of my classmates in the hospital whose on psychiatry and the rest of the day goes smoothly. 

The following morning I’m so stressed out I get there at 5am and see my 4 patients and finish my notes. One of those patients was very odd and kept telling me I was too handsome to be a doctor. Anyhow I realize as I’m finishing up the note I forgot bowel sounds on him and he’s an SBO. So I quickly scurry back to the floor. Patient has just received his morning meds and is quite loopy. I listen to his stomach and hear…. Nothing. I mutter “nothing” to myself and OF COURSE THE PATIENT HEARS ME. 

He takes the stethoscope out of my ears and puts it on to listen himself. Briefly amused I let him finish his examination. After a minute of silence he takes it off ANDDDD puts on his neck. I try to politely ask for it back.. no luck. So out of straight panic thinking my attending won’t believe me and terrified to show up stethoscopeless I began to wrestle the patient for it, I accidentally trip and fall into his bed WITH THE RAILS UP. 

Suddenly I hear a  voice gasp, it’s the patients nurse, where it looks like I wrapped my stethoscope around the patients neck while I’m in HIS BED. Needless to say I’m currently sitting in the chief medical officers office. What am I going to tell them???!!!!

1iajksd,"Fired for being ""too stressed."" At a loss right now.","Hey reddit,
Dealing with a lot right now. 
Tl;dr: my advisor decided I get too stressed about setbacks and picked up that I wasn't happy in general (she says) and decided to fire me about it. At a loss for how to process this, generally struggling with next steps.

Long version:
I'm a PhD candidate in biosci at a US ""top 20"" school. I joined with a strong interest in synthetic biology, and ended up in an engineering department with an advisor who was in the act of ""branching out"" into synthetic biology. I picked up a project that had been passed down through two postdocs and had relatively little in common with the rest of the lab research (some vague abstractions tied it to other work, but very few technical bridges). The second postdoc was there for my rotation, but his contract ended in the first month of it being my (supposed) thesis lab.

I experienced a gradual decline in being happy with my lab. It is not a lab that values mentorship at all, which is a deep struggle we all share. As I progressed in understanding my research area, I slowly came to realize that much (not all) of the work done by the postdocs was not working, but specifically not working in ways that should have been anticipated from knowing the literature. The root of the problem was an advisor who did not understand synthetic biology or the area of work in general. I repeatedly had to remind her or teach her fundamental knowledge of the field, and eventually I quit going to her for advice outright. She is the most ""hands-off"" advisor I have encountered, meaning she doesn't ask for updates or seem to really give a shit about what it is I'm doing (unless it gives her a publication).

Much of my first year was spent trying to replicate some data that I built much of my thesis proposal on. She repeatedly pressured me to publish the postdoc's data with arbitrary deadlines until I outright refused due to it not replicating. I dug up raw data earlier this month and found out they ran 5 assays, and showed only the one where it ""worked."" The other 4 looked identical to my data. 

My stress hit a boiling point one month before my qualifying exam, when I had done about 3-4 months of troubleshooting a method, then I found out it was impossible with the materials I had due to a mutation in our lab strain. I suspected this a year ago and asked everyone involved, but dropped the matter because our strain had been sequenced, analyzed, and published as a supplemental figure. That sequencing analysis was simply flat WRONG, and the person who did it had told me before: ""She (ex advisor) will push you to publish, even if it's not ready, even if it's bullshit."" This left me with functionally no progress on my first aim, 1 month from my qual.

I tried to address the issue with ex-advisor, but after getting an ""ok,"" and an ""I don't know,"" I lost my head a little. I apologized for this later, but there was never a discussion about how I was effected, or how the wrong analysis was published, and I was told NOT to talk about it during my qual. She said that there will be a correction, but every attempt I made to follow up was shut down with indifference or hostility.

I passed my qual in November and got on with life. Early this January, we had a meeting with the Ombuds where she said I don't seem happy. I agreed and said I need more hands-on mentorship. She said that if I was going to seek that, I already would have (at the time I was actively pursuing an internship and an external collaboration). She decided that because I was getting so stressed, that a PhD is not worth the emotional toll for me and I shouldn't do a PhD anywhere. She basically then gaslit me into leaving the lab by telling me I should find a new advisor and not answering if I was being kicked out of the lab. 

I don't know if that correction letter will ever happen, and I'm considering going to the provost. 

Anyway, I hated that bitch, so I'm out of the frying pan. But now I'm desperately looking for new labs and opportunities and stressed out of my mind (into the fire). I did truly believe in my project, even though that lab was not supporting it, so it may be time to grieve that. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. 

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read this far.

1bn8c4h,I am too autistic to be a Professor.,"My disability became evident during my PhD studies. (STEM program at an R1.) I often struggled to connect with my peers and network my way into collaborations. Sometimes I even felt as if social skills were vastly more important than raw research skills in my field. I often felt isolated and as if I was writing my thesis in a bubble without much support from my advisors or my cohort. My heart also was not fully committed to my given research area, but I did my best to push through.

I survived and received my PhD and walked into a situation where I was an assistant professor at an R2 with a 100% teaching load. At first, this seemed like a pretty sweet gig. My department chair, assistant chair, and the more experienced professor who coordinated the 2000 level courses that I teach are all extremely supportive. The environment was a 180 from my PhD program. I still feel a bit self-isolated though and not super comfortable with approaching them with my struggles. 

My main point is: I don't know how to trust my own system. I think it does well for neurodivergent students and horribly for neurotypical students.

During my first semester, I felt as if I really succeeded in bringing my neurodivergent spin on learning physics to the students. I had peer evalutions from my bosses and they seemed to be amazed at how involved the students were during what seemed like a traditional lecture. I received all positive reviews on ratemyprofessors and on course evaluations. This caused my imposter syndrome to really kick into high gear. I'm not quite sure what happened exactly, but attendance for my two lectures averaged at 92ish% each day. Students rarely missed a homework assignment and attendance at every recitation after lecture was high. Part of me kept telling myself that if that many students truly came to every lecture and every recitation and completed every homework, quiz, and test, then the majority of them should have scored a C or higher. I only had 4 Fs and the rest were normally distributed about A B and C. I forgot to mention office hours were packed sometimes.

I have one key feature to my classes which is test points can be earned back. I give three in-class exams, which students must take, and then after each exam students have a chance to solve more difficult problems on the same concepts to earn partial credit back. They earn full credit back if they give written explanations of their thought process while solving the problem. These problems are all hand written by me to avoid having solutions simply googled.

This is all to prepare them for a difficult, comprehensive in-class final exam, for which no points can be redeemed and is 30% of their final grade.

Last semester, this worked well. Students worked in groups but blind copying seemed to be relatively low as in-class exam performance increased over the course of the semester and students began to rely less and less on making points back. 

Last semester I also had a comically long list of students on my roll needing accommodations from disability services.

Students were even supposed to schedule exams with disability services and have extended deadlines, however this only came up a handful of times.


This semester, however, I have few students on my accommodations list out of nearly 300 and they're all in one section.

I am absolutely struggling to communicate with them the other sections. Communicate with them during lecture, after class, on assignments etc. 

Class participation is low to non-existent. Class attendance is at 50%. Homework assignments are being missed. Quizzes are being skipped. Students seem to be blindly copying more than they're working together. Students seem afraid to ask questions in class. Students seem to just not like each other in general sometimes. 

I have been direct with students that they are on track to fail if they don't actually learn the material for the final. These copied take home exams are just wasted points because a 0 has the same letter attached to it as a 59.  

I feel like there's just social roadblocks that I can't get through. Students seem to just want to memorize some equations and get a grade. Students don't want to admit they don't understand something even though I'll literally help them through it. Students don't even pick up old homework and old exams to see what problems they missed or look at the feedback I give. 

I think I don't understand people enough to be a professor. I also know that I'm overreacting a bit, but I'm absolutely stressed. I'm about to fail nearly 50% of an entire class. I think this is primarily because they perceive the class as being easy due to some points being given back on exams. However, they don't see the big picture and how important the final exam. I think my system is not obvious to them and I'm about to have a lot of surprised students in May and a lot of complaints. This is due to my inability to effectively communicate with them when a direct, ""you're going to fail the course."" Isn't working. 

The one other section though, it's just like last semester. 90% attendance. Grades mostly above Cs, averaged around a B and they seem to be cooperative more than copying. 

I haven't even told my bosses that I'm autistic because on the job application I just put ""prefer not to answer"" because I was recently diagnosed and not sure how to address it professionally at that time.

Just end rant I guess, I'm not good with transitions. I also would like to start doing research again, but I would want to switch subfields and have no idea how you go about doing that. ",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bn8c4h/i_am_too_autistic_to_be_a_professor/
11hpx0q,I am losing my shit. All of it.,"Just venting. I once read a post that grad school almost ruined a marriage. I thought.. how? That’s weird. I now see that grad school will ruin anything it wants to. I’m stressed all the time. I have no time ever. If I want to sleep, I feel guilty. I work on something everyday. I have no breaks. I can’t take a break. My GPA will tank. Grad school made me fat because I have no time to cook. I go almost the whole day without eating then binge convenient foods. I have now developed an eating disorder because I want the weight off, but have no time to cook let alone exercise. On the way home today the freeway closed and I was stuck for 4 hours. Hot, hungry, sleepy! The only time in my life where I really felt that I could shoot myself for real and be a splattered mess in gridlock traffic. 
I just feel ugly. I’m hungry. I’m tired. I’m sad. But I made a commitment to finish. I am going to finish. But I hate my life right now. I don’t even know the person I am right now. 
I’m not gonna fuckin kill myself, although it sounds so easy, but also just so boring to possibly be dead and alone. I just need the world to stop for a couple weeks. Or like, if I could go into that training world Goku and Gohan go to where they get all strong in a matter of days but they’ve actually been there for years. I don’t know if I’m remembering that correctly. I haven’t watched Dragon Ball Z in so long. Point is- I would like an Interstellar moment. Except, I don’t want my daughter to look like my grandmother when I get back. I need just enough time to write some of my bullshit assignments so I can cook and eat a balanced meal, have a fucking bath, get some mother fucking sleep, and watch some shit ass tv like I have fuck all to do the next day.

1lfr4nj,Going back home after PhD in France and starting to “regret” it,"Hi,
I finished PhD (geoscience) in France at the end of 2024. I couldn’t land any postdoc or industry job in France so I took the only job offer I received back at my home country (SE Asia). My main problem is visa. No company wanted to hire me as a foreigner in France.

My current job deals with conventional hydrocarbon industry, the field I’ve been working on previously. I feel like I’m getting tired of it but also I don’t feel comfortable with my life in my home country. It’s very stressful for me. I certainly enjoy more my life in Europe esp France (I do speak french!).

Even though I just basically started my job this week and just left France less than two weeks ago, I knew exactly what I’m gonna be facing for the rest. I experienced the same thing after my masters in another EU country. The salary in my new job here is actually good but I just don’t feel comfortable at all with my personal and work lives, it makes me stressed and anxious all the time! Waking up in the morning to go to work feels so dreadful.

I think I’ll start applying for other jobs in EU esp. France hoping that it will be successful this time :(

1igt1sn,I suspect that someone’s been using my bed,"I am currently a sophomore right now and I have a new roommate who’s a transfer from spain this semester - my old roommate is studying abroad.

I usually go back home on weekends to work. I never had an issue with it for the past 2 years with my old roommate. But when I came back last night I found it a bit weird
When I left friday night, i didn’t really make my bed- I was really stressed over an essay I had due that same night. All I did was make sure the blanket covered most of my bed at least


However, when i came back, my blanket was made perfectly, with even the excess folded on the side of the wall (my blankets a queen sized comforter) 

I really don’t know if it was my roommate or her friends. or someone else since she leaves the room door wide open in the suite the entire day , it’s part of her culture 

I don’t know if i should say something now or wait until this weekend and take pictures of my side of the room before I leave to check if it’s different.
I’m scared to bring it up and be wrong & have an awkward semester with her

bjo5wy,[Serious] post-match suicide,"So I just found out about the suicide of a medical student that didn't match this past year.

It's not the end of the world. Medicine is not the end-all be-all. it's a good career and I'm glad I went into it, but it's really stressful and it should not be the reason for anyone being stressed out to the point that they want to take irreversible measure is like jumping off a bridge.

1fir20o,"Is it normal for a professor to not allow students to leave for anything, even the bathroom?","I have this nightmare where professors don’t let us leave the classroom for the entire 2 hours. If I want to step out for just 5 minutes for any reason, they would mark me absent for the day. One professor even locks the door, so if anyone wants to leave, they have to interrupt him, which is really, really awkward.

In my first 2 semesters, I almost didn’t qualify to take the final exams because my tummy always acts up when I’m stressed, and I get anxious every time I see them.

I thought I only had to endure this for 2 semesters, but in the next 3, the new professor acted exactly like the last one, except they didn’t lock the door this time. It’s driving me insane. I just need to use the bathroom for 5 MINUTES during their 2 HOUR class.

What’s worse is that the school doesn’t have a rating system, so I’m stuck with these ridiculous rules until I graduate, which is another 3 semesters.

(Funny rumor I heard is that they are married to each other.)

Update: (tldr: problem solved but i hate this place)
Hey thanks for all the replies, so turns out it’s really not normal. I thought I was being dramatic.

So I have settled with the solution that I’ll have to go to class earlier than normal to do the business. Many suggested I talk to the admins, but I think the issue seems too trivial for them to take it seriously. They also love to play passing the ball with “oh they are from another faculty, so it’s another faculty problem, you should go to them, not us.”

And most of the reply kinda like this: “Everyone knows they do be like that, some has tried to report, but things still haven’t changed. Maybe try not to be late next time?” 

I agree this matter is not worth all that hassle just because something so embarrassing like this… Besides, it seems that no one else in class has any trouble with it. But, oh god I paid for all this?

179guv5,Has anyone noticed an increase in students oversharing stress/trauma/etc. when asking simple questions?,"I've noticed that a lot of the emails and meetings with students I've had begin with some kind of info dump about their personal stresses, struggles, etc. While this is understandable in some contexts, such as if they're asking for an extension on an assignment, I'm seeing it in places it really doesn't make sense. For example, if a link on turnitin isn't working, they don't just email me saying ""hey, the link isn't working for me."" It's a paragraph about what a rough week they're having before they state the link isn't working. It doesn't just happen with students I see face-to-face, but with my online students who I don't have much of a personal relationship with. 

Are they afraid I'll be mad at them for reaching out, so they try to placate me by sharing their own stress?

Is it that they don't know how to separate their current feelings (I'm already stressed and this is making me more stressed) from the actual information they need to convey?

I've seen a few post related to choosing between CMU SCS and Harvard but I wanted to ask about my specific case since I'm stuck.

I was pretty dead set on choosing CMU SCS, specifically its intensity and being filled with insanely smart peers who would push me to do better and excel in CS.

But recently, I landed an FAANG internship. Knowing this, my parents and everyone around me have been pushing me to go to Harvard because

1. I already have a big internship under my belt, so ""I don’t need CMU's rigor to land jobs""
2. Harvard’s prestige would open more long-term doors since they're convinced I'll be replaced by AI  or lose my future job
3. I could still take tough technical courses at MIT through cross-registration
4. I would be less stressed (?)

I'm not a big fan of Harvard's CS classes and prefer CMU's. However, I feel that if I choose CMU, everyone around me would be really disappointed. 

I visited both campuses and I liked both, which didn't really help me in deciding. Money isn't a problem for either school.

1iebam7,I still have nightmares about PhD after a decade,"Today YouTube showed me a video about a recent PhD dispute in the Netherlands and it gave me flashbacks.

10 years ago I was a naive recently minted MS, entering a mid tier PhD. I already had some internships, research and TAing under my belt. I didn't think it would be hard or bad at all, beyond the technical aspects. But I was wrong. Yes, the technical aspects are hard, but what is truly hard was the political scheming and extreme workplace hostility.

**It was horrendous.**

I witnessed some of the worst abuses I've ever seen in a workplace. Just as an example, I've seen a grown woman from my institution, break down and cry in the stairwell at a conference when she thought nobody was looking, due to the extreme stress and mistreatment. Socially it was a nightmare too as everyone was so competitive or stressed that making real friends in the program was extremely difficult, and not for a lack of trying.

I was forced out even after passing quals for the simple mistake of asking a (scientific!) question that offended the PI's favorite postdoc, and for that I got put on the PI's shit list. I don't think I offended the PI directly because he barely answered my emails with 1 word answers and literally shows up for work 2 days a week. Hard to offend someone with minimal interaction. 

He told me that my proposed research was of low value (despite him and my entire committee signing off on it as part of my quals) and that I was unsuited for research, and that he would not let me graduate with the PhD. To prove his point, I got put on projects solely validating other people's work and taken off RAships. I was put solely on TA. I tried to switch groups but got sabotaged by the PI every time. I reported this to the director of graduate studies who was sympathetic, agreed I had done nothing wrong, and yet did not lift a finger to help me. I could neither move forward, nor turn around to a different direction, so the only path left to me was to quit.

I came in with a MS, I left with a MS and some more instrument time. In the end the value came out to be \~1 years of job experience post-MS without the pay. I left into a tough job market and my first job out of grad school was on contract, no insurance, low wages. I was living with multiple roommates I didn't know in a converted 'single family' home in the ghetto working 10+ hours a day. Yet I was happier because at least I knew I would not be working on contract forever.

I'm doing much better now and actually have a research job, but to get here was a long path.

I am planning to get married to my long-time boyfriend next year and I will be taking a quarter off for the wedding. 

Recently my mother-in-law brought up the baby question (🫨) just checking how long will the PhD take after we get married. She mentioned that conceiving after 30 becomes challenging and there are complications for both baby and the mother. She’s really sweet and she told me this out of concern – my mom has also brought up this conversation before. 

I want kid(s), alright; but the fact that I will have to conceive after my PhD and by then I will be close to 32 is driving me nuts. Like how have people in the past done this! I am afraid if I conceive before my PhD, it will push my academic career even further. And conceiving after my PhD will complicate the pregnancy?

I don’t know what to think at this point but please any kind of reassurance or reality checks appreciated :) Or just a story of how did your first pregnancy go during/after PhD.

1jqvaki,Advice needed: professor and others say I shouldn't apply to go to grad school in fall 2026?,"Hi everyone,

I have one more semester left after this spring! I can't believe that my undergraduate degree is almost over. It feels like just yesterday I transferred from community college to a 4-year college. Everything is going well. I'm graduating with little debt, but then I was given a scholarship and a grant that covered all my tuition. No more undergrad debt, yay! 

It's coming to an end now. I have one semester left and I would start looking over applications for grad school, but I had a 1-on-1 with my professor that might change my plans. I told her that grad school is the next step for me. My undergrad degree is in sociology, and it's heavily mocked for being worthless/useless without more school. Those comments do shake my confidence, but I tried business and economics, and I didn't fall in love with it like I did with sociology. My professor told me that I can find a job with my BA in sociology and I definitely shouldn't attend grad school in fall 2026. Since I graduate in December, I will get the spring and summer to myself. She told me to use that time because I need it for myself personally and as a scholar. There's more to it as well, like I have two part-time jobs, and an internship right now. I'm a little tired and stressed, but I simply won't give up. My dad is a single parent, so he needs help. When I told her that, she told me that it's time I start figuring out what I want. She told me to permit myself to do/choose what I want first, and give myself time. She also suggested I see the therapist at school. It was nice of her. I almost cried.

I told my boyfriend, and he agreed. He told me I've earned myself a break, and that I can use this time to adjust to a life without school. My sister says university won't be my life forever, and there are other important things in my life.

I just feel a little lost. I've never taken time off from school. I'm always on the go and busy, as my family says. I'm used to it. It sounds stupid, but I'm scared to have that free time. What if I don't go back to school? I also worry about what's going on in the US right now. Is it the wrong time? What if the program I want to be in is no longer there? What if I end up wanting something else besides grad school?

k0xkv8,"How I won an academic violation case, and how you can too.","**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\_said\_i\_hacked\_into\_his\_computer\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on a Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. I was so stressed that I couldn't even eat properly. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These were the questions I thought about 24/7, and sadly, my parents couldn't answer them.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this  even while my case was pending.

**RESULTS: I WON THE CASE.** After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**If you actually cheated and got caught, don't even try to appeal your case. It will most likely fail and you'll end up digging yourself a deeper hole, and the consequences for your academic violation could be even worse if you lie about it! Colleges hate liars and you'll make things even worse for yourself by appealing the punishment. Please don't risk getting expelled for something like this. Own up to it, learn from it, and move on. And stop cheating!!**

**BUT if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least. Start drafting your appeal letter, or prepare what you need to say during the hearing.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and locate any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics. I even went to review sessions for exams and asked my professor a ton of questions on topics I didn’t understand. Remember that it is your right as a student to have your questions answered and your work graded while your case is being reviewed.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!**  Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong. Here's some good advice from someone who commented on my old post: **""Some rando is not going to ruin your academic career unless you allow them to""** and I agree with this 100%.

Sorry for the long post, but this is what happened. I won the case and I'm going to take my final for this class in a few weeks. It was stressful, it spoiled my semester, but I learned a lot from it, especially how to defend myself, even if it's against people who have power over me, like my professor. I know that as a future doctor I'll be getting a lot of false accusations, threats and lawsuits from patients, and honestly, this situation has slightly prepped me for all of that!

It's sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Don't think that your college will just side with the professor since they have more ""credibility"", that's not true. **Yes, the process is extremely frustrating and stressful, but the process is not unfair.** Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, though, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say. Yes we all make mistakes, but if you cheated and you're punished, accept the sanction and move on. That's due process being served.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost, friends.

1kqjobi,"Got ghosted mid-call by a  clown ""startup"". I'm done working for anyone else’s dream","Just had an “interview” with a so-called startup team that turned into a full-blown circus.

I’m a freshman. I told them up front I’m still learning, no bullshit, no ego. I came in clear about my level, hoping for real collaboration, mentorship, anything legit. You’d think that’s what a startup wants: hungry, upfront people who want to grow.

Instead? One dude peaced out before the interview even finished. Another was texting or note-passing like it’s fucking 8th grade homeroom. Then comes the cherry on top: “I just feel like you may not be interested in the rest of this call...” Nah bro, you just couldn’t handle that I wasn’t fake-laughing at your awkward vibes and lowball pitch.

1ja11gb,Student Evals & Tenure,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

To say I'm stressed about my student evals would be an understatement. When I taught a lecture class (aka two 75minute classes per week) as a graduate student, I had excellent student evals, despite stricter policies.

I'm 2.5yrs into my TT position at an R1 university, and my ratings for this semester hover right around the lower 3s (on a scale of 5). For the last two years they've been in the higher 3/lower 4s.

I personally have zero problem with this rating. A 4, after all, means ""very good"" for crying out loud. Yet, every year it is prominently noted on my review how far below the department average I am (which apparently is ~4.6). I'm also constantly being told how important student evals are for tenure. 

Just this week, I collected unofficial midterm feedback and it's high 2s/low 3s. Note that this class is very heavily focused on guests speakers, so my actual lecture time for a 3-credit class since the beginning of the semester has probably been 4, maybe 5 hours. The longest lecture (where I just talked), was 1 hour, everything else was 20-30 here and there.  Number 1 complaint: "" lectures are too long and not engaging enough."" Never mind the fact that when I solicit opinions and try to engage them, I  basically just look at 30 faces who just blankly stare back.  Number 2 complaint: ""the professor is a harsh grader.” Average assignment grades are usually in the low 90s (or high 80s depending on how many people didn’t bother to submit). Make it make sense.

I want to emphasize that Im personally okay with this rating. Students get out of their education what they put in. But because my department/college puts so much goddamn emphasis on student evals, I feel like I am doomed. Im in the social sciences, and our dean is riding that ""empathy"" train super hard. 

I think all of my policies are fair and reasonable, and account for some unexpected circumstances that might come up. They're not different from those of my colleagues, assuming they're not straight up lying to me. I don't have data on whether or not or to what extent they enforce them, though this might be the problem. I think it is important to be consistent and predictable and barring the most unusual circumstances, my syllabus is written such that I can point students to it to let them know what policy applies to their situation. 

I'm not even mad at the students. Honestly, they're just trying to get by doing as little as possible. I'm just so frustrated that I work in an environment where leaders acknowledge that those who enforce their policies with students systematically get lower ratings and yet they still use it as one of their primary metrics for evaluating performance. I feel disheartened that my teaching ""only"" being considers ""good""-to-""very good"" is going to hurt my chances for tenure. 

Tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

Rant. Over. 

Edit: took out comment about gaming the system and handing out As because too many people took it too literally. It's a rant, though advice would still be appreciated.

I’m the kind of person who gets excited about learning and wants to share the cool new things I’ve discovered, but it feels like she doesn’t care.

I’m starting up M2 year soon and I just feel really stressed out about it — I’m just so scared about what lies ahead. 

In M1 year I spent all my time studying all day everyday and recently I’ve been increasingly stressing over starting again because everyone says M2 is even harder.

I just wish I could be more efficient with my time, and actually have free time for my own life. I wish I could see friends more, have fun for a moment, etc. 

My strategy has been to watch lectures and review PowerPoint slides. With such little time between weekly exams, I don’t know what else I can do. I need like 3-5 passes through something for an exam. Sometimes it feels like I don’t even have enough time for that. In addition, I feel like I have no free time, no time for hobbies, and I have to give up my entire social life again because it feels like every waking moment has to be spent studying. 

I just want to stop worrying for every exam and I really want to focus on AnKing and third party resources this year. It was hard to do that the first year because of anatomy and physiology, but this year with micro, pharm, and path I really hope I can utilize AnKing. I’ve  really come to hate in-house lectures. It feels like my studying (reviewing PowerPoint slides) isn’t efficient since I’m spending all day doing it, but with my school’s frequent exam schedule sometimes I have no other choice. This constantly stresses me out and I really feel like it’s taken a toll on other aspects of life. I feel like I’m the only one struggling. 

I don’t know how to change this. I’m just not looking forward to M2 year.

Since you’re always the new person on the team, you don’t always click socially w everyone. Each rotation, you’re never sure if the attending likes you, until you get that 3 out of 5 eval despite trying everything possible to fit in. Not to mention, you’re a mildly awkward med student w no time or skill to date.

Then your senior gives you a compliment. It’s something small and benign like, “good job w that presentation”. Oh my goodness?? In a world in which everything has been a struggle, someone thinks you’re not messing up. Over the month, you mentally latch onto this person. You crave that positive reinforcement. Your senior says to go help w this task, and you eagerly jump at it because they might recognize your efforts and you’re having compliment-withdrawal-syndrome. 
You’re now sleep deprived from your schedule, stressed about your shelf, and your mind is playing emotional tricks on you. Your senior might be the only thing motivating you to wake up and go to rotation. If you’re on surgery, when that surgical field gets small and the lights get hot and you brush shoulders in the OR - oh it’s actually over. Remember, you’re a touch-starved med student and the only thing holding your hand has been your Anki remote. 

And that’s how it starts. But now you’re an M4 and have recovered from the mental struggle called third year 😭",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mcmpir/the_psychology_of_developing_a_crush_on_your/
1b531cs,Doctor's notes and missed exams,"Can we all agree to stop asking for doctor's notes for missed midterms?? Half the time when I got a note it said the person was feeling anxious and stressed and that is why they are missing the exam so it doesn't really stop those who just didn't study. It's a waste of a doctor's time, and if they are sick with a virus, they are spreading it to all those people in the waiting room for no reason when the person should be at home getting better.  To be fair, I think we should scrap doctor's notes for everything (missed work, needing physio for insurance etc.) and just believe people.  Will the minority use it to their advantage? Sure, but the waste of medical resources is not worth fighting the minority.

1jyphcj,Got an internship!,"Just wanted to share my process a bit. I was honestly being really lazy and didn’t grind as much as I should’ve during fall semester. Didn’t leetcode, thought it’d just come to me. Then bombed some OAs and realized I wasn’t a leetcode genius. Come winter break reality set in so I was grinding everyday. Got Amazon and Google OAs, but didn’t lead anywhere. Then I started actually mass applying for internships in January. Didn’t get interviews or anything until mid February, and I thought I did well on one, so I stopped applying to places, waiting on that one place. Didn’t get it, big mistake. I was feeling really hopeless and honestly cried a couple times lol. At one point I was so stressed and needed someone to talk to I had to go to my school’s psychological services. I applied to my school’s unpaid internship program and research positions because I was convinced it was over because it was already April. But then I finally got my offer and I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. And honestly I didn’t think I got it either—I had to send a follow-up email to my recruiter (I thought if I had to send a follow-up, I probably didn’t get it). But he called me after and said the offer email was stuck in his outbox lol. And here I am! I do wonder where I’d be if I applied myself more during the fall semester, but we move. I’m no genius either, had a research assistant position and volunteer developer role on my resume, along with one pretty basic? full stack project on my resume. I don’t think I have a moral of the story or if there’s even a point to my spiel, but just wanted to share in case anyone is in the same position I was. Things will work out!

For my thesis I sent out a survey and I just realized I wrote about the wrong sampling method in my thesis, that I actually used another method entirely. My supervisor said that i've done a census, but another professor who specializes in statistics said that it was more like a voluntary sample. I ended up writing that I did a voluntary sample, because that's what I honestly thought based on the sources I had, but I now realize that I may have misunderstood them and that my supervisor might've been right. 

  
I feel so fucking stupid and tired. This thesis is 13000 words of horseshit. I don't know how I'm going to survive my presentation. I'm so stressed that my stomach hurts.

1mwa8zi,Why does everyone make a big deal about getting a PhD if it is literally just another thing to do in life?,"Hi everyone, so I’m coming here with something I’ve been thinking about for months. So I am a second year PhD student in structural and computational biochemistry, I would say I’m having quite a nice experience, I like my project, I have a very prestigious scholarship, I have a good relationship with my PI…. But sometimes when I talk with other PhD students, or even when I see some posts in here I feel like people make too much of a deal about getting PhD. Let me explain myself:

So while I do think getting a PhD is something great, you know, becoming an expert in an area that you probably love, potentially having professional opportunities because of this… it is really just another thing you do(?) I feel like sometimes people make their whole personality about being a PhD student and getting a PhD, and stress way too much when in the end is just another thing to do in life. 

Idk in my case, of course I work a lot, I have to come to the lab during some weekends etc, but I honestly do it because I want to, but it is not my entire life. Sometimes I speak with colleagues and all they seem to talk about is their work and how they imagine their thesis defense day, and again… is just another thing? I felt the same while doing my bachelors and my masters defense, it seemed like everyone was making a big thing out of it and in the end both times I wrote 70% of the thesis in 1 night, got a good grade after the defense and that was it, don’t see what the big deal is.

Anyone else feels like this? Just felt like sharing this because sometimes I even feel bad about not being more stressed about my PhD. Sometimes I also see people here asking “am I good enough for a PhD?” And I’m just thinking “wtf?” like why do people even question that?

tofj3w,Student scheduled honeymoon during final exam week and wants exam early,"Student scheduled a 10-day honeymoon which will span the entire final exam week (and part of the prior week).  She will be back from her honeymoon after the end of the semester.   No mention of it until this week.  She contacted me to let me know about this and to ask me what my plans are to allow her to complete the semester so that it won't interfere with her honeymoon. This is a 100% asynchronous online class.  

It was all I could do not to ask her why in the world she would plan a honeymoon during final exam week.  After all, we don't just spring that on people.  It is the same week every year.

1as90i0,Student Irate - Syllabus Failed to Specify Number of Exam Questions,"I am an adjunct who teaches asynchronous online courses. I have no idea how this happened, but I apparently omitted the number of questions on my exams in my syllabi this semester (40 MC, TF, and FIB questions in 50 minutes). The exams are worth 40 points, so each question is worth 1 point. Although grades have not yet been posted, a student is absolutely irate that they were unable to complete the exam in the time allotted. The exams are open book/open note, but I do make it clear that students must have sufficient comprehension of the material mindful of the time limit. Still, the student is arguing that they were ""set up for failure"" as my syllabi imply that they will have time to ""look up"" answers. Based on the performance of the class, I suspect I may have other students who are not pleased. I am so very stressed as I cannot believe I made this error. How should I handle this?

**Edited to Add:** Thank you all for your comments and guidance! I do specify in all of the exam-related materials that, while theoretically open book/note, sufficient comprehension is necessary mindful of the learning objectives and time limit.

The student contacted me after the first exam and indicated that they expected a poor grade as they were distracted for a significant period by their child during the exam. After being unable to complete the second exam in time, they sent another email indicating, ""you set me up for failure"" and ""I know my complaints mean nothing to you."" They are also questionning why I do not have the ""People"" feature enabled so that they can contact other students and set up a GroupMe.

- I am pursuing my PhD while working full time
- Passed quals last year
- Have published some of my research 
- I don’t want to be a professor, but I do like to work in research but this is where my full time job is already 
- Advisor is wonderful and untenured

I am struggling with:
- Have had issues with motivation since I passed quals, has gotten progressively worse. I dread doing anything PhD related
- I feel like I am wasting my life
- I feel like I am doing a bad job at work and with my relationship (married)
- I don’t feel any passion for my field anymore; it is interesting sometimes but mostly I feel stressed when I think about it
- I hate publishing and presenting 
- One of the other PhD students in our lab failed quals and was dismissed, so I feel like if another of us leaves it will impact my advisor’s tenure chances, and I really don’t want that because she is really wonderful 

Things I have tried:
- Talking with my advisor: let her know how I was feeling about 4/5 months ago, she said we can slow things down and she has been flexible and kind
- Taking a break from classes and research

TLDR: I love my advisor, i don’t want to screw her over, but i am so so tired and not feeling passionate or motivated to continue this and feel like i am just wasting my life

tcsm49,FIU: Perfect Medical School Run by Angels,"Dear Reddit community, 

There has been a lot of undeserved, false and horrendously unprofessional falsehoods levied against one of our nation's oldest and most prestigious medical schools: The FIU Herbert Wertheim School of Medicine. These unprofessional lies tarnish both our school's incredible reputation as well as that of our namesake, Dr. Herbert Wertheim, an outstanding optometrist physician.  I would like to share some information about our school to showcase how wonderful, happy and satisfied our medical students are and how nice and empathetic our staff are.

Our school is frequently described by our students, interviewees and alumni as a ""heaven on earth."" Everybody is content and happy, none of our students are stressed out, we have some of the nicest/most professional faculty out there, our administration is known internationally for how much they care about the medical students, we have no legal troubles, do not unfairly punish students (or punish students at all), and never silence the beautiful, angelic voices of our diverse students. In addition, all of our students are able to progress easily through all 4 years with no unfair delays in their education. Anything stating the contrary is FAKE. 

First and foremost, FIU prides itself on the happiness of and diversity of our medical school class. Check out these pictures of our happy, diverse medical students:

[We mail EVERY one of our students a deluxe care package every month shown here.](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/e3aScreenShot20220312at.png)

We also have the world's most beautiful campus: seen [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/36dScreenShot20220312at.png) as well as some of the most modern and most world class medical facilities seen [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/e82ScreenShot20220312at.png). 

Our faculty are known for their kind treatment of medical students. In fact, we've won INTERNATIONAL awards for how well we treat our students. See the prestigious award we've won [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/f60ScreenShot20220312at.png). 

We also frequently seek and respond to feedback from our students. 100% of the feedback we receive is positive. A sample of student comments can be found [here](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/a4cScreenShot20220312at.png). 

We have also NEVER publicly shamed a student; all allegations alleging the opposite are fake news. Also, none of our students are working for Uber or wait tables. 

Our school has been [praised](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/2cbScreenShot20220312at.png) by the LCME for how well it is run and for how amazing we are. 

Finally, there is a super fake version of a hearing transcript leaked by an unprofessional student. Here is the correct version! [Click here for the non-fake version of the transcript](https://u.cubeupload.com/FIU_Deam/146ScreenShot20220312at.png)

In summary, FIU is best medical school in the world and has the happiest students and kindest faculty and administration. All allegations are fake, there is nothing malicious or malignant going on at FIU. Everything is perfect and everything is beautiful. We are not run by the “mafia;” we are run by angels. Please consider joining us in heaven.

11e836r,Heartbroken and seeking clarity,"I figured I post here because I was lurking on this subreddit for a while to learn and saw a lot of posts about the difficulties of relationships.

I was in a long-distance relationship with a med student and made an effort to understand her busy schedule. I even browsed the subreddit every day to learn and understand. However, the lack of quality time together basically caused me to have attachment anxiety. I slowly addressed what I needed so I didn't cause unwanted pressure. I even mentioned that I had a lot of free time so whenever she was free and wanted to chat, she could call and FaceTime whenever. Eventually, when I didn't get anything, we had to schedule it instead. We did manage to schedule a FaceTime call once a week, not enough, but it was better than going months or weeks without one like before. We even spent time together in person during winter break and there was no sign of anything wrong. All was good until she had to move back because of the start of the semester. Again, I tried to understand and thought I could take it temporarily because classes, matching, and boards were causing her some major anxiety and stress.

A couple of days before, she seemed aggressive and mean through text. That continued the next day, and she seemed quieter than usual, so I asked her why she was quiet and if everything was good (my anxious attachment acting up). She lashed out again and told me that she was dying from studying, as usual. It just felt like she was saying I didn't understand her without saying it directly. Like I knew she was studying but just wanted to check up on her because it was causing me anxiety. I did something similar months before, but it was not as bad, and we clarified the misunderstanding because it is really hard to tell through text. Then the breakup text came right after.

The breakup came all of a sudden because even though she had told me how much she was stressed, she did not communicate the potential of a breakup. The reason she gave was that she could not meet my needs even though it was the bare minimum. She said she was too busy and anxious after the second semester her M2 started.

I have been struggling to accept this as the reason because I feel this is something we could have talked about before at least. Even if I did something wrong or it was me I would like to know so I can fix these issues. I didn't even get a call, and it was all via text. No chance to talk it out or anything because I just accepted it at the moment. We never had any arguments before, and she never mentioned anything that she felt was wrong in the relationship. I even asked her to communicate anything that bothered her to me because all I wanted to do was support her.

Even after the breakup, I did not argue back and just thanked her and went no contact. I do think it's best for both of us to have this space, and she can focus on med school and boards without unnecessary drama. I am just extremely hurt because I wanted it to work and gave it my all. I tried to communicate as much as I could but never got that in return.

I know this is just my side of the story, and I am not going to contact her until she reaches out to me, which I feel is not going to happen ever for some reason. I feel like I was suffocating her in the relationship even though I just wanted basic things and communication. I want med students' opinions on my story.

Note: I went down this rabbit hole about attachment theory. I saw a lot of anxious attachment in me, while I saw a lot of avoidant behavior in her which is causing me to not accept the reason she gave me.

TLDR: Med school GF broke up with me because she did not have time for me, and I am confused about the real reason because of a lack of communication. I am going no contact for my healing but want answers from her.

Edit: Thank you for the kind words. I am on the right path to recovery and getting back out there. I know relationships don't work sometimes and it's okay to break up. But it's the way it ended that left me hurting.

Edit 2:  I am already working on my anxious attachment. I never had this before and a lot of it probably came out because I felt like I was not getting my needs met. I should have addressed it sooner but I was afraid.

Edit 3: I have come to the conclusion that she felt that the relationship was not worth it for her and ended things. I know she does not owe me anything including talking, giving a reason, or anything. I simply need to move on and let go of hope. Thank you, everyone, and good luck.

Edit 4: I have no hate against anyone in this. I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings. Maybe I was too lovey-dovey and smothered her too much. I just did what felt right in the moment.

Edit 5: I learned that we might have been trauma bonding. I ignored my needs and put hers first. I realized that I made some mistakes where I sometimes blamed her for canceling on me frequently or not getting me what I wanted. I will further explore this with my therapists. I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I was not aware of. I will try to learn from them and fix them.

Final Edit: it’s the next day! I have slept with everyone’s comments. I understand that sometimes relationships don’t work because of a lot of different things. I need to stop overthinking and move on. Thank you again!",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11e836r/heartbroken_and_seeking_clarity/

See your family! (Unless they’re toxic, in which case substitute with friends/ whoever your support system is) Even if it’s virtually. Seriously, I went to med school with so many people who put grades and all else above the people they care about. Your qbank and anki can take second place, even if just for a few days. If something happens to you, no one will remember your grades or your drive to match peds orthocardioneurosurgery. I promise y’all, I never looked at a grade or score and regretted time I spent with ppl important to me. Come residency, you could be halfway across the country and/ or working holidays. People remember how much effort and time you put into them, and I’ve heard too many residents talk about feeling isolated because they lost relationships along the way. Happy holiday break guys- make it count!

1jjdlao,Family wants me to build their app idea that will totally blow up,"So this whole situation makes me a bit queasy for a reason I can't put my finger on. Looking for advice

Basically the gist is that I'm a cs major, and my mom has been running a failing small business for a long time now, making probably around minimum wage and living off welfare. The small business is failing because the market is terrible for what she's providing and it's not scalable. She's often remarked that a waiter would make more than her.

She's been looking for a big break for a while now. She took a scammy online course that teaches you to make online courses and apparently people all over the world will just buy and it'll be passive income and she will finally be rich. My mom latched onto this idea. Since then for years she's wanted to make it into reality--however, she has no idea about ""all that tech stuff"". So she wants me to build her platform, a website and an app, use ""AI or something"" to edit her videos, and then use ""SEO or something"" to advertise on ""the facebooks"", and then she will be rich. She has promised me handsome compensation of somewhere south of minimum wage if she can get an ""investment"" from a rich relative. Says the experience will be worth it alone for young people like me but the money is just an extra bonus.

Needless to say idk about this idea man...I think even if every other step succeeds, the course itself will not sell. My mom has 0 experience filming or selling courses. But also the relative I don't think will want to invest and she might burn the relationship which she really values. And she has also done no work on her side, she doesn't even have recorded videos because she's waiting for an investment from the relative as an ""angel investor"" so she can pause her business and take a few months off to just record videos. Which I think will be the final straw for her actual business. 

On my part, I think I'd also rather work at starbucks...I think I'd make more working for starbucks for less hours. But more than that I don't want to be there running her whole business only for it to flop. I am stressed just thinking about it.

But needless to say this is an extremely sensitive subject. All her hopes and dreams. She doesn't gamble but this is her lottery ticket.

1mv7no5,Grad school vs living life,"I start my second semester (but first in-person “real” semester) of grad school for clinical mental health counseling next week and I’m really struggling with whether or not I want to drop out. I think I’m going to give this semester a shot and then decide, but I’m curious what others think about this.

My program won’t have me graduate until May 2028, and then it will be about 2yrs for me to obtain licensure (so 2030). By that point, my partner and I will probably be trying to have kids. I feel like the licensure and job opportunities might be worth it, but not before I’m in my like mid to late 30’s (I’m 23 almost 24 now).

I work full-time and already struggle with being stressed and feeling like I don’t have enough time for things in life. I struggle with my own mental health and always have (I’ve gotten a lot better, but still have a long way to go).

I’m worried that grad school and licensure will completely take up the next 5+ yrs of my life. I will have truly zero time. I will be stressed and miserable. I’m considering dropping out in order to pursue other hobbies and passions and just finally live a peaceful happy life.

But then again, I do find the field incredibly interesting. I’ve had my heart set on it for years now. I’m worried I’d get bored with a 9-5 job forever and the convenience of schedule and pay that a lot of therapists have is great. I’m passionate about helping others and have had a few jobs that exposed me to the field. I think I’d enjoy learning a lot of the stuff I’d learn in grad school.

But I don’t want to tough through it and then look back in 5 years and regret all the time I spent grinding instead of enjoying what are supposed to be some of the best years of my life. I put a lot of pressure on myself to achieve more and be something and my pride may be getting in the way. Idk. I’m worried that I’ll regret my decision either way.

Anyone else feel like this?

I was born in East Asia, fucked up my college entrance exam and went into an average university. Wasted 4 years(or should I say 21 years) and got a bachelor's in financial mathematics.

I wanted to leave that country and never look back, so I'm graduating soon with this master's of data science in a T500 university in Canada. And just yesterday, I got this Econ PhD offer from the same uni, with the research area being some combination of ML, Fin and Econ.

I'm happy, that I don't have to worry about incoming recession and brutal job market for the next 4 years. I'm also happy that I can spend time on studying a discipline that I'm interested in and research on topics that attracts me. I want to make the most out of this experience and grow into a better individual, a better me.

Meanwhile, I'm also worried. I don't think I deserve it. I do have a great average, but if they test on me, they'll find out that I hardly remember anything. I know stuff, but I constantly question myself ""do you really know about it? and all the math&theory behind it?""

I'm scared, stressed, anxious. I heard all those horrible stories of doing a PhD, all those physically exhausting, mentally draining experience. I don't know what to do except relearn those things I've learned years ago again before the degree starts, which is pretty much my daily life right now. I try to occupy every day so that I don't have time for anxiety.

I don't know what is waiting for me in the near future, and I don't see where the path leads to after this degree ends. I genuinely appreciate any guidance and advice. Thank you all for reading this nonsense, and I wish you have a great PhD experience.

_____________________________

We're all barely keeping it together, student and teacher alike.  Among my students, almost no one wanted/expected to be distance learning this semester and, consequently, very few are possessed of the self-regulation and discipline necessary to succeed in an online course.  We're a small community college in an area that's far from affluent so I know many of my students have been struggling to access computer resources.  I know of a few for sure who are working multiple jobs and coming home to find out the one family computer is not available.  

And I know that while I'm doing my best, I'm not at my best.  I'm sure I've missed things. I'm sure I've docked more points than reasonable on an essay somewhere along the line because I was stressed or annoyed. I'm sure I've written a ""bad question"" that I didn't catch.  I'm sure I've not been a great online professor because this is my first fully online semester.  I mean, I think back to my first year teaching and now and the difference is obvious so I know I'm not at my best in this new digital venue.  

And there's also the fact that I have zero desire to create/score an extra credit assignment.

So, what harm do you think I'm doing?  What drawback do you see?  Keep in mind that my classes are non-sequential and do not serve as prerequisites for anything.  Yes, there are some who just do not deserve it.  Yes, it might take several students who truly deserve the F/D they would get otherwise to a D/C.  But I think that's reasonable.  I expect the class would perform about 10% better if we were face to face and past class data certainly suggest this.  

If you think the idea is a good one, when should I tell them?  Before Thanksgiving?  Before Finals?  Not at all and just let them be surprised?

I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how “gracious” he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won’t be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless. I felt berated.

o7ctqj,My top tips for starting PhD students,"*NOTE: I left this as a comment on a recent post, but it was big, so I thought I would just post it, for anyone to read...*

A few things you might like to know if you're just starting your PhD.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Never work weekends, unless you *have* to, like if you have a deadline or something. Even then, do absolutely everything you can to meet that deadline during week days.

Honestly, you're better off doing an extra hour each weekday than working weekends (although even that should be avoided at all costs). Especially in the last 6 months of my PhD (I'm submitting *today* fingers crossed! -- let's quietly ignore the fact that I'm on reddit), I found that taking weekends of was not just good, but necessary. I was way more productive during the week, I kept my personal life together and helped kept the house a nice place to live, got to unwind and relax, which are extremely important at the end when you're super stressed.Work as hard as you can during the week, but take the weekend off, unless you absolutely can't (which is probably wayyyy less than most people think).

Now for the more tough love advice. Depending on your field, I dunno if thesis by publication is common, but if it is, do everything you can to get at least 2-3 papers published. You will absolutely thank yourself when it comes times to write your thesis.

Write drafts as early as you can, and get lots of help and feedback. If you're supervisors don't give you feedback as often as you like, find someone who will. ***Heed my words. Feedback is one of the single most important things you can do for your productivity***. Everyone says this. It's 100% true. Can't stress it enough. Get feedback as much as you can, from anyone who will give it to you.

Sometimes feedback is icky, but in the black hole of PhD productivity and progress, getting feedback gives you constant benchmarks for progress, and gives something *concrete* to act on. There's nothing like the feeling you get when you accept a change, or make an edit, and watch the comments bar in your word document disappear, and you're done.

Also:

* ~~Try to...~~ Read(!) at least one paper *every single day*, all the way through, don't skip stuff - this will get easier the more you do it. (pro tip: print them out, go to a cafe or park, and read them, take nothing but a pen and highlighter - the trees will forgive you)
   * UPDATE: Some very helpful comments have come in, and pointed out that in some fields, this is just virtually impossible. Some papers take days to properly read and understand. So I thought I'd elaborate a little
      * The point here is that you want to make a consistent, daily habit of pushing yourself, and straining your understanding, maintaining familiarity of your field. Even if it takes more than a day to read a paper, the goal is not being passive or shallow in your literature research, you want to really learn and understand your field, and the more you challenger yourself to do this, the more your confidence will grow - *I promise you*
      * Obviously you don't have to read every single paper this way - there's just too many papers, but you should make the effort to have a consistent string of papers that you properly read and understand
* Try to read several PhD theses (I wish I did this in my first year) - you can usually find them in your University library
   * Read some from your own institution, close to your field
   * Read some from elsewhere
   * Find some that are as close as possible to your work
   * You don't necessarily have to read them all the way through, but get a really good picture of the breadth, and variety of thesis out there, the formatting, length style, etc. You might be surprised to find just how different they can be even within the same field.
   * It's so much easier to write your thesis, when you know what it's supposed to look like
* Make friends, hangout a bit, volunteer (but not too much)
* Trust your supervisors - if you have a good relationship with them, and work with them, *they won't let you fail (if you have a* ***bad*** *relationship with them, you should talk to someone about it, someone who can give you good advice about what to do in this case - your supervisor is your lifeline and the single most important factor in your success)*
* ***Don't give up! Your PhD is 95% persistence - show up, everyday, and do something, anything, and you'll get there***
* Read these things:
   * [https://amberdavis.nl/worst-nightmare/](https://amberdavis.nl/worst-nightmare/) (not as scary as it sounds)

   * Kiley & Mullins, 2002, 'It's a PhD, not a Nobel Prize': How experienced examiners assess research theses
   * Golding, 2017, Advice for writing a thesis (based on what examiners do)
* UPDATE 2: Oh man, I can't believe I forgot this the first time - *have regular meetings with your supervisors - this almost single handedly saved my PhD, and got me finished on time*
   * If you struggle even a little bit to meet deadlines, or push yourself, then I highly recommend having regular meetings with your supervisor - every 1 or two weeks",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/o7ctqj/my_top_tips_for_starting_phd_students/

vxcoow,Does anyone feel like they are putting their life on hold for grad school?,"Maybe I am just feeling exceptionally negative today, but there are times where I feel that I am putting personal, financial, and overall life goals on hold because of graduate school. I am almost 27 and my boyfriend and I have been talking about getting married and buying a house, but it feels like everything has to wait until I'm done with school. I'm in no rush, but I hate that everything has to operate around my internship and post doc plans. Everything feels so calculated and forced into specific timelines instead of happening naturally. Even smaller things like going on vacation feel impossible sometimes because of the lack of time and money I have available to me. Even when I do take time for myself, I feel extremely guilty. This process just feels like it is creeping by and sometimes I feel like I'm wasting a majority of my 20s (and by the time this is done, early 30s) being stressed out, broke, and stuck. I know it will be over at some point, but it feels never ending. 

On the flip side, I think (hope) that once this is all over, I will feel a large sense of personal fulfillment. Sometimes I hear my friends talk and complain about their jobs feeling meaningless.

10bdhul,The freshman were NOT prepared for Calculus 2,"I'm a TA at a top 10 engineering university in the USA. I was a teaching assistant for Calculus 2 last semester, leading (compulsory) recitations for students to supplement the lectures. The content was completely normal Calculus 2 material, from integration techniques to infinite series. Students needed a calculus prerequisite to take the course, and the majority of my students were first semester freshman (because it was in the Fall).   


I am somehow ashamed to say that the majority of those new students were completely unprepared. There were some - perhaps 35% -  that were anywhere from average to great students. But the 60-70% of students were greatly behind to completely lost. Of course I had students who struggled with derivatives as in most semesters, but these students clearly had a complete lack of practice with them. So many could not answer a single ""nontrivial"" derivative question (""What's the derivative of 2x\^2?"")  completely correctly. More students struggled with exponents, not to mention basic trigonometry. Fundamental lack of algebraic skills. Sadly even some of my good students struggled frequently with both simple conceptual and computational questions. The questions that they did the best on? Memorizing ones of course, and only when the question is written in the exact way that they memorized. Oh and cheating, lots of it.  


I could go on, but the real reason I'm posting is because of a dilemma I had. I had many (seemingly) diligent students that were going to fail. These students showed up during recitation, went to tutoring resources, reached out to me asking for more tutoring resources, and went to every one of my office hours. After a few hours of interaction with many of these students (and students from other recitation sections who joined in my university-public office hours), the best advice I could think for them is to immediately drop the course, begin reviewing precalculus, and then enroll in Calculus 1 in the next semester. These students were significantly stressed out with terrible grades (some literally not breaking double digits / 100 on quizzes or exams), had no actual course specific skills, and asked the most fundamental attribution error style questions.  


But I am just a teaching assistant, how could I recommend a student drop the course? It just didn't feel right to do that, yet they were destined to fail (and they got the grades I predicted, many Ds and below). I was too busy with my own studies to reach out to the professor(s) and ask them for advice because I was afraid of being completely brushed off by them (as they are even more busy than me).   


I don't know if this matches any one else's experience, but I think this is the closest place to share. It is very frustrating, but maybe this semester could be different for me.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/10bdhul/the_freshman_were_not_prepared_for_calculus_2/

Especially considering the rise in AI, which has not made the ongoing situation any better. My current university uses those similarity-detector tools, I’m worried one day it’s going to flag something I wrote as “AI-generated” or “plagiarized”. 

There’s always a camera in the room when I test (disability accommodations, I take my tests separately from the class), and i’m always worried someone’s going to be monitoring me and think I appear suspicious or think something on my calculator looks like i’m cheating.

1n0pr71,"How to switch into ""receiving constructive criticism"" mode?","Hey everyone! I just got a position in a grant-funded PhD, starting in a few months. It is pretty much my ideal placement (interesting, productive and relevant lab, PI whose research I'd been following for a long time, interesting prospects for a project, even a city I most wanted to move to). 

Only problem: 
I worry a bit about how well I will manage the potential stress and relationship to the PI. I spoke to a former PhD student from the lab, who was overall satisfied with his time there, and didn't say anything outright negative, but I got the overall impression that the PI can be quite demanding (or, in his words, ""not one to give much emotional support, and he will give you a lot of revisions"").

A rundown of what I heard about the PI:
+ can make a lot of resources available to you
+ is quite rational and can be convinced if your opinions differ
+ appreciates direct communication, doesn't ""play games""
+ doesn't expect you to be able to do everything instantly

- most likely demanding
- will give a lot of revisions and will point out things that are wrong with the project (can be a plus if done in the right way)
- I have heard that he had some conflicts with PhD students in the past, although am unsure of their nature

I'm not naïve and I've heard horror stories about overly critical supervisors and the stress related to it all that can ruin peoples' lives, pretty much. I know also that most people will point to the relationship with a supervisor as the thing that can make or break you during a PhD. 

That being said, I am determined to try this position, as it is quite perfect for me and my career prospects (also, it may turn out I'm worrying for nothing); and am also determined to approach it with a positive mindset and not let anxiety or self esteem issues get the better of me. That being said, I am feeling a little apprehensive, because I can anticipate being potentially stressed out by this type of supervisor.

Now, to the point: 

- What are your ways of dealing with a demanding or critical supervisors? 
- How do you manage to switch into ""constructive criticism"" mode and not criticisms affect you emotionally? 
- How do you remain calm and not freak out about expectations placed on you?
- How do you provide positive feedback for yourself if your supervisor is not one to give much, and remain balanced?

I will appreciate any and all tips - however, I would appreciate if people refrained from advising me not to take the position, as I am already well aware of the risks, and determined to try in spite of them. I am only looking to improve my emotional regulation skills needed for dealing with these types of situations and for remaining positive (emotionally resilient?)

Like I said - the PI being terrible is sort of a worst-case scenario that I hope will not be the case, so wish me luck! :))

have a nice week and good luck in your projects!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1n0pr71/how_to_switch_into_receiving_constructive/

I’m just not sure I feel “academically satisfied.” I know I could have done more in my LD, but I was too nervous and stressed. If I really wanted to I could take one more semester at cc and transfer to my local university to save money and do what I want. Their applied math program is honestly underrated. I would like to open up more doors rather than stay on the social sci path. I like the social sciences, but I my true passions don’t lie there.

1ilta08,Massive mistake in old MS research,"I just found a massive error in the data collection methodology from my Master's research from 2019. To preface, this research was my first ever real research experience and was definitely a learning curve for me. The methods were super shaky as this was work only me and a postdoc were doing. It was being funded by a pilot grant in collaboration with another lab. Basically we had to build a barrier model that the collaborator lab would use to test toxins, and I had to take specific measurements using electrodes to ensure that the cell layers inside the model were intact. Honestly maybe there are more advanced methods to take these measurements now (not sure as I have since moved on to another research area) but back then I remember really struggling and the whole thing feeling kinda sketchy, like the layers of cells in the model would be disrupted constantly or electrodes would break. Looking back I also think the base conditions of my measurements besides the controls were a little off (potentially incorrect flow rates and cell conditions). I did not publish this anywhere - the conclusion was a poster presentation (not a thesis) at a university symposium for master's students. 

Anyway, I was looking at my old data and I realized as I was looking that I have used the same blank value for every measurement batch across different batches of devices, which obviously doesn't make sense...I looked at my protocols and apparently I had the same 'control' device across every new batch I made, which doesn't make sense at all. So the control number was just the same. 

Basically, I do not trust this data lol. And that would be fine by itself as I know I'm a MUCH more competent scientist now. It doesn't seem like the project has continued in the lab  after the pilot money ran out. Me and the postdoc left the same year so we've been gone 6 years now. However, I am nervous that this data will be used by somebody else someday, either for a future grant application or just to replicate.  This error isn't obvious at first glance, as it's a methodological error. I found out by looking at the data analysis.

Now, my old advisor obviously has all this data. I'm not sure if I should contact him after 6 years and tell him I made this error, or if I should just let it go if it hasn't been picked up by anybody else since then (that I can see through his ongoing grants and the lab website). I'm also assuming he would look through the data analysis before using the data, and come to the same conclusion that the control is the same value for every batch. I don't want him to think I fudged it, I honestly just didn't know any better at the time...

I'm hoping he was stressed about the particular situation and he'll calm down and see I'm being reasonable, but there's always the chance this will happen again. And if he's like this with me--again, a guy who could take him on in a physical fight--I worry he may be worse with women.

Anyways this is the background info i had no one to room with at the college I chose i was scared of having a random roommate so i knew a few friends also going to the same school (4 hours from my home town) so when they asked me to room with them i said yes. Im going to be a freshman and out apartment is 1 block off campus but its still student housing just not dorms. Anyways my friend today who is friends with them as well said good luck bro (well call him mathew) one of my roommates who’s very (rich and spoiled) told me he’s gonna mess with you for a week straight and see if he can make you leave. Now im not sure how many people can relate but they are the type of friends to say that and not mean it just to mess around but now im nervous incase he and other roommates do try stuff i dont want it to interfere with my life plans (college, work) i work from home on the computer and often have video calls and chats.

One thing im scared of is that hell say offensive things or be blasting loud music on his dj set and board hes bringing down and this could get me in trouble with work. Another fear of mine is him stealing from me or going into my room and messing with my things. Another fear is him taking it to far and harassing me by touching me and throwing things at me (we always would joke around but I’m scared he might take something to far) another fear of mine is he has a fake id and i don’t want to be in trouble if he has drinks or vapes in our room

1mmtm88,First year of med school and I already feel burnt out…,"I’ve just started my medical journey, and I’m already tired.
I spent two whole years just to clear the MCAT. Now that I’m finally in med school… I kind of hate it.

Homesickness doesn’t help either.

I’ve always been more into creativity. Here, everything is about cramming. Even when I find topics interesting, the interest disappears the moment it’s time to memorize everything for exams.

There’s barely any time left for hobbies or fun.
24 hours feels too short to do everything. And if I miss a day’s work, it feels impossible to catch up which just sucks.

I hate going to uni because it feels like a waste of time; I hardly understand my teachers, though YouTube helps a lot.

I don’t even know what I want anymore. My whole life, I’ve had to put in double the effort because I’m not naturally gifted. Now I don’t want to live my life like this forever.

Whenever exam season comes, I get super stressed. I start having anxiety and I can’t stop crying.
I’m crying while writing this.

In my country, our year is divided into 3 blocks (each around 3–4 months). We have almost 3 tests in each block. Whenever these tests come, I take so much tension.

I barely passed the previous block. I don’t even remember what I studied in it.
And I know at the end of the year, I won’t remember each and everything either.

The worst part is, I know I’ll have to put in double the effort not just for the next 5 years, but also for the USMLE because I’ve always dreamed of going to the USA. Just thinking about working so much for 5+ years feels overwhelming.

Right now, I just feel like a failure.
Sometimes I wish I hadn’t cleared MCAT the second time, so maybe I could have moved on (though I’m not sure I would have).

I don’t know what to do anymore.
I feel like my mind is going to burst any minute now.

If anyone has been through this stage of med school and found a way to cope  or if you have advice on how to manage the stress, homesickness, and constant workload please share. I’m really looking for ways to make this journey feel more sustainable.

I heard from many people that this degree is absolute because employers prefer real college degrees (Typically its 3 years) and university degrees. With what everyone is saying about that degree, I feel like I wasted my time, especially since we didn't go in depth into many topics so I'll have to compensate with extra research on my own time.

My real goal is : to build multiple saas (I have so much ideas + I have training in entrepreneurship), and also still be employable anywhere in the world in case that business don't work out.

My mom keeps telling/pressuring me that by the age of 30, I should be settled in life: that means ""Have a stable income"", ""a stable degree"", ""a car"", etc. That adds on to my stress.

I guinely love development, I'm excited when learning it, it brings me much joy. Plus, I excel at self-learning. But I heard the bare minimum worldwide is a bachelor's degree.

I was considering a SE degree (which is 5 years here) or a CS degree (4 years) to ensure I don't miss out on any knowledge I might need (even tho I prefer self-learning) to get a stable career and build my own apps, but at the same time the state of the tech job market scares me from pursuing this. I'm afraid of wasting my time again.

Because of that, I thought of getting a (4 years) bachelor in psychotherapy since that field seems more ""sure in the future"" and learn SE as a ""hobby"" on the side.

I'm at an intersection, I don't know what to do. This will affect my whole entire life and I'm stressed like crazy.

These are benefits I have to use sooner rather than be able to use them later.

Don't wait until you feel like you have no options.  Reach out - hell, you can get in touch with me directly if you need to.  I'll help as much as I can or help you find what you need if possible.

Remember, you're a doctor (or will be very soon).  You earned this.  You deserve this.  You CAN do it.  Those of us who already have are here to help.

1axok5q,First-year doctoral student- distressed and not sure if I can make it,"Hi everyone, I need to vent/express myself for a bit, and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and share their thoughts.

I was really excited for grad school. I think my advisor saw this, too, and we hit it off when I interviewed up to when I started in August. I sensed she was going to be tough on me, but I considered myself strong and disciplined, plus everyone supporting me said I had the work ethic to be a grad student. 

Fast forward to now, about a third of the way through my second semester. I've been crying just about every night for the past week or so. Mainly, it's isolation, but its also a loss in my sense of self, because I am NOT performing well here. At least, this is the feedback I've received from my advisor. I've been too busy to spend time with my peers to see if this is really the case, or if my advisor is being hard on me, and I am doing fine.

I am in 15 credit hours of classes. 1 hour is a 'pleasure class' which is easy. The other 14 were suggested by my advisor, and I am not allowed to drop. They aren't horribly bad, but it is just a lot of hours. One of the classes is taught my my advisor herself, and this is the most time consuming class of the bunch. I currently have a C in that class, and an A in the others. In a meeting with my advisor, I suggested an independent study to replace one of my classes and make it easier on me, but my advisor laughed and said I didn't work hard enough last semester to deserve a break like that.

I started a GRA this semester, expecting it to be a lighter load than GTA, which it is not. My advisor is requiring 20 hours a week of lab work, and since I am a first year, none of the samples I am working with are mine. I am not allowed to start processing my own samples or counting my lab hours towards personal research because my advisor is not satisfied with the research questions I have yet. To be fair, my research is not doing well, but I feel like if I had more time to dedicate to it (as opposed to 15 hours of classes + 20 hours of work), I could achieve this.

I have an office but I only ever use it for storage, because if I'm not in class, I'm working in the lab. I go home at 6 or 7 most days, cook food, shower, play with my dog, and then start crying, usually. I know I should be using this time to work on my research so I can finally make some progress and have a shot at graduating eventually, but all I want to do is go to bed. I am not even that sleep-deprived, I just can't cope with the thought of mentally exerting myself all day long. 

I receive passive-aggressive texts from my advisor or my lab manager often. Usually every other day.  And I think they talk behind my back, because I will notice they will allude to things that they weren't there to see, so they must have heard about it from each other. I don't think this is in my head. I used to admire them, but now I feel tense around them. They monitor my hours in the lab closely and have expressed annoyance at weeks where I am only able to complete 18-19 hours of lab work, rather than the full 20.

I don't know what to do. I'm enrolled in therapy at my university, I am eating well and sleeping enough. I do not have friends to spend time with, and departmental social events don't usually work with my schedule. I called my mom today to ask her what she thinks about me moving home.

I just know if I give up, I will not stop thinking about research. This was my dream, I made it, and I feel like it's changing me, and not in a good way, and I do not feel comfortable here. I regret not picking the other school that made me an offer. I wonder if I drop here, if the other school would take me, or if my chance at a masters or doctoral degree is gone.

I am an international student and the new skilled worker visa rules that say i have to get at least 38,700 pounds as salary  to get sponsorship will be making me harder to get a job and thus stay in UK ( my plan was to be a research assistant first before going to lectureship but it looks like those roles wont be sponsored anymore due to the new rules).

This is my last semester in community college before I transfer as a junior to a university, and I just... Cant cope. I'm the first in my family to go to college so no one thinks this is difficult, nor do they care that I've worked hard to keep up a 4.0 through the last 48 credit hours. This semester is supposed to be all electives but it's genuinely the most frustrating college experience I've had.

I've had breakdowns nearly every other day over my classes this semester or from the content in said classes. It's grating me physically and emotionally. I don't even have any interest in my usual hobbies anymore. I've tried self care and I've tried modifying my homework schedule so it wouldn't be too heavy of a load, but nothing seems to work.

17g07nx,How do you fight stress and overwhelm when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel? I'm a Ph.D. student with a full-time teaching job and anxiety and I just CAN'T,"I  have just finished my Ph.D. studies and the only thing I have to do is  to finish my dissertation, however, I feel like I just cannot do it  because I'm so stressed, exhausted and anxious all the time, plus I  don't really have a lot of extra hours to work on it. I'm teaching at a  university full time where I have 5-6 courses (depending on the  semester) plus all the extra work that comes with it -- supervising  students, administration, and random extra work. I also became  responsible for an extra project a month ago which me and my co-workers  have to work on every year: it comes with tons of emails, administration  and project management. The problem is, I have quite severe anxiety and  I'm also a perfectionist, so I tend to stress way more than necessary  -- which makes me really exhausted and I simply cannot focus on my  dissertation. I'm trying to find a way of working smarter and not  harder, but simply working for the university is enough work and when I  have some free time (which I don't), I'm either focusing on my  relationships or I'm just too exhausted to work on my thesis. My problem  is that I'm totally exhausted, I cry and/or have an anxiety attack  almost every day, and I feel like there's no end in sight -- I will only  be able to have a bit longer of a resting period between Christmas and  New Year's Eve, and then I want to focus on writing in January so that I  can finish this d\*mn dissertation because not being able to finally be  done with it ruins my mental health.

My  question is: how do you keep going in times like these? I hate that the  only thing I enjoy about my work is the actual teaching part of it, but  researching for the lectures and seminars and dealing with all the  other stuff is just stressful and I don't want to do it anymore. Do you  have any tips for how to have more mental energy to just do the stuff I  have to do? I stopped reading emails on the weekends (though I usually  have to work anyway, otherwise I just can't cope with the workload) and I  try giving myself tiny breaks throughout the day but that's usually  housework because I have to do that as well. When I didn't do this, the  house became a mess by the end of the day which made me overwhelmed and  anxious which was a lot worse. I could work in the evenings (which I  don't do anymore) because I'm usually with my partner or I just do some  self-care but I did it before and it always came with a lovely mental  collapse, which I'm not doing anymore.  I'm also going to therapy every  week which used to help but my therapist couldn't really help me in the  last couple of weeks because she insists that I should just do my stuff  and stop caring about it, but I can't. I've already started to  experience the side effects physically (strong headaches, tummy issues  and an aching back) which made me realize that I really have to do  something about this situation, but I have no idea about how to change  things.

zkh662,TW- medical issue /addictive medication. I'm in pain and scared,"Hi All,

I started my PhD a couple of months ago and things were going well. Earlier this month I started getting a flare up of my sciatic pain (started in 2020). A few weeks ago I ended up in A&E because it became debilitating.

My PI has told me to heal and rest and I am speaking to a consultant this week to discuss my MRI. 

What is breaking me is the fact that, in addition to my pain and exhaustion, the university has been awful about helping. I only need a temp blue badge while I wait for a legal one but they want me to pay over £150 for a permit for the year that MIGHT get me a space within a quarter mile of my office (I can't walk that far) but they aren't sure if they can upgrade it to a disabled permit.

I've been told I can apply for help to pay for it but I need to spend several hours filling in forms and finding the evidence. In addition, I have to reveal all of my financial info to a stranger to judge and justify any payments over £100 in the past 3 months.

The official blue badge will poss take months to get IF they approve it.

I have also been prescribed opiates and I am terrified of addiction but I can't cope with the pain if I don't take them.

Assessments are designed to assess your understanding of a topic. They can be rough around the edges, particularly if you are an undergrad The academic language can be wanting.

4twjhu,Should I take a year off to feel more in control with my own life?,"Hey guys, I feel very conflicted right now as I don't feel certain about going to university this September anymore. 

I initially planned to take out an educational loan to go to a UK university to get my engineering degree. Although the interest rate is only 3% per year, I need $120,000 to cover everything from food to tuition fees. There's a possibility of it turning into a full ride scholarship if I get good results. However, what if I can't cope in such a different environment? What if I don't like the uni I'm attending? And what with Brexit and them trying to decrease immigration, I feel like I'm throwing my non-existent money away before I get to even keep it.

The thought of taking a year off and using that time to get a driving licence plus a job seems so much more attractive now. I just don't feel ready to fly to the UK and start university yet.

i5wwgw,Achievement and Worth,"Hello,  


My name is Sean and I'm about to graduate with an AAS in electronics and communications systems. With one quarter to go, I received a certificate in the mail unexpectedly. It was an accommodation for having made it onto the president's list for my performance during Winter 2020. While at first I was ecstatic, the effect wore off quickly. Due in part to my college administration reaching out to invite me to an exclusive celebration for president's list recipients this year on Zoom. I was intrigued, to say the least. In another world, where the later part of my college days did not coincide with a pandemic, I imagined a black-tie, cocktail gala in the convention/conference theater at my campus. Mingling and meeting, drinking and dancing, speeches and solemn handshakes.  


Of course, you all know what a Zoom meeting is like, so I had to put that fantasy in my back pocket, so to speak. I was also asked to be the student speaker. I'd be given a three minute time slot to say whatever I pleased. I asked what I should write about, and they had no guidelines. I pondered that speech all week, and nothing came to mind. Until the day before, when a university I was considering transferring to informed me that they do not grant scholarships to transfer students. It reminded me why I went to a technical college in the first place; it was the only place where I had a true shot and being an independent and successful adult, whose career was not a burden, and whose wallet was not burdened by debt.  


I found the words to write my speech. Now, all I had to do was wait for the clock to strike one. The faculty opened and introduced the celebration to all attendees before sharing their own speeches. They were full of energy, excitement, and praise. I nervously await my name to be called. I hadn't known it at the time, but I was the *only* student speaker. My speech represented all of studenthood, to be extreme.  
Three minutes and a ruined t-shirt later, I concluded my presentation and was met with a heavy five seconds of silence. The director of campus life activities thanked me for my vulnerable statement before moving on. You see, my speech was an introspective lament about my time throughout college. I name dropped the instructors who had proved instrumental to my success, and who were amazing people in general. I also expressed what I mentioned here--no other institution would have granted me the financial support and academic tailoring. I was soon embarrassed as I realized how out of tone my presentation was in relation. At that point, I was just happy to be out of the spotlight.  


Well, folks, we've arrived at the point!  
In my speech, I stated that I am not the smartest nor the most affluent individual out there; that I'd struggle in most other degree programs, within and without. Sure, I have the 4.0's and the 3.9's, but I'm not an engineer or a neurologist--i'm just an electronics/comms technician. I don't feel the 4.0 in my mind. I'm just really good at this one thing.  
This goes beyond a simple case of impostor syndrome, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this. The most shiny and special thing about me is that accolade and my grades. It's what makes people's ears perk up. It's the thing that my parents can brag about.  
It's the only part of me and my accomplishments that receives any recognition.  


And it means nothing.  


I know that all the 2.1ers out there are cringing as we speak, but hear me out. Being put on a pedestal for something like that casts a shadow over everything else that makes me, me. I look down and I wish I could take that light and shine it over there. Being a true scholar doesn't help me build meaningful friendships or find contentedness in my spare time. Rather, I'm just the go-to guy. The poster child. And unrelated to academics, the person guys just wanna bang.   


""Oh hey, I've got this problem with my car/bike.""  
""And this is Sean, he's really smart. Oh, what's that? She did what? I gotta see this, sorry man.""  
""Hey cutie \*dick pic\*""  


I should feel proud of myself for how far I've come--and I understand that we're here to start a career-but I just feel like no one sees me anymore, you know? There's so much just under the surface that people either don't see, or disregard.  
Call me crazy, but what's the point of this journey if you're going it alone? None of the friends i've had in the last eight years have ever wanted to talk or spend time with me. I've always gotta be the person to arrange and instigate things.  


I've struggled so much to get here, but all I have to show for it is a piece of paper with my president's signature on it. I'd trade that for a 3.0 and one great friend anytime. I guess I can't cope with being on my own like this.

Im a college student somewhere in Latin America, Im not sure if your exam systems are the same as mine because for some stuff its quite different, but for my career most subjects you can pass without a final exam if on both previous exams you have a 7 or more for semestral subjects, and on the three previous exams for anual ones.

Please can somebody give me some advice?,"I'm Australian and the way the system works here is 3 year undergraduate degree, 1 year honours degree (a research year where you do a project and write a thesis) and then after that you can either do a PhD (3 years) or masters (2 years). I went the PhD route. I went straight from school to undergrad, then did honours, then on to my PhD without taking any sort of break between those things. Which, in hindsight, was a mistake. However I didn't think so because I loved research. My undergraduate degree was in biomedical science, which I loved, then my honours degree was in neuroscience, which I also loved. I thought I was totally ready and willing to do a PhD. I thought I'd love it.

I don't.

My project isn't really working and I don't even care why. I just go to uni every day, do my time in the lab, then come home. Everybody keeps telling me I need to join the student committee, get a tutoring job, stay up to date with big conferences I might be interested in going to, look for scholarships I might be eligible for, don't get behind in reading the literature...on top of actually doing experiments. I know this is normal everyday PhD student stuff that everyone else seems to cope with really well. But I can't cope with any of it. I want to tell everyone to shut the fuck up because just going to uni every day is bad enough without having to do all that extra stuff on top. I want to quit.

Now, this is where I need your help.

I have absolutely no idea how to quit, or what will be available to me if I do. Ideally I'd want to get a research assistant job, because I really like science - I just think I made a mistake jumping into my PhD too early. Would it be possible to quit, work for a while, then start a whole new PhD in a few years? Would research groups even still take me on as a research assistant? I don't have any job experience because (idiotically) I listened to my family and focused on doing well at university instead of working. I didn't think that would matter because science doesn't care about your prior work experience at the supermarket, but it really does matter, and my resume is pathetic. 

The other option is just completing my PhD and then trying to get a research assistant job. I don't know whether that's a good idea or not though, because I know some labs won't hire research assistants with a PhD.

I'm trying to find a guidance counselor to talk to about this, but my department doesn't seem to offer one. So until I find somebody...please help me? What are my options?

1cuetx,College vs free internet education,"I've done near 6 years of formal college, the past two of which have been at a highly respected university (Fordham). Nearing the end of my tenure as a professional student, I'm really starting to appreciate the viewpoint of these ""skip college"" entrepreneurs / millionaires.  
  
Case in point: My ""faith and critical reason"" core requirement.  
Not only does it commit the crime of trying to push the concept that a god or gods exist, the professor who is head of her department (ethics or similar) insists on spending half the time block talking about outside project / her personal life/ what happened on the train today. When I asked her to concretely outline her requirements for the term paper on paper or online, she accused me of not being able memorize her every word.  
  
In general I ask for written requirements for any project that takes more than 5 hours of my life, school or work, so that when they come back with a you didnt do it right or F/D/C letter grade I can have firm footing to stand on. I had gotten a D on the midterm, though it may be due to my explanation of faith as what people do when they can't cope with no control / understand of their environment.  
  
This is par and course for the majority of college classes I've taken; I particularly detest the ""write a 5+ page term paper"" ""You'll learn something important"".  
  
So ""You'll learn what you're interested in"" seems to the truest statement so far; I've learned far more online based off leads and concepts introduced in passing by my professors than I have from the $50,$100,$200 text books I have sitting on my shelf. The overall problems with free internet education I see is the inability to prove to a future employer you are trained in a wide variety of skills, and the inability to get those little insights/ideas that separate a pro from newcomer.  
  
Proof  
Street cred  
  
Solve these and we could get rid of the college system for the majority of people.  
I know at most colleges you can pay to test out of a course, but the tests are written by specific instructor, and if you haven't taken classes from them, you have no clue what they will test on (My favorite color is?).  
This goes against wanting to learn / get those insights; its simply checking off a box which in the long term does not benefit you as a person.

In the interview, did he ***seriously make the argument*** that DO school is somewhere you go if you ***""drop out of a Caribbean MD?""*** As if DO is not only a backup to dropping out, but even less of an option prior to the Caribbean? This is supposed to be the guy who brags about doing his 'due diligence' for every joke, right? Does he even know that pretty much 99999% of CMDs don't even make it past first year because many are moneyfarms that don't require an MCAT (or bachelor's) to attend?

Maybe I'm just a little extra angry because I still haven't gone to bed yet and it's 7am, but..

#Holy shit, man.

**I'm just peeved**. I'm tired. I'm just sick of it. I'm sick of the lack of overall awareness on how medical education works - many could make the argument that none of us know how a lot of other graduate programs work, but AT THE VERY LEAST, the **TWO (not just one)** board-licensed physician practicing degrees in the US should be given recognition. Having to defend my education to virtually every person I meet? Like, seriously. I'm only an M1, but I don't study a billion vitamins and steps of collagen synthesis just to be called a Chiropractor, RC Cola, or anything else but a 'doctor.' 

Mid-level vs physician confusion is so rampant that I've had dialogue with people like: ***""Oh, where are you going? Oh, DO? Osteo? Is that Bone? Oh, Chiro, huh? So would you rather go to DO school, or wait until you can go to medical school?""*** Or even, ***""Oh, sick! You're going to medical school? Are you planning to be a nurse, or a dentist?""*** People think literally anyone and everyone went to 'medical school', but at the same time, nobody went to medical school except for MDs.

The number of times I've seen on Twitter & other social media where people will literally be shitting on DOs, saying that we **""didn't go to medical school,""** when there's LITERAL MDs in the thread defending them, is astronomical. And for some reason, even though the MDs are defending their colleagues, these dunning kruger neckbeards and Stacies will still try to correct the MDs and assert that DOs apparently didn't go to med school, and that they're mistaken.

**I'm just tired of the overall dunning-kruger of the laypeople in anything medically-related in general**. Like, I'm not even joking when I say this, but I can probably say with 100% confidence that NPs (and maybe even Chiros) get infinitely more respect than DOs. I can't imagine someone coming on national television and saying **""Dude, nurses completely overblow how much they have to do compared to doctors,""** or **""Dude, Chiro is voodoo magic.""** Even though Chiro can be very voodo-ey (which is also some of M2 OMM), people will still be Devil's advocate for it - but DO? OMM? It's always ""DO? What's that?"" Followed by ""Oh, so you went to Chiropractic school instead of medical school? Neat!"" I've literally seen Reddit threads where people get hundreds of upvotes trying to explain what a DO is, they go **""There is a subset of Chiropractors that continue their education and become licensed physicians, this is called a DO.""** And everyone nods their head in agreement, ***""Thanks for the clarification! That's interesting!""*** Like, what the hell?

And, dude. ***He said it on NATIONAL television. On the Tonight Show, nonetheless.*** Wow, cue millions of watchers now suddenly thinking all DOs didn't go to med school. We're all just Chiropractors. Not to mention when they post the clips on Youtube and every social media imaginable - it lasts forever. (There's actually already clips of it on YouTube - ***https://youtu.be/JrgQ0OMu-I0).***

Is that what the profession is? **Just the ass end of a joke by people who didn't even go to medical school?**

Am I the only person who finds it funny how many non-medical people there are in our society who die on hills trying to defend **""the honor of MDs,""** like, ***""No, I'll fight for you! I respect you guys! You guys went to REAL medical school! I'll defend you guys publicly by shitting on other people who claim to also practice medicine, I got you!""*** Lmao. Like, why are there so many laypeople who have the gumption to vicariously defend MDs and shit all over everyone else if they didn't go to medical school? It's like white knighting, but like, the belief is pretty pervasive among non-medical community members. Literally on Imgur when posting the image this morning, I got some comments from people who said ***""But [Hasan] is right, Osteopaths are all cultists and not even close to real doctors.""*** 6 upvotes. I and one other person call out the fact that this is not true. Downvoted into oblivion.

And then they use their Dunning-Kruger understanding to try to tell people why they're right, not even knowing that there are three VERY PROMINENT DOs from recent years in our society, yet still nobody knows about the degree outside of health care:

**1. Dr. Kevin O'Connor DO, PCP to Biden**

**2. Dr. Sean Conley DO, PCP to Trump**

**3. Dr. J.D. Polk DO, chief health executive of Nasa Corp**

Like, dude. **Like I said, I've been on Twitter or Groupme or everywhere and seen people claim DOs didn't go to medical school.** Like, ah, your ***cardiologist, anesthesiologist, PCP, psychiatrist,*** they all didn't go to medical school, huh? I see. Remember when Dr. Sean Conley was on TV talking about Covid? Politics aside, for some reason, it's very telling when everyone's first instinct was to attack his education and call him '**Not a physician'** just based on the word 'Osteopath' alone.

I'm glad there's a lot of people speaking up on the Twitter thread, at least. But the damage is done - like AACOM said, in a time where distrust of the medical community is already sky high and killing thousands of people, he literally just made it worse just to make a joke. You can see the thread here. It's a good read.

***https://twitter.com/hasanminhaj/status/1440373045726646274?s=19***

I swear. They seriously just need to amend the term **'Osteopathy.'** It literally translates to **'Path of the Bone'** which completely turns a lot of friends, family, and strangers off when you try to explain to them that you're a physician, not a Chiropractor or a voodoo magician. I just end up sounding totally insecure when I try to explain what it is (and I am, who would spend 11+ years just to be called a quack)? Why call it 'Osteopathy' when the definition really tries to extend to just amalgamating MD science/research education with some basic PT techniques and an emphasis on physician-patient relationship? When you pitch it that way, it actually sounds pretty damn cool. Let's change it to HD. So DO --> HD, the ***Holistic Doctor of Medicine.*** That way, we can practice in 720p. Or, shit, just call it the **""MDO""** or something. I don't know.

I know he's a comedian and all, but a lot of people treat this stuff as truth, especially the average Joe. I can imagine people at bars saying *'You heard of a DO? Man, just a bunch of people now who try to pretend they went to med school, huh?""* Especially after saying it on TV, and having immortalized on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JrgQ0OMu-I0).  At the end, he says ***'Shoutout to the DOs***' - oh, after you just shat on them to millions of people? Thanks, man.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pv62vt/comedian_hasan_minhaj_shits_on_and_discredits_11/
1ey49ej,Finally f#cking done,"**To all my fellow PhD students,**

After years of struggle, mental health crises, and—with an exaggeration—living on the edge of poverty, I’ve finally defended my thesis. I’m free.

If you haven’t had your defense yet, you probably have a lot of questions. Here’s a bit of what you might expect:

**Pay:** Yes, it’s as bad as you’ve heard. Despite earning an above-average salary compared to other PhD students in my region, I still made less than your average cashier. Without constant financial support from my significant other, I would never have managed. For that, I’m eternally grateful.

**Health:** I went from being a happy, healthy person to someone diagnosed with severe depression, taking three different medications daily. I’ve lost most of my hair, gained a lot of wrinkles, and put on 40kg. The toll on mental and physical health is real.

**Workload:** Absolutely brutal. I’m ecstatic to leave behind the 60+ hour work weeks. We often call it the ""system of falling shit."" Professors and associate professors rarely do the heavy lifting—that’s left to us, the PhD students. You’ll find little to no support from your superiors.

**Social Life:** Almost non-existent.

**Would I do it again?** I’d rather grate my skin, boil my teeth, and put my eyes in a blender.

**Was it worth it?** Yes and no. It was a unique experience. I had wonderful colleagues who supported me when I needed it most, and I formed some truly special relationships. Doing a PhD allowed me to dive deep into a topic I’m passionate about. I had opportunities to travel, explore, and immerse myself in what I love. But would I stay in academia? Absolutely not. The moment my defense was over, I couldn’t run away from the university fast enough.

Yet, as shallow as it may sound, calling my mom, boyfriend, and friends to tell them I’m finally a doctor—after everything they’ve done for me—was an amazing feeling. Even though I’ve decided that a career in academia isn’t for me, that moment made the journey worthwhile.

**TL;DR:** It’s hard. If it becomes too much, there’s no shame in dropping out. If you can handle it, there are rewards, even if they’re not what you initially expected.

**P.S.** Yes, this is a throwaway account.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ey49ej/finally_fcking_done/

Truth is, I’ve never been good at school. I don’t enjoy it, and I’m honestly scared I’ll fail classes and just end up wasting time and money. I don’t want to force a degree just to get a job I probably won’t even want.

The only reason I kinda think about staying is to be around people my age, meet girls, and not feel isolated. But is that even a good reason to stay in college?

Anyone here been in a similar spot? Would love to hear if dropping out worked out for you or if you regret it.

1lnudw5,Mid-PhD and it's looking like I've made a huge mistake choosing to do a PhD,"Coursework is finished, and I've been immersed in the research grind for many months now. It’s become clear I’m not naturally inclined toward this kind of work. I hate reading and writing papers, and I find myself savoring any break from my desk: meals, random chores, even the daily commute. Returning to the work fills me with dread. In my most recent graduate-level class, I got the lowest score on a research project.

If I continue down this path, I doubt I’ll become a superstar researcher. At best, I’d be average/mediocre—contributing papers that likely make no real impact on the field.

I sometimes daydream—seriously—about returning to the outdoor manual labor job I had in high school. Back then, life felt simpler, and my mental health was better. The idea of giving up research for something more grounded and physically engaging is more than a fantasy; I seriously consider it, despite the inevitable drop in income.

I’ve pretty much reached All-But-Dissertation (ABD) status. It will take only about 4 papers and a dissertation made from them to graduate. 1 to 2 more years would be enough time to finish.

I would appreciate your thoughts, even if it's only a few words. Have you (or someone you know) been in a situation like this and dealt with it well? With potentially as little as 1 year left, could dropping out and saving the 1 year of opportunity cost be rational, especially if I likely wouldn't even pursue a research job/career after graduating?

If you don't have any thoughts to share, at least send some digital hugs. I really need 'em right now.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1lnudw5/midphd_and_its_looking_like_ive_made_a_huge/
1jr3dk9,Dropping out of college,"
26F, CS major. 

Basically I come from an immigrant family who expected far too much from me. I had no “dream career” and no interest in doing anything. All these years I’ve literally been bullshiting my way to this point, it somehow worked out through high school and through my first few years in community college but this is as far as I’m getting. It all came at the cost of my mental health. Looking back I never really had a healthy mental state but with college I can certainly say it’s brought it down to rock bottom. I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I’m fairly certainly I have undiagnosed ADHD, bipolar disorder or depression.  Everyday was a fight. It’s fucked me up so much. Ive taken so many gap years, gone through a few major changes and got dismissed twice already and I’m about to be dismissed for the third. 

Apparently appeals after the third dismissal are typically denied and that’s understandable. Though there is one last option I have which is a “fresh start” program that I believe all colleges offer(?) but I’d have to wait for 3 years to reapply (and it’s only a small selected number of students) but quite honestly I don’t even know if I’ll even want to by then. I legitimately believe I’ve been traumatized, everything related to school just makes me miserable and scared. I can’t even look at a classroom without a chill running down my spine. And anyways, by that time I’ll be nearing 30 and the thought of that alone makes me want to end it all. My whole life wasted on nothing. Straight up a failure. I’m disappointed in myself. I feel pathetic, guilty, lost and i don’t believe I’m stupid but I definitely FEEL stupid. Point is I don’t have much of a choice now than to drop out. I could try to appeal again but if, and that’s a big IF I got readmitted, honestly I still don’t have the motivation. I have around 13-15 more classes to take to graduate but I just don’t have it in me to thug it out and try to finish them anymore. It’d be a stupid waste of money and time. 
Thinking about dropping out sounds freeing though. Almost makes me feel happy. I don’t mind it. As corny as this might sound i feel like I’ve been shackled my whole damn life and this is the one time I feel good about doing something but at the same time it’s terrifying. I keep having second thoughts…. Like what happens next ? What direction will I be going in life ? What options do i have ? Not to mention the biggest issue is that I can’t handle everyone’s disappointment. It’s too heavy for me. I genuinely don’t know what to do and I have no one to talk to about this",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1jr3dk9/dropping_out_of_college/
15vh5gr,How do I drop out?,"The title is my main question. I’m first-gen in the family to go, so all the pressure is on me. Who do I contact to drop out and how long does the process takes, and can they withhold you from dropping out?

My college starts this upcoming week and I plan to contact my financial aid department, my advisor, who else do I contact? My tuition is paid already by the financial aid department, but I’ve accepted grants (and the loans on accident) but I will not be needing them. They are not disbursed yet. Will I be responsible for paying those if they haven’t disbursed?

My mental health has been absolutely horrible for the past couple of months and I have always struggled with my mental health since I was young. I need to prioritize myself, it’s to the point where living is agonizing and I desperately need a break. I cannot afford to take on an extra workload and stress when it feels like I am constantly in a mental health crisis, especially nowadays. I have personal issues going on in my family that is taking a toll on me. I rather drop out, knowing deep down if I stay I’ll just flunk out. I really need a break, and need some time to rethink and come back when I am ready and more clear headed. There are multiple drop out dates but the later dates require a form. I plan on doing it the first week. At first I was excited, but when reality hit that I wasn’t ready and how bad my mental health actually is— I can’t stand the idea of college anymore.

I know my parents will be disappointed, but I don’t care because I feel like if I do college, I’ll lose myself more. I was pressured into college by my Highschool and parents. But right now, it’s not for me. I am certain that this is a decision I want to do.

I'm not asking for advice on dropping out of college or whatever either, because that is my next step if there is no way for me to pay.

I feel like this is a post I see frequently but I am struggling with the financial aspects of being a grad school student. And I feel like shit that I can never go out and do anything because all my stipend is spent on rent, utilities, bills, and groceries. While the rest of my cohort (which is 90% internationals) are always going to get food, coffee, or out to do something fun on the weekends. They will ask me to go but I almost always say no because I don’t have the extra funds for it. So I feel like I’m missing out and am not really socializing outside of the study groups I’m in. I cannot work a second job unless I want to give up my stipend and my parents can’t really help out because I come from a working class family. And I live with my boyfriend but he can’t take on extra expenses because he has his own financial burdens that are also putting stressors on him. I’m also jealous of my non-academic friends who get to go out on the weekends, buy whatever they want when they want, travel, buy houses, and get married. Because of this situation, I sometimes feel like dropping out of the program despite really liking my program and am really excited to do research.

Does anyone else feel this way? And what do you do to make grad school suck less? Will it ever get better?

1mqa3rw,Current MS2 that is dying to drop out. Are other options feasible at this point?,"There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t spend all my free time thinking about dropping out of medical school.

My passion for helping individuals with brain injuries started after I experienced multiple concussions in high school, but I’ve been open to different ways of achieving that goal. Becoming a doctor always just seemed like the most sensible route because of the high pay, flexibility to pursue almost anything, and authority that comes with the title. However, I knew what becoming a doctor involves, so before starting med school, I told myself I’d quit after the first year if I was miserable. Now, in my second year, I am indeed still miserable, but I still have no solid backup plan. I hate the stress, time commitment, and pressure of medicine, and I already have little interest in being a practicing physician. I’m not suicidal, but I’m deeply unhappy with my location, my lifestyle, and the lack of balance. The only joy I get in life is from weekend trips every few months (funded with loan money), but that's nowhere near enough to offset my day-to-day misery.

I still want a job that is intellectually engaging, allows me to make a positive impact, involves talking to people and moving around, and leaves me feeling proud about my profession. A PhD at this point sounds interesting but doesn't seem to make sense because it seems like the same level of commitment with a third of the pay. My ideal role would be leading projects to develop new brain injury therapeutics—not doing the bench work, but overseeing teams, managing progress, ensuring quality, and perhaps handling some sales. At the end of the day, I want a happy life where I can make a positive impact on people at work while having time to do what I love, without the stress of feeling like I’m shortchanging patients.

A big part of my struggle is location. I moved from my dream location—where I worked 9–5, lived near the beach, played volleyball, surfed often, and spent time with friends—to the worst place I’ve ever lived. My top five hobbies don’t exist here, the culture doesn’t fit me, and the social scene is basically nonexistent. My only friends here are classmates, but everyone is so busy studying that we rarely do anything, and there’s little to do anyway. I was supposed to spend the summer deciding whether to return, but instead I went back to my happy place to be with friends during my only time off.

My closest friends still live there, working under 40 hours a week and making $150–400k in software engineering or project management. Meanwhile, medical school demands so much that I haven’t even had time to find a therapist, though I think therapy could help me gain perspective.

**My dilemma:**

* **Stay** in med school for three more years in a place where I am absolutely miserable, hoping it leads directly to a well-paying, fulfilling role in my dream location—but risk wasting prime years 26-30 for a job I might not even want.
* **Leave** now, move back to the place and people I love, and work my way up over 5–10 years toward a leadership role—while accepting that I might never make enough to afford a home there. I also already have approximately $120,000 of loans.

I know leaving med school with just a BS won’t give me a cushy, high-paying job immediately. But staying feels like giving up years of my life for the sake of a path that no longer excites me.

I genuinely do not think that I am built for this while I'm working full-time (in an unrelated field also). I've never been the best reader and I'm expected to read like 200 pages per week, and watch videos, and podcasts, and THEN I can start my work. But all my work is due while I'm at my job so I will have to get it done the night before, which adds even more pressure.

I joined this second lab, and after nearly a year of work, my PI just says ""I don't think that this work is for you."" Apparently, because I have not been able to replicate some past findings from the lab, that means my bench work is not capable enough. Even though I have met all of his expectations, this is the only reason I am given. No amount of persuading could change his mind. Now, I am a student who has left not 1, but 2 labs during my time as a graduate student. The world is closing in, and I do not see a way forward. I was just getting my footing in the lab and finally gaining confidence in my ability as a researcher...and then this. 

I really don't want to drop out, but I honestly don't know where to go from here. Please, has anyone been in a similar situation that can offer some light?

Edit: Talked with the director of the program. They said my 3 options are to do an internship to get away from the environment for awhile, do another rotation, or drop out. The internship seems like a laughable possibility. It would highly depend if I even got in, which at this point I’m having doubts. Finding another lab is going to be difficult given that I have left two labs thus far. And dropping out…is the thing I have been afraid of since I got here, imposter syndrome and all that. Frankly, the conversation didn’t help. There is not much they can do. I feel I have tried my damnedest since I got here to find a good lab and get this damn degree. 3 1/2 years. And it may have been for naught.

Edit 2: Had a talk with my now former lab mate. In short, he agrees that I should give up wet bench work. He claims I make too many mistakes and ask for clarification too often. There is an argument to be had about how many mistakes is too many and how fast one should improve. But I don’t think that would help me here. This is concerning because my first lab PI made a similar claim to me about my wet work ability. Not sure whether to believe them since it’s coming from two sources now. I hate to think that all my effort to get good at science didn’t matter. My attempt in this second lab was me trying my damnedest to improve my ability. But I guess it wasn’t good enough. Thank you all for all your comments. It’s just disheartening to hear from three people now that wet lab research is not for me despite how hard I have tried.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/10rsxx5/just_got_kicked_out_of_my_lab/
1hgho3c,Reddit gives a bad impression of this place,"Hi!  None of you know me cuz I've never been here, but I assume Reddit overheard my interest in pursuing a PhD and ever since has been sending me recommended posts from this subreddit.  ~~Nearly every single post I was recommended revolved around whining and moping and complaining and killing hope before even getting started.~~

~~I understand having struggles, but the level of self-pity and crying I saw was absurd.  ""I'm doing a PhD and I'm miserable""  ""I'm doing a PhD it's not worth it""  ""I haven't started but I'm already thinking about dropping out""  I couldn't stand how incredibly pathetic this subreddit was, just complaining over and over and over and at a certain point I just thought, why are any of you even *in* PhD programs??  Do you not have *anything* to say but complain??  Do you talk about *anything* else??~~

~~I got more and more annoyed until finally, just now, I opened one of the posts and actually opened the subreddit, and what do I find?~~

~~This place is fine.  It's not perfect, but it's far from the echo chamber of pity that I was getting from recommendations.  There's people asking what it's like, making little jokes, talking about the attitudes of the subreddit and wider community.  Heck, the post that made me finally look at the subreddit turned out to be a joke (thank God, cuz ""I refuse to associate with non-PhDs"" really was the last straw).~~

~~It's not without its issues, and one of them does seem to be an issue of [overbearing] negativity, but not nearly to the level that Reddit's notifications led me to believe.  Given I'm very much a newcomer here, I imagine you all would know better than me: is that a problem of Reddit's mechanics, an indicator of an atmosphere that needs improvement, or a complete coincidence on my end?~~

~~That's all I wanted to say.  There's a strong chance I'll just fade back into the shadows after this, I just felt the need to say something at the least.~~

Edit: I rather unwisely used a lot of harsh language in an attempt to be semi-humorous, and it did not convey myself well.  In short: Reddit's recommendations gave me the impression that r/PhD was very discouraging for prospective PhD students, but when I actually opened the subreddit it wasn't nearly as discouraging as it originally appeared.  That's all.  Sorry for bothering you all.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hgho3c/reddit_gives_a_bad_impression_of_this_place/
1fncs6o,I wanna drop out ,"So I know a lot of college kids kinda joke around about wanting to drop out all the time, but I don’t think I’m joking. I live with 2 of my friends from high school, and I’m enjoying that. I enjoy going out and partying and stuff with my other college friends on the weekends. I just have zero motivation to do any school work, sometimes I just want to go back home and hang out with my other friends from highschool instead of going to class everyday. I’m seriously considering dropping out. The only issue is that I would need to find a job, I have a part time job, but I would probably need a full time job, or at least another part time job if I were to drop out. Then I have the dilemma of what career I want to do with my life. I’m currently in school to be a teacher but I’m already thinking that I don’t really want to be a teacher forever. I need advice on if I should drop out and find a job, or stick to school.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fncs6o/i_wanna_drop_out/
w94k76,Why don't more CS students take reduced course loads instead of burning out and dropping out of CS?," It seems that one of the biggest reasons students in CS suffer from burn-out and drop out is because of the heavy course-load of 5 or so classes per semester. Doesn't it make more sense to just reduce your course load so that you can potentially avoid burn out which probably leads to dropping out? It seems people have this ""all or nothing - do or die mindset"". I never understood this because I have friends who never even attempted part time course loads, they just went from full time to dropping out completely. Why?

EDIT: Did not realize the financial cost of school in the US. It’s like 8-10K here in Canada. It also seems like your scholarships, etc only cover 4 years. So makes sense for a lot of you to force it in 4 years",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w94k76/why_dont_more_cs_students_take_reduced_course/
1fe01zt,Is it normal to not have friends in college?,"I started college about 2 weeks ago and already am falling behind socially it seems like. I talk to people in my classes and got their info but haven’t spoken a word to them outside of class for plans and such so i just rot in my dorm all day. I also don’t have a roommate to be friends with either. And I haven’t had any success in the past few years building friendships so I was hoping college would fix that and it’s not. I feel even more isolated than I did in high school and I used to be that kid that sat by himself at lunch, or awkwardly asked people to sit with them. I’m not happy at all and am already considering dropping out because of how isolated and disconnected I feel from everyone around me, on top of a major I don’t exactly care about but am taking purely for the money aspect.

1lp987x,Should I drop out of university because of mental health? Advice needed.,"Hi, Sorry if this is long! I’d greatly appreciate if you took the tiime to read it.

I’m heading into my final year of uni after taking a mental health break, and I’m seriously considering dropping out.

I took a year off after a rough period—my mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.

For context, i’ve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I’ve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.

Since January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven’t been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I’ve tried everything—meds, structured routines, new environments—but I can’t focus or motivate myself. It’s like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.

Now I’m questioning everything. I don’t enjoy my course and can’t picture myself in a 9–5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing—especially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I’m terrified this would confirm it.

I want to get better, but I don’t know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.

Any advice or support would mean a lot. Thanks 😊",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lp987x/should_i_drop_out_of_university_because_of_mental/
e8de05,My parents are giving me so much shit for dropping out of college and doing something else. How do I deal with it?,"So college wasn't for me. I ended never showing up to class, didnt really care if I failed a test or project. Honestly, it never phased me because I just had no motivation or desire to be there.I would just work. Took me like 3 years to realize I didn't have to do what my parents told me too. Though part of the problem, I think, is that I stayed in my hometown for college. Saved money but still have like $30k in debt, but I digress. 


So I ended dropping out my junior year, crazy I know. But I was miserable. I couldn't take it anymore. My parents were pissed and dissapointed. I ended up joing the Marine Corps as an aircraft mechanic. Best job in the Marine Corps Btw.


Yeah, I dont make a lot of money. But I'm finally happy. I'm confident in myself and just feel great. I wake up WANTING to go to work even if it's only 4 am. I've made the best friends I've ever had and people I can count on.


The issue is, my parents dont even talk to me anymore. It's been like 4 months since I last went home didn't feel welcome. My little brother was the only one I can still bond with.

1ggfekk,Terrified that I screwed up life by joining PhD,"This post is going to sound super whiny just so y'all know I'm aware of it. 

I did my undergrad at a pretty prestigious school, did well lots of research etc etc was destined for PhD, my ugrad degree is pretty useless without some form of graduate degree. I joined a program that was a pivot from my original field, my research work in theory is supposed to be similar to what I used to do. But i absolutely despise this program, it gives me horrible anxiety and I dread getting up and going to class every day. My work is at the periphery of the department and the funding situation is very precarious, which scares the shit out of me because I am very against the other topics in the department. I thought i could just suck up the fact that the department is not exactly what I want for the sake of the research but that's definitely not the case. I'm not really sure what to do now, it's kind of hard to drop out and get a normal job bc like I said before my ugrad degree isnt worth much, but I'm very scared that by quitting the PhD I will become poison to other grad programs in my old field. I just do not know what to do, I feel insanely stupid for putting myself in this position.

1hnstzj,How bad would it be to quit phd after one semester,"Just finished my first semester and honestly despised it. I pivoted fields a bit to do a particular research topic but that was a huge mistake, and the program has made me extremely miserable. My field is also very depressing r.e. the future which has taken a heavy mental toll on me and makes me question whether it's even worth investing the time to do a phd. I kind of knew these things going in but i thought it (a) would not be this bad and (b) the research would balance it out, but the research has definitely failed on that front. It appears I will be working on extremely tight budgets for my experiments for the forseeable future which makes it very difficult because even from the first semester, it seems the onus is on me to come up with research ideas. My co-PIs also seem to have very different visions of what my PhD is supposed to be about which freaks me out because the things they want are very different and I didn't sign up to do some of those things. I think we also have some fundamental differences on how we want to go about research, i.e. i care more about the mechanisms of how things work vs they care about the engineering applications, those things arent mutually exclusive but it seems like I'll be limited on the mechanism front. 

Anyway tldr first semester sucked, and doesn't look like things are going to get better. I would grit my teeth for another semester, but I have a great job offer on the table. Its not really in my field, but it provides a lot of the flexibility and things that I miss (my field is very limiting geographically even after PhD, which is another thing I've struggled with about this path). I'm very tempted to take it, but I'm also very conflicted, because I don't think i hate doing a PhD, i just hate this one lol. I'm wondering what the potential drawbacks would be in the future of dropping out so early, if i were to take the job and then perhaps reapply elsewhere or do a masters in a year or two. I realise that it doesn't reflect well, but there is a relatively reasonable explanation for why (pivoted fields, didnt work out). Idk im just very scared at the moment, i  dont want to go back, but I really do enjoy doing research when there isnt so much shit being flung around, but perhaps that is just part of the deal of research and im not cut out for it",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hnstzj/how_bad_would_it_be_to_quit_phd_after_one_semester/

1jk6lef,Mentor requested surgery be moved up w/o mentee consent,"I am currently in the 3rd year of my PhD and have started having some difficulties managing my mentor/mentee relationship. Before all of this, our relationship was great! But started to go downhill when my experiments began not working before my first thesis committee meeting. 

In Fall of 2024, around October, I started to fall ill due to a chronic health condition which ultimately lead to needing surgery to address the issue. I was nauseous everyday, would have urgent (if you catch my drift) upper and lower GI symptoms, would be in constant pain that would worsen when I would eat, random chills, reoccurring fevers, and serious fatigue. Most days I would lay in bed sleeping or feeling so ill I would be unable to stand up. This affected my ability to do my laundry, wash my dishes, cook for myself, bathe etc.. Being in my early 20s, this was extremely difficult going from being able bodied and productive, to feeling constant guilt and anger towards myself for not being able to function. 

As you can imagine, this deeply impacted my productivity towards my PhD (I take full responsibility). Realistically, I was regularly missing 2 days a week from lab, and while I tried to pick up the slack from home, there is no replacement for physically being at the bench in a wet lab. It was about the same time my illness began to come through that my experiments began not working, compounding the issue. My mentor expressed they were not satisfied with my progress (neither was I) and I made the decision to have surgery. Fast forward to scheduling the surgery, the only availability they had was <2 months away, so I took it and tried my best to produce as much data as I could beforehand. Which again, my experiments were still not going smoothly, and I continued to get worse physically as I tried to push myself to appease my mentor. My mentor then took it upon themself to email my surgeon WITHOUT my consent, requesting my date be moved up, then texted me the new date, ”you see that and confirm?”(Someone say HIPAA!). While I would have wanted the surgery sooner, I had no one to drive and stay with me that day or after, nor could I get a pre-op appointment rescheduled to have the necessary bloods done (required week before surgery). When I notified the mentor I would be continuing with the current scheduled date, I was told I was making a mistake.

Since having returned from surgery, I have been threatened with academic probation repeatedly, have had remarks about my condition made to my lab mates by the mentor behind my back, was told I was prioritizing my personal life when I was sick, have been directly insulted to my face in response to sharing data that was normalized incorrectly,” do you have eyes? Can you see?”, have been told if im unwilling or unable to come in on the weekends that I am not fit for a PhD, among other things. The last banger, was when they told me they would be shocked if I hadn’t thought about mastering out. Then immediately after the conversation, went and told our Tech I was dropping out! I wish.

The anxiety I have developed from this relationship has sent me into panic attacks on numerous occasions, so much so I had to start taking anxiety medication. I feel confused, I feel crazy, I feel guilty, I feel bullied. Since coming back from surgery, I have been putting in the work, maybe I eased back in for a week or two, but I JUST had an organ removed! It feels like anything I do at this point will not change their attitude towards me and I feel as if I am being pushed out, conveniently right around the time the training grant I am being paid through is ending. From my perspective, it seems I fell ill and my productivity dropped, they became mad because I wasn’t producing data like I used to, and are now resentful and/or acting in retaliation because they do not think I am worth the upcoming cost. I do not feel seen as a person, only a means to an end. If anyone has any suggestions on what I should do or alternative perspectives, it would be much appreciated. I am to the point that I want to finish this PhD because I am almost 3 years deep, but if I continue to be treated like this, there feels like no other choice than to leave. I cannot put up with 2 more years of this.

***It is also important to point out, this has not been the first mentee under this mentor who has dealt with issues pertaining to illness. I have also tried to get them to see my perspective and understand the constraints I faced with chronic illness. They don’t seem receptive and instead rehash their discontent with my previous effort.

1mwx2uu,I feel like my master’s thesis is terrible - a few days before deadline,"My thesis is due in less than two weeks and I’m spiraling. While re-reading my literature review, I found a few mistakes and realized my research strategy was kind of weak because I missed a few papers. I even met with a librarian  but he probably didn’t throughly understand what I was looking for. At the time I wrote that section, I didn’t have the knowledge I do now. On top of that, I actually sent my first draft months ago and only got feedback in July, right before going on vacation, so I didn’t have time to fix anything anyway. I also wanted to wait for my PI’s feedback before changing anything, which left me stuck. Now I don’t have the time to add those papers, but I’m terrified of being called out. The thing is, these papers don’t really change anything since they are models that don’t apply to my population, but I still feel like I’m handing in something incomplete and mediocre.

My project was also way too heavy for a master’s. To the point where the postdoc in our team is furious because she feels like I got the most complex and publication worthy project. We didn’t have the time to run all the analyses that would have made the study rock solid, so we just settled for what we had. We still got a lot of results, but not enough to feel 100% complete.

A research assistant tried to reassure me by saying a master’s thesis is really just proof that you did research for two years and that you understand it, not a perfect study. She also told me my PI’s students have never gotten major corrections in her entire career (25 years+). Instead of calming me down, that actually made me feel worse, because now I feel like if I do get major corrections I’ll forever be remembered as the one student who ruined the streak.

I’m terrified to the point where I actually considered dropping out because I’m so ashamed of the thesis, especially the litterature review part.

I'm almost at the end of a corporate summer internship as a hardware intern at a big silicon company. If I get a return offer then I do plan to take it and work for 2-3 years before going to grad school.   
    
The thing is that I'm unsure between applying for an MS or a PhD. I haven't really had much research experience during UG till now but I do plan to take up some projects in my senior year to get a taste of it. If I like it then I'll consider applying for a PhD but what if I don't like it? 

A straightforward answer would be to then just go for a Masters but I'm worried about the financial aspect of it. I already took a loan for UG so it'll take me a good 2-3 years to repay it even with a high paying corporate job in my country (which is why I decided to work for a few years first). But I'm a bit hesitant to take another loan for PG as well (which I plan to do in the US).     
    
I've also heard about people dropping out from a PhD with just a masters. Is that something that many universities offer or is it rare? And would that 'dropping out' part have a negative impact on my career?

1kd0fq0,“Professionalism” irks me,"NOTE: pls remember that this is a vent so it may come off as I’m solely blaming others and not introspectively reflecting on what I could improve on. There’s a lot of things I could have done. The things that actually would have improved patient care, I’ve already incorporated in my future rotations. I could have done more social catering and laughed at stupid jokes and looked more engaged when hearing about attending’s personal life for the millionth time, but none of that is egregious enough to warrant the label of “unprofessional” ALL THIS TO SAY, anybody about to comment “suck it up it’s what you signed up for” or “yea you’re the med student you’re supposed to kiss ass” can just save their breath and please just don’t!!! 

As the kids are saying these days, I’m so so so so damn close to crashing out


——-

Professionalism in 3rd year of medical school is a joke. It is no longer just showing up on time and doing your work. Evaluators can just throw it in as a scathing blow just to mask that they’ve been offended in some way (no matter how minuscule). It has just become a term that truly means “how much is a med student willing to put up with and treat me like I am God’s greatest gift to mankind?” 

For example, on my 2nd ever inpatient rotation (mind you my 1st rotation was OBGYN and they wouldn’t let me do shit or even acknowledge my existence so I just stayed out of their way and didn’t learn anything), the resident, fellow, and attendings would have 1 on 1 casual check-ins with each med student. They’d ask generic questions like “how do you think this rotation is going so far” “what is it you’d like to work on” and “what feedback do you have for us so we can improve your rotation” and we were assured that all of this was just casual and they just genuinely wanted to know. Well, I listed off majority positives (loved pre-rounding and talking to the patients and family in the morning, loved seeing how they interacted with the patients, loved learning things when they would teach us, etc etc) BUT I was honest that rounding was not a component that I looked forward to daily. I made sure to say I understand that’s how inpatient medicine works and can appreciate how important rounding was to many specialities in medicine. For preface, I had already been set on a specialty since 1st year of medical school that doesn’t have rounding at all. coming into 3rd year, all was left was to truly confirm that specialty for me. I had shadowed a bunch within that specialty and made connections, but hadn’t had much exposure to the core clerkship specialties. So, being on this rotation, I had just further confirmed to myself that I’m still sold on the specialty that I originally desired. Didn’t go much into why I didn’t like rounding. Just stated that I tend to lean towards wanting to work with my hands like surgery or anesthesia and do procedures over rounding. Didn’t shit talk or say that I thought these specialties were superior or more important than this one, but just said it was simply a personal preference. That tiny comment that was dropped in a sea of positives and praises somehow became the only thing they remembered. On my eval, they said that I had expressed that I did not like rounding on many occasions and thus I was lacking effort and combative to learning. I mean, duh if multiple individuals are asking me the same questions then I’m gonna supply the same answers multiple times. I wasn’t the perfect student but damn did I try. I tried to do things preemptively to show initiative, asked questions to show I was interested, and wanted to be true to myself. I pushed myself to take on 2-3 patients in the mornings, pre-round, prepare to give a comprehensive SOAP presentation, and wrote med student notes in the afternoons just for the practice. I absolutely love learning and would argue to say that I perked up the most when they would start teaching on rounds or asking us questions. This was commensurated by my high shelf scores all throughout this year. I had patients and their family rave to my team about how wonderful I was and how attentive, caring, knowledgeable, and professional I was. Surprise surprise absolutely no mention of these things on my eval. Even within these individual feedback meetings, the resident/fellow/attending directly acknowledged how engaged I was during learning and just advised to keep it up since I was so early in the year that I have so much to learn. They didn’t offer much advice besides generic “youre at the level expected of a medical student at this point in the year so just keep learning/reading and putting in effort” which I expressed that I wholeheartedly agreed with. 

What I truly despised about rounding was not that it occurs or that it was stupid. I hated the way it dragged and dragged and not for productive or medically relevant reasons. It was because the attending would go on unrelated personal tangents or crack jokes and look at the team to see who laughs. I do think how hospitalists round just seemed inefficient. to have med students go pre-round and do everything, report to the resident in the morning who had to go do everything again, then to present to the attending/fellow on rounds just for them to zone out during presentations and then proceed to ask the patients the same questions and do the same physical exam and say the same findings and plan as the presentation stated. Like, why not just have us present at table rounds then the attending go round themselves and then tell us if they found something different in hx or physical exam or had a different plan then what the presentation stated. That way, we could just go back to the patient room on our own and try to find the murmur, breath sound, bruise, or other physical exam finding that we had missed earlier. That would save time for everybody involved and give us more time to be with the patient and be in a quiet room with our stethoscope and learn what we are supposed to look out for. It’s difficult when I don’t know what the fucking difference between rhonchi and crackle is but when I’m listening, like 2-3 other residents are having like separate loud ass conversations with the patient, family, and their nurses. And I know damn well when the other kiss ass med students are listening, they don’t hear a damn thing but they say they did just to get on the attending’s good side. But when I say truthfully that I don’t hear anything and even after adjustments still can’t, then the attending/fellow looks frustrated with me like I’m not trying. Like my bad bro, I’m actually trying to learn how to be a competent physician here. Oop Sorry I just went on another mini rant right there. 

Anyways, so I had to meet with the school admin for “professionalism” issues who just lectured me about how I need to put up with bs or else I’m unprofessional. when I brought up how my comment about rounding was just stating my thoughts out loud for if I can see myself doing this specialty for a career and I really couldn’t understand why it just drastically tainted their impression of me, they just defended the evaluators and said that I should have known not to say that because of course it would be offensive to knock such an integral component to a specialty that they had set out a lifetime pursuing. But……. It wasn’t. It was just how they took it. Again, I did not say one was inferior to the other. Nothing was directed at their specialty. And in trying to get a different perspective, I was reflecting on if would I get offended if I was a lawyer or teacher and somebody in the healthcare field came up and told me they appreciated and respected what I do but just found the subject matter boring or wouldn’t enjoy it as a career? And the answer is being offended wouldn’t have even crossed my mind. It’s just a simple preference based on what different people’s interests and skill sets are. So yea, I was being lectured by so called professionals defending other professionals who took offense to a premise that they fabricated in their own minds. Yet I’m the unprofessional one. The difference is them saying I’m unprofessional can ruin my whole future matching whereas what I said wasn’t even offensive and they are just emotionally immature to not take it personally. And, any effort in clarifying that is taken as being combative or unwilling to take feedback. I understand med students are the dog shit of the earth, but I’m not going to just accept something that is damning of me when I don’t at all believe that’s true. And I’m not going to simply agree with you because you have an MD behind your name. I’m just so fucking fed up with 3rd year. I feel like I have to compromise my integrity and morals just to suffice their ego when they are failing to set good examples of professionalism, humility, compassion, and everything they are spewing about being a good doctor. If they’re the examples of what a good doctor should be then I had more than a rude awakening. A good doctor that treats people under them like shit shouldn’t be within a 10 foot radius of being an evaluator, mentor, or preceptor. 

If you call every resident unprofessional for complaining about how they hate their lives one singular time, then you’re not going to have any residents left. Of course there are things that are good and that suck. Studying for hours suck. Being paged for stupid stuff sucks. Working long hours suck. Going into debt to pretty much be indentured servants sucks. Doctors beam with pride when talking about how rigorous the shit they had to endure, yet act offended when you say the same thing hoping we can just have a laugh about it and admit the process genuinely sucks but the end goal will be worth it. It’s just the necessary evil to get to being able to be a doctor. If given the preference, I don’t think any attending would be eager to do medical school or residency again. So Why sugarcoat it? I even told them that all of us as a cohort feel the same way, they’re just not willing to admit it to the people that they know will evaluate them. Point blank, that’s just punishing my honesty and encouraging other people’s dishonesty. 

It just fucking sucks because residencies don’t get the context. They just see “unprofessional” “unable to take feedback” etc and assume I was this brooding emo kid who just hated everything and just refused to do everything. I hate how subjective “professionalism” as a measure is. And I hate that evaluations are so subjective yet are treated as an objective metric. It’s luck of the draw if you get a super nice and realistic evaluator or you’re stuck with egotistically fragile and emotionally stunted individuals. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE! And, any advice on how I can address this in my ERAS application if the comments show up on the MSPE? I’m determined to be a good physician and I know I’ll become one. I just feel drained and so lost on how I can convince residencies of that or how I can phrase it to not come off like a bratty teenager who thinks the world is against them. I don’t. I’ve had glowing evals from other evaluators including the outpatient evals of the same rotation. Patients have expressed positive things to me. The nurses, janitors, staff who all don’t get to evaluate me continually express their surprise at how kind and polite and grateful I am to them and how that’s so far from how the residents and attendings treat them. I’ve cried, screamed, pulled out hair, doubled my dose of antidepressants, contemplated dropping out of medical school just because of how much I abhorred being associated with this group of “professionals”. I knew it was bad, but I thought I could just stay true to myself and focus on the important things and the rest will fall in place. I just need to graduate and get out of this malignant program. But how tf do I bounce back from this eval? ",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1kd0fq0/professionalism_irks_me/

I know I tend to be impatient and jump to conclusions, but I really need to take a step back and hear from people who’ve been through the same. Seeing my grades just made this feeling of frustration and hate grow even stronger. Compared to the rest of the class, I probably can still pass the year. I've seen people with better grades than mine still fail, but I don’t want to assume that’s the rule or something that’s bound to happen to me.

ijd05e,"Considering dropping out of college, want to hear from others","As the title says, I’m considering dropping out of college. I truthfully don’t even know why I’m here anymore. I started college way back in 2014, and it has been nothing but a battle since. Through the last 6 years, it has been a constant struggle financially and family problems have been abundant. I have had constant swings of anxiety and depression, and I’ve neared a full mental breakdown on several occasions at this point. Withdrawals, failures, and college major changes have happened in near cycles at this point, and I don’t have any motivation left in me to even open up a textbook at all anymore. I feel I can barely even look at a course syllabus anymore. I am presently a dual statistics and economics major, and even through all this time, I still have 2 years left just to finish undergrad. That’s with attending full time. 

Last winter, I partnered with a good friend of mine who went on to do his own thing in life and became a developer with IBM. We are now developing 4 different platforms, and we are less than 5 months away from a marketable MVP on our primary platform. In January, I plan to begin traveling all over to take our mission to stage 2. 

At this point, I don’t even know why I’m in college anymore. I believe I’ve found what I want to do after all of this struggle, and I don’t know anymore if my desire to finish college is just because I was told I needed it all my life or if I truly want that piece of paper. I’m 30k in debt with nothing to show for it, and I’ve reached the point where I believe I want to just say f*** it and go all in on my business endeavors.

1j2wddb,Debating if I should drop out of my PhD,"I know this is probably a very common type of post, and this is something that PhD students usually get told that it gets better. But does it really? I’m close to an all time low in mental health right now and am really struggling with the motivation to keep going.
I am a first year PhD in the behavioural sciences, and although I do like the topic of behaviour in general and reading some of the papers, I really dislike the tediousness of the day to day life. To give some background I have been diagnosed with ADHD and it it’s extremely difficult for me to always sit by a computer, continuously read and have to do tedious tasks. I like coming up with ideas but feel like I give up too quickly when things gets hard. I feel so empty doing this and although it’s “only” 5 years im really struggling to even get by the first year. 
It’s not that easy to drop out as I am independent so would need another source of income, so would probably need to secure a job before doing anything drastic. But, I don’t know what else I would do for work that might also not make hate it eventually. I guess I am struggling with determining if I truly don’t like this topic/lifestyle enough to do a PhD or if I am just lazy and giving up because it’s hard. 
I am very lost and need some advice! Is this normal?? What should I do?

1lgy5e9,Need advice to rebuild my life,"I had to drop out of a PhD program at a prestigious university that was extremely difficult to get into. The main reason was a severe illness, which led to multiple hospitalizations. Since then, I’ve been trying to apply to PhD programs at decent universities, but my applications have mostly been rejected. My Master’s degree is now considered outdated, and the gap in my academic record caused by dropping out has raised concerns.

During one interview, I was told that while my mathematical skills are clearly strong, the committee had no proof I could handle the pressure of a PhD due to my past health issues. I was so shocked and devastated by that conversation that I suffered an epileptic seizure—I have genetic epilepsy.

Right now, I'm considering doing a PhD at a lower-ranked university, possibly abroad and without funding, in the hope of producing strong enough research results to eventually apply for a postdoc. The whole situation is incredibly discouraging. It likely means I’ll spend most of my 20s chasing research under difficult conditions, but at this point, I feel like I have no other choice.

At the start of my college journey I made some pretty bad decisions which led me to leave my university and join a community college. At this community college I ended up skipping a lot of my classes due to being unmotivated and kind of depressed. This led me to dropping out of it with a 1.7 GPA. I chose to go back to a different school to give myself one last chance to see what I could accomplish if I actually tried focusing on school. Fast forward a year later and I have a 4.0 with 37 credits taken and I’m hoping to transfer to my dream school of UT Austin.

Currently in my fourth year and studying in one of the best engineering colleges in the country. But I really don't want to return to the campus. I came home for the Diwali festival, but am currently dreading the idea of going back to my hostel room and dealing with the stress again. The coursework is insanely tough and I hate how competitive everyone is out there. Not to mention the god-awful inconsiderate professors out there who keep insanely hard quizzes, tests, lab evals, assignments, vivas every fucking week. They teach jack-shit and expect everyone to ace ridiculously tough evals. Everywhere I go I get involved in conversations about GPAs, grades and facing the cutthroat competition of securing a job in a company. It's like everyone's forgotten that there's more to life than that. It's not that I don't have friends; i have a good number of dudes I hang out with often. But the discussions and gossip with them is not something I really look forward to. They give me anxiety and panic attacks. Not to mention the awful food in the mess and the number of times I fall sick during the semester. I haven't had a single night of peaceful sleep in my entire college life. My eyes don't close till 4 or 5 in the morning, and I wake up in the afternoon having missed most of the classes. My body doesn't feel good for the entire day after that.

I really miss this peace and tranquility I find at home. I have a loving family who cares about me. I forget everything about college and it really calms me down. My health improves and I can focus more. I get to talk to people, meet my old school friends and have conversations about life which I truly value.

16bnpz2,Residency - my thoughts on evaluating programs,"There are some factors that are crucial to understand when choosing a residency program. Much of it we have to get through the grapevine since asking it outright may not be proper interview etiquette but it is nonetheless very important to understand.

# Working Conditions

'**80 hr work week**'  
Really depends on the specialty and the program. In general, I believe it is mostly honored, however, that is not true among some programs, particularly in the surgeries. Try to figure out either through a sub-I or through the grapevine if that is true. Also, if 24-hour call, **figure out if the post-call day is honored** or if you are expected to stay for morning cases.

There has been talk of the **ACGME potentially moving to a 60-hour cap** but I doubt that will come anytime soon.

**Scutwork/Midlevel support**  
*What* you do is as important as *how much* you do it. For a surgical resident, 60 hours covering the floor and writing notes is probably *worse* than 100 hours being involved in the OR. Everyone will say they get good clinical training/autonomy but you have to look between the lines to actually see if that is true.

When you're working crazy hours, **there are simply tasks that don't need clinical skill and can be better handled by a midlevel**. For example, writing notes, repleting lytes, taking primary call, getting mawmaw out to the SNF. Some programs are better than others in how they use midlevels to make their resident's life easier. Ask about this -- **if/how many midlevels are on staff, how their role compares with the residents, specifically** ***when*** **midlevels are around** (only daytime M-F is much different than 24/7), and **if the residents think they need more support**. Added bonus if the program had an established midlevel support system before the residency was begun, as it typically means residents aren't used for some of these bullshit admin tasks.

**Look at the role of the intern** and that will tell you the attitude the program has toward its residents. How much of their time is spent covering the floor/giving call coverage? How much effort is put into intern education? For surgical residencies, do the interns get any OR time?

**Resident cohort**  
The number of residents you have will dramatically impact your experience. As someone going into a small surgical subspecialty, **fewer co-residents = less chance for night float, increased call burden, less buffer for a coresident changing programs/dropping out, child leave, etc.** Also, if you notice that one year has one less resident, you need to dig in and figure out why. There is always a chance that it was a one-off but **multiple years with missing residents should raise some red flags**. 

**The Hospital/Institution**  
Frankly, there is are differences in hospital funding and how admin chooses to care for the facilities. I have seen in both ways -- newer facilities regularly cleaned vs. outdated ones with restrooms that haven't seen a mop in 3 months. This kind of stuff will eat at you over the years and is certainly something to consider.

**Resident Attitude Toward 'Life Outside the Hospital'**  
This one is hard to get an idea of unless you rotate there but look at the resident's urgency to get out the door. I’ve noticed that at some programs residents will literally just meander around without any aim, talking to people. Others have a sense of urgency to get people home and people will work together to get patients 'tucked in' for the night. This one is personal -- I have a family, I am not going to be sitting around shooting the shit at the end of the day. I want to be somewhere where that is valued and prioritized. If the residents mention having significant hobbies, this is a great indication life outside the hospital is valued.

# Salary, Benefits, and Perks

PGY1 salary generally ranges from \~55-75k (VHCOL areas up to 90k). **Salary is NOT the only number to look at**. The amount of health insurance provided and retirement match offered (or not) can be the difference of $10k.

Also, **do they pay for Step 3 and licensing exams**? If they don't, that's $$$ left on the table.

**Paid travel for conferences** is another indication they value resident education and want you to reach your career goals.

**Undervalued Perks**

A great way to see how much an institution cares about its residents is to look at non-traditional benefits offered. 

Are you offered discounted/free recreational passes, discounts to local events (eg, sports), public transportation? It's out there and many programs offer this stuff.

The **quality of food available at the hospital is dramatically overlooked** when evaluating a program. Also, the cost of food/size of the stipend. Are you able to get a good breakfast with a True nutrition 50g protein shake without worrying about it? Or are you rationing to get through the month? Also, **when are the cafeterias open**? Being on night float is going to suck when the cafeteria is only open 6am-6pm.

**Do residents get access to the physicians lounge**? Look, if the midlevels are getting access but residents aren't, that's a big 'fuck you' from admin. *Fuck these people if you're working 100 hours a week and they aren't going to take care of you*.

# Unionizing

This post is already long so I'll be succinct. Regardless of how you feel about unions, **resident unions have proven to be exceptionally effective**. I am not aware of a single program where this hasn't gone well for the residents. You are about to join a working class that hasn't had any bargaining power -- ever. Be wise and consider this as a potential factor. 

**Is a union present? If not, have residents been considering unionizing?** I would consider it a red flag if nothing has been considered -- either the residents are too overworked to try something or the institution has sufficiently busted anything up before it's gotten going.

Residents at my home institution got a **$10k raise last year** from *just threatening* to unionize. I would guess they probably left money on the table by deciding not to but I'm sure the 10k was worth the effort.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/16bnpz2/residency_my_thoughts_on_evaluating_programs/
1lwgezl,Should I email my professor about a late assignment!??,"According to my professor’s syllabus, all assignments and discussion boards are due at 12:00 p.m. However, today’s discussion board was locked at 10:00 a.m. I had planned to work on it this morning since I worked late last night, but I didn’t realize the deadline had been moved up.

I’m currently taking five summer classes while working 40–45 hours, and mentally, I feel completely drained. I’ve been trying so hard to stay on top of both school and work. I’m doing well in all my other classes—just not this one.

We did have seven days to complete the assignment, but to be honest, it got away from me. And I will admit that. I’m supposed to graduate in December, but I’m so stressed that I’ve seriously considered dropping out. At the beginning of the semester, I spoke with the program director, and she told me that if I ever found myself struggling, I should reach out to her.

1mwzv6b,Changing fields: Better to drop current PhD or do a second PhD,"I'm in the second year of a PhD in subject A and I wish to build a career in subject B instead. I only chose to go into subject A because I was having a mental health crisis and not thinking clearly (I became convinced that I could effortlessly succeed in subject A but that subject B was beyond my capabilities intellectually). When I managed to heal from that, I realised that I sacrificed my decade long dream of pursuing subject B for no real reason, and instead am stuck pursuing subject A which I have no real interest in. My plan all along was to ""quickly and easily"" get tenure in A and immediately switch to B, there was never a moment of actually genuinely wanting to study subject A for the long haul. In contrast, if you told me 100% that I would never get a professorship in subject B, I would still want to do a PhD in B just to have that experience in my life of being able to engage with research in it and to experience being surrounded by other people who love the thing I love most in my life.

In similar situations people often suggest trying to publish research in A and incrementally move towards doing research in B. When these subjects are closely related, I think that is feasible. However, in my case subject B is a very abstract area of pure mathematics, and subject A is a very applied non-mathematical subject, so I don't think this is feasible. I don't know that there is an audience to even publish such papers for were I able to think them up.

Hence, it appears to me that there are only two courses of action to choose between:

1. Drop out of this PhD program and try to apply to program in B.

2. Complete this PhD and then try to apply to do a second PhD in B.

My concern with (1) is that it feels very risky to throw away a stable income source and to have the red flag of dropping out of a PhD on my next application. My concern with (2) is that the sentiment against doing a second PhD seems strong online, and I worry whether funding agencies would even approve me getting a scholarship to do a second PhD (my family is not rich).

I would love to hear advice on how to best manage this move back to aligning my career with my actual research passion, and I would really love to hear advice from someone who started a PhD in the wrong field and then successfully moved into a different field.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mwzv6b/changing_fields_better_to_drop_current_phd_or_do/
rw51v0,I'm starting to have moral doubts about working in higher education,"Hi all, I was hoping to vent a little and gets some thoughts on some concerns I've been having.  I'm not a professor, I work in a support role in the engineering department of a mid-ranked state school.  I do work closely with students and TAs with their labs and build projects, so I would hope my post is allowed here.

I left a previous career in industry because I very specifically wanted to do work where I was making a positive contribution to society.  That's why I leaped into a role in academia, somewhat naïve as to how things ran.  The pandemic has really opened my eyes as to how much college is still a business, and we are routinely told ""enrollment equals salary"" as we push for new record high numbers of admits. Lately I can't help but feel that a large portion of our students have no business being here, and **we actively make their lives worse by encouraging them.**  They come in unprepared, have misconceptions about the field, skate by, and have a hard time finding work. Now I'd be fine with saying ""Well they're adults responsible for their own decisions"" if it not for the fact that we either ignore their issues or go out of our way to make them worse.

\- We do no real debt counseling.  I have students who I can tell will struggle to find well paying jobs taking on $100k+ in debt with no concept as to how much that really is.  They just know ""engineers make a lot of money"" and no one bats an eye.

\- We misguide students on what they'll be making.  Our marketing material advertises high median salaries, not mentioning they are skewed by jobs in high cost of living areas, or that starting salaries are significantly lower.  The average starting salary in our region is nearly half the number we tell students they can expect to make.

\- We misguide students about the job market.  Experienced engineers are in demand, but entry level jobs are incredibly competitive.  Yet ask incoming students where they expect to work and the majority will tell you Tesla, Google, SpaceX, etc.  We profile grads who make it to these companies or do exciting work while ignoring that the vast majority have no shot at these jobs.  Our career center does little more than review resumes.

\- We misguide students on the curriculum.  We advertise working with state of the art equipment and building high tech devices like robots.  In reality only a small percentage of students will have access to the high end stuff, most will be doing 30 year old experiments on outdated equipment.  I've had recruiters dumbfounded that our students aren't taught industry standard tools and software.

\- We are soft on cheating, if we do anything about it at all.  Talking to students tells me cheating and drug use for studying is rampant in almost every class, but they feel faculty either don't know or don't care enough to do anything about it.  The issue is never brought up at higher levels, and admin will straight up tell you we don't have a cheating problem.  The result is a lot of grads who can't make it through a technical interview.

\- When students have trouble finding a job or feel lost and unsure what to do we usually just steer them toward grad school.  More debt and delaying the inevitable.  I've never heard of a student being told they should consider switching departments or dropping out, the focus is always on keeping them in house.

I can't tell if I'm being overly negative, but I'm really struggling these days with being part of a system that I feel is taking advantage of a lot of young people.  We continue to push for higher enrollment using the lure of well paying jobs, which makes me feel that things are just going to get worse.  Are we really just offering a learning opportunity  to students?  Or do we have a responsibility to help lead our student down a path that's best for them instead of what's best for us?

**Tl;dr - I feel our school purposely takes on students with little chance of succeeding in our field and ignores their issues for the sake of revenue.  Is this a reality I have to face working in academia?**

1ck6nzj,"After 3 years, I'm Dropping Out; Advice Needed","I'll try to keep this short! Essentially I've always been into art and drawing, so naturally out of high school, I went to college for a studio arts degree. But after two semesters I realized I would absolutely \*hate\* working in that industry, so all of a sudden I had no idea what I wanted to do, as I had no real career motives aside from that.

Flash forward a year, I finish up my AA, but I still have no idea what I want to do. I'm basically squandering away my time taking random classes to see if anything seems interesting, but it's all more so for an easy grade. I like what I'm learning, but I just can't seem to find anything that makes me say ""this is what I want to do.""

Flash froward one more year, basically all I've done is get my AA and made no progress on any sort of 4-year degree due to taking random classes the entire time. So I consider just dropping out. I'm wasting my time, and I already have a decent job I'm making an okay living at for now.

I'm just really terrified of the prospect of regretting it heavily. I know I'll likely want to come back to school in a couple of years, maybe after I discover a career I'm passionate about. I know it's easier to get better paying jobs with a full 4-year degree. And at the moment, I have a full ride to college, so of course I feel like I failed and just waisted this absolutely incredibly lucky opportunity just because my original plan fell through.

So I'm hoping someone can give me some perspective. Did anyone else here drop out and come back later on? Did it end up working out? Was it difficult? Or just kinda part of the journey? I'm just curious to here as I have no idea where my life might be going or what I might want to do lol

  
Edit: Thank you guys for all your input and advice! I seriously can't thank you guys enough! While I felt sort of decided before, I was definitely stressed and not at all satisfied with dropping out entirely. I just felt as though I truly messed up my chance at a degree, but reading all your advice helped a ton! I decided to change course and jump right back into my old art degree (I realized starting over with an entirely new degree might be a bit too difficult / take too long, as my ""full ride"" is set to end in two years). Even if it's not the degree I want, I can still use it in a lot of ways in the future! Plus, I'd have a ton of peace of mind just having any degree, and I wouldn't have to completely start all over. I'll be difficult to catch up, but I'm willing to do it. Thank you guys! ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ck6nzj/after_3_years_im_dropping_out_advice_needed/

1mb06oy,Terrified for college classes,"My high school experience was a weird one. I switched high schools 3 times, the last time to switch to an online school. 

At the beginning of high school, I had my plan laid out that I would take APs, dual credit, etc, which never ended up happening due to being in medical treatment programs and having brain surgery. It truly lowered my self worth to simply not have the ability to do these classes - being in school 40 hours a week and in treatment for 15-30 (while having a job and in extracurriculars) was super difficult, and there was no way I would have the time or energy. 

I graduated high school with a 4.0, one of the top of my class at a small school. Now I’ll be a freshman at a tech school, taking my gen ed classes there before transferring for my degree. I am beyond terrified that I am behind, and that not taking these upper level classes makes me unprepared for college. I’m worried that I will fail, and that I will end up dropping out. I have an executive functioning disorder that impacts my learning, so this is an additional worry for me. 

I guess I would like to know what others think, and I’m open to any advice as well. What are your tips to not fall behind? Am I truly behind because I didn’t take these classes?

1luelch,Considering taking a break from college,"I’m a 20M who just started his second year at a private liberal arts university/ I already took a gap year after school, so I’m a year older than most of my batch. I’ve completed the first year, but honestly only got through the last trimester because I finally found some people I clicked with (most of them being seniors in their final years). Most of them have now graduated, and I’m back to square one, feeling like I don’t belong, and barely motivated to stay.

I’m not failing academically and actually have a quite high gpa, not dealing with addiction or external crises so it’s more internal. Constantly second-guessing myself, socially isolated, no strong support system left here, and not really seeing long-term value in pushing through just for a piece of paper two years from now. There are a few people I like talking to, but mostly I feel awkward walking around campus, half the people I know avoid me, the rest I avoid. Some of that is on me, I’ve made mistakes, lost connections, and I own that. But now I’m just… tired.

I’ve been considering taking a **trimester break** (our uni is trimester-based), going home, working with my dad for a while, and using that time to figure out what next — whether it’s transferring to a different uni closer to home, exploring uni or work programs abroad, or even something entirely different. But I’m worried:

* Will I spiral worse at home with no structure?
* Will the break actually help or just delay the inevitable?
* Is staying better even if I’m miserable since at least I’d be “progressing”?
* How do I convince my parents that I’m not dropping out entirely, just trying to realign?

I’ve already spent way too much time clinging to a version of this college life that doesn’t exist for me anymore. But I don’t want to make a move out of impulse either.

Also, I’m not looking for emotional support, just practical advice from people who’ve been in similar situations. Anyone taken a break mid-degree? Or stayed and wished they hadn’t?",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1luelch/considering_taking_a_break_from_college/

1ce5059,Why is the amount of time you get a degree shamed if it’s not within the standard 2-4 years that it usually takes to acquire one?,"Just to clarify this: I mean two years in the case of an Associates and four years in the case of a Bachelors degree. Anyway, I had posted under someone else’s comment in a different subreddit the other day that it had taken me six years (no, your eyes aren’t deceiving you, six years) just to get my Associates degree. Shortly after I was met with comments like “Oh, six years is such a long time.” I mean… obviously I’m aware? Lmaoo. I had my own personal reasons as to why it took that long in the first place (and no, I don’t condone staying in college that long if you can actually help it). However, everyone is different and we all have our own journeys. I still got my Associates degree and I’m 59% done with my Bachelors. Despite even dropping out at one point during my path to an Associates degree I made it through and I graduated back in May of 2021, during a whole global pandemic at 25. My determination pushed me to continue on despite everything I was going through and I made it happen anyway. I will again when it comes to my Bachelors degree too.

The point behind me saying this is that there’s usually context when it comes to people not progressing as fast in their degrees, whether it comes down to them just not being able to complete their work, depression, issues with mental health, family obligations etc. I just think it’s a little odd to try to downplay others achievements when it comes to getting a degree. At the end of the day getting it is the most important part. Whether someone completes a degree in a few months or ten years it deserves to be applauded . College isn’t necessarily an easy road and I think more compassion needs to be given in general when it comes to things like that instead of just going by societies standards of what’s deemed as an “acceptable” time frame to get a degree or not. Whether it’s fast or slow. 

You don’t really know anyone else’s story fully unless you’re walking in their shoes and actually living through them (which can’t happen), so I wish people would be a bit more mindful of that before passing judgement on degree time frames. 

That saying “if getting a degree was easy everybody would have one” applies, just saying.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ce5059/why_is_the_amount_of_time_you_get_a_degree_shamed/

I'll give a (somewhat) brief story of my journey into university. I went straight to university right after high school as an engineering student, however, I quickly realised that engineering was not for me. So I told my parents and they supported my decision to drop out and start again next semester. I had about a 4 month break of me just doing nothing, and I regret not getting a part-time job which was very silly of me not to. During that break though, I suddenly decided that I wanted to pursue medicine, not because I was passionate for it, but because I thought that it would please my parents, since I already disappointed them with dropping out of engineering. I decided to pursue a science degree this semester in order to get into med school after I graduate but obviously, due to my lack of interest, I gave up. I was not interested in having to go to school for too long, especially for something as intense and competitive as medicine. Hell, I wasn't even that passionate about becoming a doctor anyways, so why would I punish myself by undertaking school for it for the next 10 years? So now, I'm here, unenrolled in all of my classes and been going to university for the past few days pretending that I attended classes but in reality I'm just there to eat and talk to my friends in other degrees.

You can call me extremely immature, which is valid, because I feel like I'm way too spontaneous when making big decisions like this. Now I'm \~$2k in debt for nothing. I am mad at myself for not trying to work on myself and figure out what I want to do with my life, because now I'm an unemployed liar pretending to go to college. I'm in the process of making a resume and applying to McDonald's or literally anywhere who'll take me. Do y'all have any advice on whether or not I should tell my parents? Or any advice on what I should do with my life? All I know is that I want to go to university, I just have no idea what I want to do. I'm in Australia by the way.

Also, in Australia, there's this thing called a HECS-loan, which is a loan from the government that allows you to study tertiary education without having to pay anything, then once you start earning a certain amount, you pay it back.

1lzdvlo,Will one bad semester in undergrad affect my chances at getting into a decent masters program?,"So I finished undergrad with a 3.447 cumulative gpa. My gpa would be a lot higher if it wasn’t for one bad semester where I finished with a 1.7 gpa. Let me explain.

I started college in fall 2020 at one university. I was at this university for my whole freshman year and half of my sophomore year. During this time I always had a gpa of 3.5 or better. However , I ended up transferring to a better university in my state that was close to my home which would allow me to commute to school (I was living on campus at my first university). During the time I transferred I also planned on switching my major when I enrolled in my new university. Long story short, that first semester at my new university was extremely tough on me. I was extremely lost and was caught up between majors and was also adjusting to the commuting lifestyle. I finished my first semester at my new university (Spring 2022) with a 1.7 gpa and was placed on academic probation for the next semester. During the semester I was not only extremely depressed but genuinely contemplated dropping out of college. I ended up pushing myself to attend the next semester (Fall 2022) where I ended up getting a 4.0 that semester and was taken off academic probation.  Every semester until I graduated (Spring 2025) I maintained a 3.5 gpa or better every semester since then and even finished with a 3.8 gpa in my major. 

So basically is this something that admissions would be understanding of? Should I explain it in my application process? 

For the record, I am not applying to any schools that require GRE and some of the schools I’m looking to applying to I qualify for GRE waivers. I am also only applying to masters programs not PhDs.

Basically any and all help, comments, advice would be greatly appreciated. And please ask any questions if you need some clarification on certain things.

1mp9inw,Is a PhD worth it or should I dedicate to full time applications?,"
Hi y’all, I’m writing this to get some extra perspectives on what to do and would really appreciate y’all’s comments.

I’m about to enter my second year as a PhD student (no topic and no advisor). Admittedly the only reason I’m this far in is purely because I wasn’t able to find a full time job after I graduated with my masters (my fault as I started looking too late). My issue right now is that I’m miserable in my PhD. I can’t tell if it’s because I’m burnt out or anything else but I just have no motivation other than the bare minimum. And thus I’ve been seeing a PhD as a way to keep myself financially afloat (I work as a TA which fully covers tuition and a stipend that covers for the rest).

I’ve been trying to apply to full time positions while but I haven’t had any luck. This last summer I was able to get an internship and tried negotiating with the company to hire me full on, but they responded by saying their expectation is to be with me until I graduate. After talking with some friends, they recommended to me that I should just ditch the PhD and dedicate myself full time to leetcode and applications. I just don’t know if that is the right choice as with one I may be miserable but at least I have a job and can apply to a decent amount of jobs or have no income, coast on my savings for who knows how long, and apply to more jobs.

I’ve tried coming with lists of pros and cons for both ideas and to summarize the big points I have this:

PhD pro:
* Have income
* Open opportunities for internships to then spin into full time 
* Am still learning in the career I love
Cons:
* I would hate my life
* Wouldn’t be putting 100% into it
* Could potentially limit my options as a PhD is incredibly specialized

Dropping out pros:
* mental health
* Able to dedicate more time for DSA prep and applications
Cons:
* will have to explain a 1 year gap (graduated masters in 2024)
* No income
* At the whim of the cs market

I know having no income can be negated by taking up some non-cs job but how would that make me look on my resume?

What do yall think about my situation?

TLDR; PhD student that is severely burnt out who doesn’t know if continuing or dropping out to pursue full time applications is worth it.

1lxin7n,I cannot gauge at whether staying in my PhD program is the right decision for me,"I can’t tell if I made a mistake or not by agreeing to stay in my program. 


TLDR of my life over the last year and a half:
I start my PhD program. I find myself very unhappy in it but I push through. Things kinda get better for me. I learn I have a rare disease and start going to doctor’s appointments at least once a week. It becomes too much for me to emotionally balance with schoolwork. My advisor understands and supports me. Trump gets inaugurated (I work in an environmental/public health field) and am fearful I will not have a future or career post-graduation. With encouragement from my therapist and psychiatrist, I tell my advisor I’m dropping out. I can’t take the risk of being 30 years old by the time I graduate with no work experience. I apply to 100+ jobs within the last 4 months and get interviews, but never an offer. I am currently still a “student” to keep my health insurance until August.


Where I am now:
I want to have a job. I truly do. I dream about moving across the country and leaving my program. I want work experience and new challenges and being independent. However, I love my research and parts of staying home (i.e., proximity to doctors, hobbies). The last few months have been constant job rejections. It’s been hopeless. I told my advisor I would change my mind and stay in my program if I couldn’t find a job. He seemed happy at the thought of keeping me. He said he just needs an answer by mid-July (AKA now). I have two prospective jobs I’m waiting to hear from. 

Two days ago I see my one doctor and learn that I am getting surgery mid-August. I told my advisor that although I’m scared I’ll be depressed in this program, it’s so important for me to keep my health insurance and see my doctors. This would be worth everything to me. My advisor noted I’m close to finishing my degree anyway and that I should just finish it. So I decide to join the program again. 

I notice my advisor has two new students and is looking for a post-doc, so I asked if he still had room for me. Then he told me he would only have funding for me for one semester, and nothing more. He said funding will be difficult to get with the presidential admin. He *may* find funding for the Spring but there’s no guarantee. If I want to keep my insurance, I’ll have to ask other departments if they need a TA.

Now I’m like… do I even go back to school if funding will be a reoccurring issue? Or do I just keep applying to jobs and hope something comes my way? I know the job market is brutal right now. My thoughts were to enroll for that semester to keep my health insurance/get some answers from doctors, and still apply to jobs but I truly don’t know what I want in my life anymore! What would you guys do in my shoes? :(

TW:bereavement, vague mentions of injury.

TL;DR: I dropped out due to stress and physical health complications amidst some seriously poor working conditions. In my case, life looks better, and I'm more hopeful than I have been for a long time

So yesterday, I officially withdrew from my PhD programme. After 2.5 years of constant stress and what I now clearly see was straight up neglect from academics and other relevant staff in the face of raising continuous maintenance and safety issues, my mental health had seriously debilitated. This also exacerbated my chronic migraines so I was in physical pain half the time too. When I say safety issues, I'm talking serious improper storage of hazardous chemicals. My labmate and I started complaining after 4 people got hospitalised when we tried to rectify it and had a serious chemical spill. (we were told to, we didn't just start it). My labmate has literally been diagnosed with PTSD as a result of this event and the working conditions.

After finally breaking down crying in my supervisors office, he suggested I take an interruption of study. I replied that I think should I ever stop I didn't think I'd have the momentum to start again. We settled on me taking six weeks leave. That was 4 months ago. At this point I was having depressive episodes and anxiety attacks.

2 weeks into my leave, two close family members passed away. I was heavily involved in funeral arrangements, so I wasn't even thinking about the university when six weeks ended. The post grad research rep was so understanding, and filed to extend it another six weeks.

Over that time, I stayed in contact with my labmate and some other friends/colleagues, and basically nothing had changed. My labmate had managed to relocate to a different groups lab to finish her work and has said she has headaches less frequently - we hope this is due to less stress and not exposure to god knows what.

At some point, I started looking at some jobs. Then started applying to them and now have a confirmed, contract signed job as a local high school teacher. I feel like such a weight, such a burden is off my shoulders.

I think I could have rode out PhD stress from one largely absent supervisor and another who was present but not the most understanding (though to his credit, did send quite a sweet email to check in with me, but 3 months late imo). The work conditions and neglect broke me. I had a year and a half left of my funding and think that would have killed me.

I'm disappointed I will not be Dr. Arlexus. I feel no shame or remorse quitting, and I'm happy to be optimistic about the future again. I don't really know why I'm posting this - I guess it's a vent, but if someone reads this and feels comforted but the idea of life still being hopeful after dropping out, or just the idea that it can get better whether finishing or not, then I'm happy to have posted it.

1mcjmpc,Time to quit?,"After graduating in Bsc Mathematics last year, I gained a place on a CDT programme for an integrated PhD based in Computer Science. After the first year of taught courses in comp sci I found out how much I actually disliked programming, I don't get the same sense of creativity or satisfaction that I do with solving a Maths problem and I can't get my head round it. Now that the work I'm doing no longer stimulates me, I hate being sat down indoors all day at a desk. Moreover, I am not really that interested in the topic I've chosen (since CDT programmes are more restricted and topics are often given), I only chose it to work with a particular supervisor (who is wonderful). 

I suppose I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone through this, I don't want to suffer for 3 years crunching data on something I'm not even interested in for poor pay, when I could be finding something better to do with my time next. I know my parents will be disappointed since it was a great achievement to get my degree in the first place (1st generation degree holder), and they probably think I am dropping out because of my boyfriend (who yes I spent a lot of time with this year and my work suffered because of it).

So I graduated with a degree in international relations which I’ve later come to regret because after graduating in 2019 with my bachelor’s I’ve found no career path with that degree where I live and the competition to even get a good government job with it is next impossible. I am friends with a professor I enjoyed taking classes with at my university and he’s a professor emeritus and cool guy. 
Unfortunately, I failed a major course that was crucial to me graduating and I had to get mental health counseling because I was on the verge of dropping out and the councilor helped me. Yet I went from a 3.0 something to 2.73 when I graduated and so I felt like there’s no chance I will ever be accepted into grad school if I plan on. My university I went to was not a state university like say LSU, University of Georgia; more of a lower level university. 
Am I gonna have to do way more than most others to even get accepted besides strong letters of recommendation, a compelling argument, and work history which I’m trying to get a full time job right that’s been impossible for me. This all seems so prohibiting and unfair, but I guess that’s the way it is. 
I’m just wondering if at 32 turning 33 this month with no idea what to even purse in, is there no point if my GPA was that when I graduated; I don’t know where I’ll get letters of recommendation that will get me accepted anywhere; funds; the list goes on.

1.Get enough credits to take the CPA exam 
2.Get exposure to a different side of business and maybe work in analytics
3.Get out of a shitty environment and have a convenient excuse for leaving

I enrolled in the program but ended up getting a new accounting job which I kind of like, so I decided to do the program on a part time basis. 

Now I'm almost half way done with the program sitting at 12 credits (burnt about 13k of my own money. To finish the program I would need to spend around 19k more plus time and effort. 

I don't really enjoy the classes (though some classes are interesting), or even want to work in analytics at this point, and the 150 credit requirement to take the CPA in my state has been removed.

1lskj8a,Thinking of going back to school!,"I’ve been in and out of school for a few years now. My freshman year officially started in 2016 where I did two and half years of community college before transferring to university. I majored in English: Creative Writing with a minor in communications, originally hoping to land a job in the publishing world. Basically, I struggled with depression while being in an abusive relationship and couldn’t afford the amount of classes I was forcing myself to take (15 credit hours) and ended up failing or withdrawing classes before dropping out completely. 8 years later, and I’ve grown sooo much! After meeting my fiancé, I found a love for designing and am heavily interested in events, styling, and writing still. I have over 80 credit hours to transfer from before, but I don’t think an English degree would challenge me the way I need. 

So I am considering going back to school for either a major in communications and minor in graphic design or double majoring in communications AND graphic design with a minor in media studies. I want to work in events, or have my own business, or eventually be creative director somewhere.

1mcy4kb,How Do IBroach the Topic to My Parents that I want to change colleges?,"Hello! I don’t know if this is the right flair/tag for this, but here we go. (Also on mobile so sorry for weird formatting issues)

So, I’ve (19F) already been through two colleges at this point (currently still enrolled in my second). But at this point, I’m considering dropping out and going to community college. There’s two reasons why.

1. Money. Yeah, yeah. I should’ve really thought about it when I was in high school and shit. I regret going to a uni/college that has tuition fees.

2. I’ve been doing poorly in academics. A lot of this is my fault (I’ve been trying to rewire my study habits and going to the tutoring that’s offered, but I’m still barely making it). And I absolutely loathe how my current college grades us. It’s tests every other week and I feel like I know everything that feels relevant, but nothing that the professors think I should know.


I’ve been having a lot of guilt over my decision. I feel like a financial burden towards my parents who’ve basically wasted thousands of dollars and for what? Me barely passing classes with a “you tried?” star? Yeah, I hate the way that I feel like I’m a freeloading parasite.

I’m also starting to loathe college?? It’s been expected of me my entire life and how I felt pressured to go to college and live up to people’s expectations. Which probably isn’t healthy but I don’t know how to tackle that. Anyways, yeah. Maybe it’s just that I’ve had a lot of feelings of sadness whenever I see my grades slip, in comparison to how I did in high school (which is unfair and kind of entitled of me, since I know that high school and college are NOTHING similar to it).

But that’s besides the point. I need help trying to broach the topic with my parents. I feel like they’re going to ground me and basically (metaphorically) kill me when I’ll ask them to swap colleges again. And I can already feel the disappointment coming. I don’t know - whenever I wanted to talk about it my throat just closes up and I just avoid my feelings and thoughts entirely.

Is there a way I can get to the topic? Should I ask one of my friends to be there for support? Or should I - I don’t know? Find a better solution?",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mcy4kb/how_do_ibroach_the_topic_to_my_parents_that_i/

1kb7jxp,Update: I am no longer contemplating dropping out!,"So I had made a post on this sub at the beginning of the semester basically asking for advice because I was heavily contemplating dropping out of grad school.

And idk why, but that mindset of all things really helped. Personally, I really love the Zelda games, and putting on some Zelda ambience videos while I sit at my desk to do work has been the main reason I’ve been able to focus and somewhat enjoy doing work this semester!

1mi1kn8,Grad School Admission Chances,"Hello fellow Reddit-ers! 

I am looking at applying back for a Master's program in the US with the intent to continue on to a PhD in Europe. I am worried about applying due to the following:

* Was in a Masters program about 3-4 years ago, had to withdraw with 1 semester left due to escaping a DV situation & while it was originally an online program during Covid, the rules changed and they wouldn't let me finish my final semester from out of state.
* Dropped out of a PhD program back 8 years ago. Tried to switch from social sciences to the hard sciences, found out after the first semester it wasn't going to be a good fit.
* Most of my professors have retired, left academia all together to go to the industry, and a handful have passed over the years. Thus, I find myself with being able to get industry/professional LORs, but not so much academic LORs.

Do I still have a shot at getting in despite having a few ""stains"" on my academic record and applying with only professional LORs? For reference, my GPA is around a 3.6 for my previous Master's and a 3.5 for the program that I ended up dropping out of. 

For some context, I have one MA already - but unfortunately, it's the wrong social sciences major if I end up going to Europe for a PhD (they really like their 1:1 on verbiage and I have already been told that nearly 10 years of industry/professional experience will not compensate that my MA is in sociology rather than geography). I've kept up with conferences, but I've never had any publications past a book chapter and my thesis from my first MA and my undergrad thesis.

I have always been described as socially easy-going and until now I've excelled in academic and professional settings. The lack of guidance and mixed messages have been making my head spin. My ""advisor"" ignores my emails or tells me to be patient regarding opportunities arising. I have respectfully knocked on many doors trying to collaborate or volunteer, and seeking mentoring. There seems to be a small clique of people who get access to all the goodies, to a blatant degree that is almost comical. A few of us feel flat out ignored. I feel completely on my own and I'm not quite floundering but there is a sinking feeling that am not maximizing my time and that I will ""pass"" this program with very little show for it. I am performing well in coursework, or at least not receiving feedback otherwise. I have been making good faith efforts to connect, but I am starting to feel like nobody believes in me or cares to help me develop. I brought outside funding, so I am not sure if that is a factor.

1lfe8oh,I've become disillusioned from my Ph.D. and need advice on how to move forward,"I (M 27) am a third year Ph.D. student at a modestly ranked university in France (QS 400-500) in computer science.

I pursued my bachelors and master's at this same university, and hence my feeling is that I lacked the right exposure to other universities and campuses, that could have helped me determine the real value of pursuing a Ph.D.

In my country it takes roughly 5 years to complete a Ph.D. in this field, I currently have 3 conference publications, 1 of which is ranked CORE A, and 2 CORE B (with one of them having won best paper award). All of these publications are 2 authors with me being the first in all of them. This is because there is only one additional student that lacks motivation to do actual work.

The moment when I realized that the Ph.D. may not be for me, is that I've found myself coding and engineering during 99% of my Ph.D. studies. My writing is generally horrible, and without heavy assistance from my advisor I would have never been able to publish something. Of course I don't regret spending time in coding, as at this point I think this may be the only thing that I may be able to do after my Ph.D. studies. This is not just my speculation but also a conclusion that I've reached looking at the 2 previous students from my group that graduated and all ended up doing jobs that they could have done straight out of their masters.

At this point all I'm wondering is how should I move forward. One one hand I've spent a long time on this Ph.D., but on the other hand I don't want to fall into the sunken-cost fallacy. Given the fact that my university is ranked lowly, and that students with a similar background to mine all ended up finding jobs that are not particularly related to what they have researched, I'm currently pondering whether I should just look for a normal job now without wasting more time.

zupqyk,Just graduated. You can do it!,"Just finished my last semester with a 3.7 GPA with my bachelor's degree. I had my fair share of coming an inch within dropping out because of my mental health, struggling to pull a passing grade once or twice. Just last semester, I met with a professor in a required class, crying because I was failing, asking for a second chance on ONE assignment. He let me, and I ended up pulling an A when I started with a D. 

Your mental health matters. Take a break if you need to- take a semester off if you can afford it. Take care of yourself. Even if you're just starting, or halfway there- you're almost done. Just get to the end of this semester. Then get through the next. You're almost done, you can do it. Failing is okay. Picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and trying again is what matters. Even if you feel like it isn't worth it, or you aren't good enough: it is. You are.

Feel amazing about completing my degree, and just wanted to spread some positivity and encouragement 🖤✨",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zupqyk/just_graduated_you_can_do_it/
185yrj1,I just don't see why I should go back to college after dropping out.,"I've got my own goals and plans, but I hear nothing but bad things about college. Nothing but bad things from friends of mine, nothing but bad things online, and I only hear good things about college from family, and even they say bad things at times. 

I actually dropped out before the actual first college semester because of how discouraged, and frankly, disrespected I had honestly felt. I just truly at my core don't see why I should go back. It's also just a burden I don't even honestly *HAVE* to do, nor a burden I want. Extra taxxed money, extra schoolwork, and just overall extra pressure for pressures I'm already facing in life? Realistically, what reason do I have to go to college? If I wanna meet new people, I can always go to social gatherings, which for personal reasons I still can't do. 

My friend right now who used to vouch for it and say good things about it is currently thinking about dropping out of it.

Here's even a thread I made explaining that I owe them 800 dollars for dropping out of it: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/s/MoxjXOHYlp. You have to pay for dropping out of college, you owe them money for dropping out of college? Isn't that a form of human trafficking?

1liz3rt,Is this a good lab?,"Should I stay or run away? I’m in a bit of a dilemma and need some advice.

Context: My program is rotation based and out of my three options, only one seemed like a good fit: very flexible schedule, PI was very nice, graduate student and I seemed to work well together and had a nice vibe (no post docs and only one grad student when I rotated). I was interested in techniques and research questions, so I joined the lab and so did another student from my cohort. This is a lab where wet lab research isn’t my PI’s forte (has been doing genomic stuff since the 80’s). However the grad student spearheaded some wet lab stuff that was super cool so I decided to join.

As time went on conflicts started to arise, from “ownership” disputes on who could work on what projects, to a shared post-doc constantly cancelling on me to do certain things or “forgetting” to feed my cells when I was out of town for 3 days. I had to switch lab spaces because the senior grad student lost it with me and was super rude during a discussion so my PI suggested this move to deescalate the situation. I have had very little guidance on where to take my project ideas or how to execute them, they are either too expensive, techniques I am not familiar with or out of the scope of my PI’s expertise. My PI keeps referring me to other people for help but they cannot help me the way I need them to (they won’t share protocols, they say I can shadow them later but they will let me know—which to date hasn’t happened yet). I’ve told my PI that I feel frustrated but says that is part of the journey but I’m starting to feel nervous as qualifying period is around the corner and I have no data and no sense of concrete direction besides cool experiments that I don’t know how to do.

Meanwhile the other student from my cohort seems to have more direction and has worked with this model before, so doesn’t really need help in this area.

What do I do? I feel very lost and have contemplated dropping out of the program but also have grown so much I just don’t know what to do.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1liz3rt/is_this_a_good_lab/
pfw7vl,"I did it, I dropped out","Instead of continuing this upcoming semester, I’ve decided to drop out. I’ve been going through a lot with my health and mental health, as well as realizing my program wasn’t what I thought it would be. I feel so relieved, but now I’m stressed about how others will perceive my decision (I know I shouldn’t truly care). 

I haven’t told any of my friends or extended family yet and I’m terrified. They were all so proud of me. I was to first in my family to pursue a Master’s. I talked about this program non stop prior to starting and I’m afraid that everyone is going to see me as a quitter or a failure. 

I don’t know how to tell anyone. I don’t have any solid plans at the moment. I do have a job, but it’s not sustainable so I will be looking.

Thanks for all of the support! I know that I made the right decision for myself. My close family have all been supportive of my decision. This was not a quick or easy decision and I have been considering dropping out for about 3 months. I’m glad that I was able to recognize what was or wasn’t good for me and make a decision that I know is very scary for a lot of us. 

A little more info on my decision to withdraw:

Other than the personal health and mental health issues which played a part in my decision, I felt that my program was a disappointment. Due to the pandemic everything was online last minute and the adjustment was a struggle for my peers and professors. It seemed that education became a second thought to some of my professors. 

I was doing very well in my classes, but I also realized that I quickly started to lose interest. I was excited about grad school but I believe a big reason I applied was because I felt that I “should” go to grad school and I wanted the title, rather than truly wanting the further education. 

I decided that it was not worth continuing with something that was negatively affecting my health, something I was no longer interested in, and receiving a poor education during a pandemic that would also put me into debt to continue.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pfw7vl/i_did_it_i_dropped_out/

The college I am in atm does not have a 'license' to teach _theoretical sciences_, that is, math and physics and the like --- which CS falls under. The other college is state-funded. Some people call it a _diploma mill_ but I don't think it is one. You see, they offer 8 semesters of 'exams'. You sign up for the college, they tell you to study their books. Then, you give their exams at the end of each semester. They offer no classes, you could take 3rd-party classes though. Or just read the books, as I do already. The exams are pretty difficult. That's why it's not a 'diploma mill'. My current college is, however, Brown as in Mill-y, its exams are crap-easy.

So yeah I am dropping out of SWE (Software Engineering) to study CS. SWE is garbage. I am more of a Dan Friedman than a say, Ken Thompson.

I have 5 more classes to finish before I transfer into a 4 year university and finish my degree. I was also planning on minoring in chemistry. I’m at a point in my life where I keep asking myself “if it’s even worth it?” Everyone in my life keeps telling me that what I want is too hard or not for me and That I should just stick to an easy and quick program and just be done with school. Last time I met with an advisor, I went back home crying. She said I should be realistic and go with something that will guarantee me a job. This advisor told me that I’m not gonna make it due to financial limitations and having 2 jobs. My GPA of 3.2 is too low and that’s because I got a C in Ethics ( I was late submitting my final paper which was 50% of the entire grade in the class, but other than that, the class was super easy). What hurts the most is my family’s attitude, my sister tells me that the future I want for myself is not something that I’ll have considering that I’m a refugee from a different country and instead this is something that my children or grandchildren will have. My dad flenches whenever I speak of financial burden and as for my mom… well she never valued education. 
They always say to have a backup plan, mine is of becoming a medical interpreter to help later on with tuition costs when I’m out of financial aid money. 
I want to go to med school. I’m always ridiculed amongst the people I know when I say it. they think I’m too arrogant, not realistic and that I’m a dreamer. 
I’m starting to question myself. It’s not fun. I thought of doing different things and majoring in something “easy” but nothing is satisfying. In fact, the only time I’m happy the most is when I’m doing research for my biology class, when I’m attending a lecture, or when my classmates approach me for questions. I just got a work study as a learning assistant for an honors bio class which is the reason why I’m not dropping out of school this next semester. 
Am I not being realistic? Am I aiming too high?

1kvd1rm,I'm thinking about dropping out of my PhD program and I don't know if I should,"Hello guys, 

I don't know if I'm writing for advice or just to get stuff of my chest. I'm first year PhD student perusing thesis in the field of LMMs/GenAI. I feel very frustrated with research. There is so much going on that it's hard to keep up with 'state of the art', there are breakthroughs happening every week. Every time I think I've found a promising research topic, I discover a paper already published by Microsoft, Meta, or a university that describes my exact idea - and sometimes it's not even formally published, just pushed to ArXiv. My advisor is not very familiar with a field, but I also work with a post-doc who splits his time with a day job in the industry. He is smart and I like working with him but he usually does not have much time. Academically, my progress so far includes presenting a poster at a decent conference, reviewing a paper for another, and giving a talk at a conference. Additionally, along with my advisor and some colleagues, I co-authored a paper submitted to a reputable publisher, though it's unrelated to my thesis.

I work full time in IT but I'm not very satisfied with my job. It pays pretty well but I cannot imagine myself working there more. I started it while still doing my Master's and back then it was awesome because of the money and ability to combine work and study. Now my friends from Master's program found jobs and have 'AI Engineers' written on their Linkedin profiles even though half of them don't know what neural network actually does or they think that gradient descent is a heavy metal band, yet they'll be accumulating more industry 'experience' than me. I've tried applying for other positions, but I was rejected by one employer who expressed concern that I wouldn't be able to manage both a PhD and a demanding job simultaneously.

I feel like now (at least in my country) academic titles below PhD lost most of their meaning. Even some of the people I know who started PhDs in the same time as I did, have thesis that are so bad that their contribution to a Science will be negligible (and I'm being very generous here). For me, pursuing a PhD was a way to distinguish myself, but also to genuinely enjoy the process of research and learning. I also like the idea of having the title 'just in case' it might be beneficial for future employment.

Even when thinking about dropping out I feel guilt and the sense of missing out. I constantly think that if I pushed myself a bit harder, did some more work I will be able to graduate and write a decent thesis.

1dgwhai,Should I drop out?,"I just wrapped up my first year of college pursuing a liberal arts degree, and while I managed to finish in the top 3% of my class, I honestly hated every minute of it.

When I first started, I was excited about the broad range of subjects and the promise of a well-rounded education. But as the year went on, I found myself increasingly disinterested and unmotivated. The subjects that were supposed to be engaging felt like a chore, and the only thing keeping me going was the desire to maintain high grades.

\\As I mentioned, I finished in the top 3%. This wasn't due to passion or interest but sheer determination and the fear of failing. I felt no real connection to the courses I was taking. I realized that I was more excited about finishing assignments than actually learning the material. I joined a ton of clubs and activities, but nothing really clicked. I ended up feeling isolated and out of place. In all honesty, I’m not even sure what I want to do after graduation. The uncertainty is stressing me out, and I feel like I’m wasting time and money on something that doesn’t align with my future goals.

I’m seriously considering dropping out, but I’m torn because of a few reasons. My family is very supportive, but they have high expectations. I don't want to disappoint them. Every person for three generations has gone to college and me not doing that is not expected or accepted. I am still an adult and can make my own descions but the concern of expectations is a bit more pressing. College is still expensive, and a lot has already been invested in my education.

The other thing I can't not think of is, what if I drop out and regret it later? What if I miss out on opportunities because I didn’t stick it out?

I’m looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or knows someone who has. How did you handle it? Did you find an alternative path that was more fulfilling? Should I try switching majors, or even transfer to a different school? Or is taking a gap year to figure things out a viable option?

Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

1g3l3ln,Completely lost ,"I’m currently considering dropping out of college during my third year. For context, I started college early in my junior year of high school, achieving a 4.2 GPA a wanting to pursue mechanical engineering. My first year went well; I had good grades and learned a lot from my classes.

However, things changed in my second year when I had to get a part-time job. Initially, I managed, but when I switched to a full-time position and started taking online classes, I struggled significantly. I barely passed Calculus 2 with a 71, which led to having to deal with my mother who thinks anything below a 100 is worthless dogshit.

Now, a few months into my third year, I'm facing some serious issues. I'm nearly failing all my classes, and I had to drop Calculus 3 because I hadn't retained the material from Calculus 2. Online learning clearly hasn’t worked for me, and the combination of full-time work and being a full-time student has become overwhelmingly stressful.

In my eyes, I only have three options moving forward:

1. Stay in school and push through the stress, despite my now near-constant breakdowns.
2. Take a break from college for 2-3 years to focus on work and give myself time to recover mentally.
3. Drop out of college entirely and seek a career that doesn’t require a degree.

I have a history of mental health challenges from my younger years, but I’ve worked through them with therapy.

This would also make the decision of dropping out for unforeseen circumstances a lot easier, and if you ever wanted to pick it back up, you wouldn't have to start from the beginning. This already exists on the doctoral level. After two years, you can write a thesis and finish with a Masters.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tyactt/why_dont_universities_offer_associates_degrees/
1jbcz4d,"Struggling with My PhD, ADHD and Looking for Support","
Hey everyone,

I’m really nervous to share this, but I could use some advice and support. I’m in a PhD program in the UK that follows a 3+1 structure (one year of research methods courses, then three years for the PhD). I had health issues in my first year and considered dropping out, but in my second year, I changed supervisors and have been working on finding a solid research topic.

The problem is, I feel completely lost. My field is new to me, and I struggle with ADHD (was unmedicated from Sept to Sept last year and part of this year). I’ve been working long hours—sometimes 12-hour days—but without structure, and I end up feeling like a jack of all trades, master of none. I get overwhelmed, burn out, and then fall into a cycle of depression.

I recently found out from my landlord that my housing contract is fixed until next year, so I’ll be paying rent regardless. That realization pushed me to commit to finishing, and I asked my supervisor for clearer milestones and guidance. His response was that I should determine my own milestones, which I understand is part of independent research, but I’m struggling to structure my work effectively.

I want to finish, I really do. I don’t care about having a social life right now—I just don’t want to hate myself for failing. I’ve been sober from self-medicating with weed and trying to get my ADHD under control, but I feel like I’m constantly running in circles.

I guess I’m reaching out to ask:
	•	How do you create structure in such an independent research environment?
	•	Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way through?
	•	Any tips for breaking out of this cycle of feeling overwhelmed and stuck?

I appreciate any support or advice. Thanks for reading.

1k06h05,"Anxiety attacks, Anxiety in general.","So, Honestly, i've been slacking this year. I'm a second semester freshman and in just a couple weeks exams. I've been having so so much anxiety this semester.   
  
I have been slacking in my English class, I will admit.. and i can't seem to get my final essay done (we've been working towards it since the begg of the semester). I need to have a at least 5 page essay submitted by friday and I only have one page, and 1 article. I need at least 5 articles. I'm going nowhere and I can't find any articles because I unfortunately chose a very specific topic. I already have an F in this class so I'm pretty positive i won't pass. And I just dont want to disappoint any of my friends or family. Especially because I failed a class last semester. (I'm not sure if my dad is aware of that). 

Not to mention, im also probably gonna fail this precalc class. I need a C to pass, \*due to my degree and other prerequisites\* Currently sitting at a F as well. I also don't want to get help for this class, especially now because they would need to start with the material from pretty much the beginning of the semester. And I don't want to speak to my family about it because all they do is lecture me and are quite rude about it... My advisor isn't the best, she can be mean sometimes so i try to avoid talking to her.

All in all, im considering dropping out. But I don't want to, my major could make me LOTS of money.. but I hate school, I hate this stress and anxiety it gives me, but especially because I don't want to be the drop out in the family as both my sisters graduated.

Any advice or motivation or reccs would be amazing to have. I really need it.. My pm's are also open.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1k06h05/anxiety_attacks_anxiety_in_general/
1i8e3cf,My mom just got diagnosed with cancer. What do I do?,"My mom had a surgery a few weeks ago in which they found and removed a mass from one of her lymph nodes. She got the biopsy results back today, it’s late-stage ovarian cancer. 

I’m a sophomore preparing to be admitted into (ironically) the radiation therapy program at my school. Due to my financial situation, I cannot take a gap year or drop out (I will lose my main scholarship). 

I’ve already emailed all of my professors, my boss, and I’ve made an appointment to meet with my advisor on Monday. I don’t know what things will look like yet, how this will impact my performance, so I just let my professors know what’s going on and that I might need some flexibility throughout the semester. 

I’m sure I’ve already done everything that I can do right now, but they don’t really prepare you for this stuff. I’m still in shock and everything is a blur, I want to get everything taken care of now so that any issues can be anticipated. Is there anything else I should do? Or, if anyone has gone through something similar, do you have any advice for handling this situation? Like I said, dropping out/taking time off will be a last resort - I am planning on doing my best to keep up with my work.

Edit: I should add that I only have two in-person classes on T/Th, so I work on MWF. The rest of my classes are online. They are all pretty manageable this semester, so I think I will be able to balance my schoolwork with being at home with my mom.

Due to lack of communication from the professors who suggested the topic, the topic that I have been working on for 2 years has been repeatedly rejected by journals. I ended up working on a related area that got published in a journal and then presenting the 'not-so-popular' work as a conference poster and submitting as a conference paper. Never in my right mind would I have thought that I would become published. Heck, I was on the verge of dropping out every day. Now I'm planning to do it again.

1ebu7h5,Telling my supervisors I want to withdraw our work from an important conference,"I got accepted for a conference that is, apparently, quite important in the field I am doing my PhD. (I am basically in a field that does not quite match mine, working on something that does not quite match the field. To an extent, it is applicable, but not exactly.)

The thing is that at first my main supervisor told me that we would get funding to pay for the plane tickets. I was quite enthusiastic about it. However, just two weeks ago, my supervisor sent me an email saying that the university decided not to fund me and fund some other national students and one foreign student from a relatively poor country.

In the same email, he wrote that we would get the money from his funding (Not exactly his, I think. The government makes available every year some budget intended for my research.). 

The problem is that I do not have the money to pay for such a plane ticket + other trip expenses. I barely survive in the country on minimum wage as a full-time PhD student. 

Today I kind of hinted to one of my supervisors that maybe I would not be able to pay. He insisted that I will be reimbursed (I forgot to say.. 
Only up to 60%) for the plane tickets and went as far as to tell me that he does not understand what I want for my future since I never want to go overseas (He suggested going for a semester to another place since they do not have that much knowledge on what I do and could not help me much.). 

I think he does not understand it is not that easy in my position. I am on minimum wage and cannot continue asking my folks for money. Enough is enough. He also thinks I am not enthusiastic enough... Nor looking here and there for opportunities... 

However, how could I be? I struggle so much every single day. Can barely get myself to move out from bed. I am tired of the PhD and living abroad. Furthermore, all my problems are aggravated by being isolated in this freaking island.

What do you guys suggest? How to bring up this?
(I am also considering dropping out. I am mentally tired. The only thing that makes me keep on going is that I do not want to feel as a failure. Plus, I am just one year away from finishing my PhD and I have spent quite some money to live here.) ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ebu7h5/telling_my_supervisors_i_want_to_withdraw_our/
1861mhv,I hate my PhD.,"Yet another PhD student who hates their PhD, but venting is nice lol.

So, I am a PhD in what is hopefully my final year and since the very beginning I have absolutely hated it. My masters advisor floated the idea of doing a PhD and I wish he hadn't . By the time I finished undergrad, I knew I didn't enjoy my field, but I continued because I had already put 4 years in and I grew up really poor and was not about to waste the work I did to end up living paycheck to paycheck. 

Getting a masters was necessary for my discipline, so I continued to grad school. My primary motivation for doing the PhD was, well...money. With my masters advisors research, I could develop skills that could put me on the map for a high paying job outside of the field. That is what some of his past PhD students did, and he said they make quite a bit of money. Part of what made this not the best decision is that my masters year ended up being the worst year of my life. My mental health severely deteriorated, and I became a shell of the person I used to be. It was a big reason I hesitated to agree to the PhD. I took the entire year to decide. 

Fast forward to now. I feel like I have just stumbled my way through this program. I feel like I am actually LESS intelligent than before I came to this school. I have been published twice and will be submitting a third soon, but I just feel like my work is so inconsequential. It just hides behind this veil of jargon that makes it sound better than it is. I have so much trouble feeling motivated unless a deadline is approaching because I would rather be doing literally anything but my research. I hate having to pretend to be passionate about the field and caring about contributing to it. I don't. At all. Everything I say when talking to anyone related to my field is absolute bullshit. They think I love it, but I am internally being tortured when I have to talk about the field or my research.

All this to say, even in my very last year, the thought of dropping out comes to my mind every single day. My timeline has been a bit strange, so I am doing my oral quals this week and will be defending in less than a year. I am absolutely dreading both. If I could go back, I would just take the job offer I had after my masters. I wouldn't love my job, but idk if I'd be as miserable. And at least I wouldn't be making a poverty PhD wage. 

Thanks for reading my rant. Idk if anyone will relate, but misery loves company, so please share if you do lol.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to those who responded. I wasn’t expecting people to relate so much. I feel like we all kind of helped each other a bit in realizing it’s not just us feeling this way. Whether you choose to leave or continue the torture until the end, know you’re not alone and either choice is completely okay.

I thought grad school would kick my ass academically (and it has, but I expected to be barely passing).

Around this time 5 years ago, I was close to dropping out of undergrad and had just earned a 2.5 GPA for the Fall 2015 semester. I've never been ""smart"" academically and really struggled all throughout college.

I took a couple of years off after graduating to work and then started my PhD this year. It hasn't exactly been a smooth transition and I think this has been my most challenging semester of school yet (probably because grad school is so different), so I was constantly afraid of washing out.

1k1wkmc,I don't like my field/career and my first week of grad school is making me hate it even more,"I'm in my first week of grad school, and honestly, I'm already wanting to drop out of it (to the horror of my parents). 
Honestly, I have never even liked to study (even when I was in grade school, I disliked studying and school, the place, the people). Most of the stuff I have learned has been on my own, at my pace. So, I was kind of a good student then, I skipped a few grades, I guess my parents thought I was going to be a great scientist, physician or engineer someday. 
But the truth is I have always despised anything that requires me to learn specific stuff in an specific amount of time. Sometimes, I can learn tons of stuff on my own, with no pressure, just because I like to.

I did my undergrad in architectural engineering and I hated it from day 1, but I finished it because it was expected of me, ""everyone from our social circle has at least a bachelors degree"", and even the ""worst students"" at my high school got their bachelors degree. 

Now, in the face of unemployement and being basically unemployable even in retail jobs (somehow I'm both overqualified and underqualified for those), my mom convinced me to get a Masters degree on a local online university. I thought ""well, it sound nice enough, maybe I can go on my own pace""... and they (my mom and the school) sold me the idea that it was like that.

Turns out it is nothing like I had imagined it to be, it has strict deadlines every week, and while not required to attend the zoom lessons every day, they actually seem to be compulsory as these supposedly explain what to do with each week ""task"".

Also, none of the topics covered in class sound really interesting after actually watching/participating in two of them. The classes have been dull and boring. My classmates, mostly non existant despite being there.

I know my mom will be mad at me for making her lose her money (they won't refund it fully even if I drop out tomorrow, well, next week because of Passover), and also because this uni was the ""easiest"" way to get a masters in my country, and I know if I cannot even manage this level of academics, I won't be able to get back into academics ever again (or maybe when I'm in my 60s, who knows). So there goes my dream of being in academia, and also of fitting in with my current friends (everyone has a graduate school degree or is working towards getting one).

ihupaz,I’m so lonely and I don’t know what to do,"I’m a freshman who moved in on Monday of last week and I’m already thinking of dropping out just due to how lonely I am.

For context, I have some anxiety issues, including social anxiety, but they’re pretty well controlled (or so I thought).

When I first met my roommate (she moved in on Wednesday last week), everything seemed great and it looked like we were gonna get along really well. I also was getting along with my hallmates really well and it seemed like everything was fine.

Then I didn’t go with them to lunch once or twice (I don’t really eat lunch to begin with, and we’re only allowed to eat outside, which stresses me out because our school has a wasp problem, so I try to avoid going outside when possible). Before I know it, they have a million inside jokes that I’m not a part of, they hang out without me all day every day, and I never get invited to anything anymore.

A few days ago, I asked my roommate if she wanted to go eat breakfast with me. She said no, because she was “too tired” and “didn’t wanna get out of bed yet.” Okay, cool, totally understandable.

Ten minutes later she was fully dressed and out the door to go hang out with our hallmates. Without me.

Apparently I’m so unbearable that she feels the need to avoid me at all times now. I literally don’t see her all day. She goes in our neighbors’ room (technically not allowed due to COVID restrictions but whatever) and just sits on their floor all day doing her schoolwork (something she could just as easily do in her own dorm).

I don’t know what to do. I feel so lonely and I’m thinking of dropping out because everyone I’ve met so far seems to hate me. I don’t even understand what happened; one minute we were all getting along great and now I’m entirely excluded from the group. I don’t know what I did wrong or how to fix it and I just feel hopeless. It’s not like I can go meet a ton of new people either, due to the severe social distancing restrictions. This was my single shot and I blew it.

It’s especially problematic because I’m the type of person who’s so damn scared of going out in public alone that I just... won’t leave my dorm to eat... if someone doesn’t go with me. I’ve been surviving mostly off of the snacks I have in my dorm room. I haven’t eaten dinner in four days.

I’m just wondering if anybody has any advice at all because the loneliness is starting to really affect my mental well-being. I’m so depressed that I can’t even carry a normal conversation over text with my friends back home cause all I can think about are the feelings of worthlessness and rejection. Also, I’m gonna run out of snacks at some point lol.

edit: spelling

edit 2: Holy shit there are so many replies I can’t even respond to all of them, I’m so sorry. To those of you who are leaving supportive comments and suggestions, I see all of you and appreciate you. This outpouring of support has made me feel so much better than I was feeling before and I’ve decided to at least give it a few more weeks before deciding to drop out. I’d answer everyone if I could but unfortunately I do have classes to study for. 

To those of you who are making assumptions and think poorly of me based on this post, see some of my replies to others who share your sentiments. I’m sorry if this post gave off the wrong impression, but for the record, I don’t EXPECT my roommate to be my friend. I WISH that SOMEONE would be my friend, and I’m lonely and sad, but I don’t expect anything of any one person. Please try to see me as an individual, not the embodiment of everything you hated about your clingy, crazy ex-roommate. And preferably try to unpack that anger sometime, for your own sake.

Please try and remember that posts don’t reflect the entire story. I wrote this while actively crying, when I was in an emotional state of extreme anxiety, self-hatred and hopelessness. It’s not the most logical, well-organized thing I’ve ever written. I could have explained the situation and my feelings about it better, I’m sure, but it’s just a post I made looking for support because I feel really bad.

ye8t8u,Leaving medicine to go into social work,"I'm a third year medical student who has been struggling with school since the beginning. No one really forced me to go to medical school, but lately I have been feeling a lot of pressure to stay in medical school. Everyone always says how proud they are of me and that I should keep going, but honestly I am so miserable. I'm horrible at medicine... really bad. Everyone in my life likes to say it is just imposter syndrome, but there are many objective reasons why I am probably the lowest in my class and it's just hard to say ""the last in the class is still a doctor"" because I want to be a good doctor for my patients. I have ok grades, I'm just not solid clinically. All my  good feedback has been about how hardworking I am and how much I care socially about patients, but my clinical feedback is always poor.

So I'm in a situation where I'm juggling several options. I'm considering dropping out of medical school altogether, but I don't have a backup plan. I've considered switching into something like medical social work, because that seems to be something I'd be way better at. The people in my life think this a bad idea because it seems like I would be moving ""backwards,"" when really I think I should have done that to begin with. I've also considered asking for a LOA to get my masters in social work and then coming back if I really regretted it, but I don't see my school approving a LOA that's not research or hard science oriented. Everyone also says I should just get my MD and then pivot- but at what cost? My mental health has tanked and I have really sad thoughts about how my life feels meaningless. I have a therapist, but how much can my mental health improve if I'm in the wrong career?

TLDR: I am a struggling third year considering leaving medicine and switching into something else like social work. Any advice?

1hdp173,Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering?,"I’m at a crossroads, still deciding what I want to do for a long term career. I’m attending community college, taking some classes before transferring to another school. Currently under Engineering. High school was socially rough for me, so I’m not even taking any required classes yet. Catching up on math classes. I have plenty of time to switch majors. 

I go to Rowan College at Burlington County and I want to transfer to either Rowan University for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), or Rutgers for Computer Science. I live in NJ. 

Upon hearing about all the competition and oversaturation in CS, I switched to Engineering for my associates. However, my brother also goes to rcbc and has told me that half the kids in some of his computer science classes are dropping out. This leads me to believe that a lot of the over saturation is from students/people who don’t know what they’re doing and just want a cash grab. 

I’ve always had a natural talent for math and was a decent student, just had a rough high school experience. I honestly think I could do a better job than many students going into CS, and I think I’d prefer software over hardware work. I’m just still a bit on the fence.

I know there’s much more to CS than software engineering. Data science/engineering, AI, Cloud Engineering, cybersecurity, etc. I initially picked ECE because they learn a bit of software too, but I’m not sure that’s enough to get you very far. No point doing ECE if I wanna go into a CS field eventually, right? I just initially went for ECE to have some career flexibility. 

However, the salaries for hardware aren’t as high and the demand for them is a lot less than CS fields. CS is on the rise and i think it might be better for me to have a career in that long term…

I’m curious about the Data and Cloud sub fields as well.  I know Software Engineering is oversaturated, but there’s so much more to CS than that right? 

Should i just go for what’s more rewarding in the long run? I’ve heard and seen that hardware engineering is also very competitive and saturated. 

I don’t know what to do, and I’m curious to hear about the market for sub fields outside of software engineering.

My college campus is beautiful and is ranked very highly, however, I’m a third-year transfer student and I got placed in the worst dorms on campus. The freshman and sophomores get the best dorms because the risk of them dropping out is much higher than transfer students, so my school lays out the red carpet for them. The building I live in is extremely old and everything is falling apart, the water always goes out and maintenance has to come and fix it constantly. The ladder on my bunk bed broke and I put in a work request, but they haven’t responded, and since then I’ve been falling off my bed constantly. The code to get in for our door never works the first time, and I even had to wait outside in the cold for almost an hour before my roommate got back to let me in because my card got deactivated for some stupid reason.

In particular, the level of depth and mathematical rigor in these courses was for the most part lower than what I had seen in my undergrad courses and the experience of starting research basing almost entirely from what I had learned in undergrad has been very frustrating.

My department recently promoted an existing professor to be the new graduate vice chair. This person does not have any degrees in math or stats and instead only has degrees in geophysics. Looking at her Google scholar shows only geophysics, not math or stats, publications. Even though she has held the position of  professor at other universities, it was in geoscience, not math or stats, departments. The first time she taught a university level math class was when she taught an undergrad course in my department in 2023. I do not see why she should be the grad vice chair given she has no formal university education in math or stats and is only interested in doing research in a different field. Furthermore, I felt I got along really well with the previous grad vice chair and now I will not have that professional relationship with the new one. 

I had a conversation about dropping out of the program with the previous grad vice chair this past summer but he was able to convince me otherwise. In fact, he challenged me to get someting going with research, which I have and I am going to present something at a conference in April. With the new vice chair, I think my experience in the program will only get worse. I don't think dropping out will solve anything and I don't think transferring is realistic especially given the current political/funding situation. I feel stuck and do not know what to do next. Has anybody else found themselves in a similar situation?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1iru58x/newly_hired_graduate_vice_chair_does_not_have_any/
1iqzbvn,Is it normal to feel like you haven't made any progress after years into your master's program?,"I'm doing a part-time master's program in the humanities (I'm also working full-time). I've been doing this for more than two years now and I just don't feel like I've learned anything. My readings are still just as incomprehensible to me as they were when I started, and I'm so exhausted after trying so hard to understand what anyone is talking about for so long.

  
I still don't understand how to retain information, I still can't seem to grasp what the main points are of the books/articles we're expected to read. I take a lot of notes and I look at book reviews to help me follow the author's argument, but I still don't understand how the parts of a book/article come together to support the point. 

  
My work is not in academia but I started my MA program in the hopes that I could apply the content in my own field. I'm just feeling like maybe this was a mistake and none of this is for me or helpful for what I want to do. It's like I'm hearing people say words in class and I'm looking at words on a paper when I'm reading, but nothing processes as having any meaning. I can't think of responses or even questions to ask, because I don't even follow what people are talking about.



Perhaps it's because I didn't have much exposure to any of this in undergrad and my job requires clear, straightforward writing, which makes me resent a lot of academic writing, but I just don't feel like I have the mental capacity to grasp what I'm supposed to at this point. Maybe it's because of the stress of having a full-time job and other traumatic life situations that have happened during grad school, but I just feel like my brain is broken. For assignments I'll find a sentence/paragraph in a reading to talk about or apply in my own career context, but that's just a random sentence and I know that's not what the point is. 

  
I have good grades and so people tell me I don't need to worry, that I'm being too hard on myself. But I have to present on the book we're reading this week in class, and I've been in full panic/crying mode over having to present the main points of a book that is not comprehensible to me. 

  
I'm supposed to graduate next year, and with how hard it's been I feel like the only thing worse than continuing to put myself through this misery would be dropping out without anything to show for the difficulties I've endured the last few years. 

  
Is feeling this way, like I haven't made any progress from where I first started, normal in grad school? Does anyone have any advice on how to continue? I've just been really sad over the reality of my program being much different than I'd hoped.

15gtn6a,Leaving PhD for dream role in industry,"I hope this post can help someone, one way or another and normalize dropping out. 

I did so well during my masters, but I was so unhappy doing my phd. I started January 2020, covid happened and circumstances cancelled 2 sets of potential projects back to back. I won a big national award and passed my candidacy exam but my third set of projects werent going great… i decided to drop out. 

It was terrifying job hunting aggressively for 2-3 months. I applied to 200+ roles. I had one interview where I didn’t make it to the second round. But after that I found the role i just accepted an offer for!!! Great salary/benefits, adjacent to my research field in medical devices/psychology…. Im so excited.

I started again in January this time juggling a full time job and I'm running into the same issues I had a year ago -- lack of progress on my thesis.

I finished all of my coursework. In terms of my thesis I'd say 85-90% of the research is done and just needs to be written. I've only written like \~15%. Honestly most will just be plots and pictures not even writing. My advisor wants me to defend late April and idk if I can make it.

What's rotting my mind right now is asking for **another extension.** I can see myself pulling through and finishing this whole thing up in 4 weeks -- I've been in worse horse sh\*t and piss. But this time around I feel like I lost myself. I've been working on this degree for three years now and I'm still struggling.

Dropping out is an option. heck if I bring up an extension discussion with my advisor he might just drop me. I'm still shocked that he's been with me this entire time Idk what he see's in me. Theres a voice in my head saying ""you can wrap this up in 4 weeks. you can do it. it will be done."" But then there's the dark side which is what I word vomited just now.

I have no one to talk about this with and it makes me completely sad I feel so alone and weak.

1gcatb0,pros and cons about dropping out ," Me and my therapist sat down to make a pros and cons list about dropping out or transferring to another program. She drew 4 quadrants on a paper and named them “pros of staying” “cons of staying” “pros of leaving” “cons of leaving”.
She said go. I talked and I listed things and then she ripped the paper out and gave it to me. 
I had 2 “pros of staying” but 7 “pros of leaving”.

It all made sense I’m miserable in this program and I desperately want to leave. My mental health would be so much better, my physical health and my life would be more happy. 

I realized this but I can’t drop out. 

So, make a pros and cons for any situation/relationship/job/choice. Even though you might not follow through with it, it will atleast give you a clear understanding of what’s inside of you instead of constantly overthinking the possibilities.

1iefkgt,Classmate goes full AWOL. Not sure what to do,"I am currently studying my first year (first time) in college. My class is quite small, we consisted of 10 students in the beginning but 2 decided to drop out only halfway through the first term. Being new in town, i had a nice classmate show me around  as he also lived in the same town as me and we became somewhat acquainted

Fast forward. The day after our programming examination, he all of a sudden stopped coming to school and he also stopped all form of communication with me and my classmates. I have called him 2-3 times and he just hangs up on me. 


He did not seem the type to just disappear like that nor show any disinterest in the program but i could be wrong. I wouldnt say we were close friends as we only hanged out in school but we regularly send eachother memes and such after school time.

Is this common amongst university students? Or should i investigate this further. The fact that he hangs up on my calls means he is still alive but i am puzzled to why he cant just give some information if he is planning on dropping out or if he just needs a break. 

I am not sure if this is the right sub but hopefully some of you have experienced this and maybe know what the usual outcome to such behaviour might be. Thanks",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1iefkgt/classmate_goes_full_awol_not_sure_what_to_do/
1ixc33j,should I drop out? 6 weeks left in a 1 year course but I'm kinda miserable,"(Edit! I added an update at the end of this post also) basically, I'm just over 6 weeks away from finishing a pre-college one year course. I like the content but because one of the main instructors was absent for the first 6 weeks of the course we are moving through projects and assignments really quickly. I was stressed about it but doing ok-ish until I got sick for 3 weeks in January and even with extensions it seems likely I'll just fail a couple of my modules because my work is handed in so late it wont be graded. 

Not going to get into my mental health much here because of the post rules - but it's been pretty bad since this course started. I think I may have depression or something at the moment but I'm slow to throw labels at things. I'm seeing a therapist but the sheer amount of work that I know I just dont have the time to catch up on, and the sense of like shame that I can't do this course as well as I thought is messing with me. I've always been good academically and at the start of the year I was one of the better students in many of the modules, but that is no longer the case and they all seem vaguelly like disappointed? when I tell them I'm planning on doing Arts next year instead of this course they all look at me like I've failed or something. I've been fairly stable mental health wise for the past 4 or 5 years so this is quite unusual for me

The way this course is structured (3 2/3 hour long classes with one half hour gap in the day, only about 13 people in the course and a small campus so no social stuff at all really) doesn't suit me at all. I have pretty significant Adhd and even on meds I've really struggled with the structure of this course. We get loads of work to do at home also and it's so hard for me to get anything done at my desk after coming home at the end of the day. The college library also has really limited hours so I can't even work there really.

 Its also all assignment based rather than exam based and its taken me longer than others to get used to that because of my Adhd. I also have to do 40 hours work experience between now and the course finishing, so I'm looking at a very heavy 6 weeks ahead with that also (8 hours a week work experience on top of 26 hours in college and then more hours working from home as well as that). It also seems like because of how burnt out I am that I won't be able to do the work experience projects as well as I'd like, and I'm worried that will damage my relationship/reputation with the person I'm doing work experience with, I really don't want her to see me as unreliable.

I did quite well in my exams in secondary school and will for sure get a spot in the Arts course in my local university for September based on those grades, so I dont need to do well in or even pass this course to get in. I'm fairly confident that the arts course will suit me more, it's more interesting to me content wise, there are more essays (which I really enjoy writing, my current course has almost none) and less contact hours with more gaps in the day, and a bigger campus so I can have more of a social life (a few of my friends study there also).

The pure amount of hours this course takes for me to do means I have way less/no time to do things I care about (make art, write, see my friends, have a part-time job, my youth theatre group). The course was also not that expensive fees-wise, so it's not been a massive financial investment 

So yeah idk if that made any sense. Basically do I pull though 6 weeks of unnecessary slog that is stressing me out to the point of loosing my will to live, but get to put a solidly useful qualification on my CV and have my parents not be disapointed in me. Or do I drop out, fuck around with a part time job and focus on my creative hobbies before going into college in September as a fresh start (and if I'm still not right then I'll go up on my adhd meds I'd say)

Update (23/06/2025)
I did not follow the advice reddit gave me and it all turned out ok. I had a very tough week after making this post and made the decision to drop out. I still did my 40 hours of work experience after I dropped out and learned that I did not actually want to do the sort of job that I was learning how to do in that pre-college course (It was in digital media btw, so like video editing, Blender, graphic design, html, photoshop, Adobe Animate all that sort of thing). 

Working alone on a laptop watching the same footage over and over again was making me go a little nuts, I also was not good at actually editing video and getting it done on time so I think I can safetly say it's not the career for me. Since then I volunteered with a local theatre/art festival, applyed for and got accepted to this program for new playwrights and have a job I really enjoy working in a grocery shop for the summer.

I think I have learned that I am one of those insane people who really enjoys talking to people all day and need to organise my life and career plans around that. I am specifically planning on studying English and Sociology next year, and continuing to volunteer for different festivals and things in my city because I really enjoy that and then maybe after my BA saving to do a masters degree in Event Managment or something else in that sphere. It did take me about a month to find a job, but since then I have been able to have enough money to see my friends more (coffees and bus fares can get expensive) which has been good, and I was able to afford to visit France for a few days with some friends. I have also been saving up a good chunk of what I have been earning also, which is nice to be able to do.

Most of my worries with dropping out were to do with how people would judge me for it or what it would say about me as a person if I did, but I have since learned some pretty good life lessons about that now. Its been really nice to just be a person for a little while, I have enough time and headspace to book my own doctors appointments, buy my own groceries and just generally get more practice in being an adult person in the world before I properally start college.

The other day I just found out I have some serious health issues (my doctor is thinking I might have cancer, still have to run more tests.) It runs in my family, a bunch of women die young in my family from it, I have made peace with it. However, that on top of my insomnia has made me actually miserable.

I am currently at University, but I decided to drop out, and I am looking into getting an online degree. It has nothing to do with me not trying hard enough, I just simply realized how much I hate school here. I have no friends, I have nothing here that is worth saving. I am in one of the best schools for my major, specifically for education, but I just no longer feel a desire to be here. 

There are other things going into this as well. As I live a few hours away from home, it is not easy seeing a doctor. I do not have a car (sold it for textbooks lol,) so the constant back and forth has been so expensive. With my insomnia, I keep staying awake for 2-3 days at a time and falling asleep in dangerous places (school bathrooms, one time on a bench, on my bathroom floor.) I am concerned for my safety at this point.

Due to my McKinney Vento status, I do not even know what I am going to do in regards of transferring financial credits. I am dropping out now, I can't stay anymore. I am probably going to just pack my things and not come back during spring break.

I've had a few points over the past 2.5 years where I was considering dropping out - I raised massive safety concerns and was all but ignored and dismissed when looking for help, that really piled on stress. I managed to push through them then - I spoke with my postgrad office (who were great!), my colleagues, and my supervisors (who were just dismissive). I got through those points previously because I could take some time to go a bit easier on myself - I'd make up the time somewhere else along the line. Well now my work is actively not going well in terms of getting results, there's still massive concerns- mostly the same ones, lots of external disruption affecting my work - equipment failures, maintenance etc and it's all just feeling like too much. I'm spending nights unable to sleep, or waking up in the early hours stressing and unable to not worry about work.

It's feeling like I'm only in this now for a sunken costs fallacy, but the thought of another year and a half of this gives me so much dread. And that's before thinking about putting it all in a thesis. I try to tell myself that I'm past halfway, just finish it but that just doesn't feel convincing enough.

sm0o5i,The GRE is BS/I’m sad~ /:,"Yeah so I really wanted/want to go to grad school, but it kind of seems like it’s on the back burner because everyone says it’s not worth the money and I know they are right, but a part of me just wants to do it for myself. I got into an MBA program at my undergrad school bc I had a high GPA. I dropped my classes days before it started because I got a FT job 3 months prior and everyone, including my boss, said it would not help me what so ever. I feel like a failure low key for dropping out of it and I think if I tried to go back into the program, I would have to reapply and they would def want GRE scores. 

I originally planned on obviously taking the GRE to try and get into a better school/program. Long story short, I took the GRE 6 months post graduation, and I bombed it. I don’t do well on standardized testing, but I also probably didn’t study as much as I should have. I have ADHD, and because there’s so much ambiguity with the actual test material, it feels impossible to prep for. I’ve honestly just kind of given it up, and felt content with that for a month, but now I’m sad about it again. 

One of my friends called me yesterday and told me that her boyfriend took the test for the first time (I had been giving her/him advice for several months about the GRE) and he scored like a 320. It’s obviously great for him, he can go to any school he wants to with that score I’m sure. It stings for me a bit though. I scored below a 300, that’s all I will say. I’m depressed already and none of this helps my self esteem and I just hate that I have to take a test to prove my worth, as if nothing else I’ve ever done matters. It’s ridiculous. These tests are rigged against people like me and it’s all for capitalistic profit. It’s just a bunch of bullshit. 

We can’t say “oh you are worth more than your score.” Then why are we taking it? I’m worthless as an applicant without a certain score. I know, “we’re all in the same boat”. But are we? Does everyone have a learning disability? Did everyone grow up with the same academic resources? Absolutely not. It’s not a mistake that rich people do better than poor ones.

It seems like anxiety has *greatly* increased in our students. The anxiety accommodations are out of hand and some of us are ready to call ""bull shit"" on the entire thing.

However, my spouse pointed out that higher ed has fully cooperated in creating the idea that *everyone* MUST go to college in order to be ""successful"". Traditional admissions standards have been tossed aside so that colleges can fill their incoming classes. Students find themselves enrolled in classes that, at best, they are marginally prepared for and that they don't really want to take.

They're still being told that this is the only path to success. Dropping out is not just a short-term failure, it will ruin their entire lives.

I had to talk to her because the way my program is, you have to tell her why and if your reason for dropping out grants you the ability to come back (so dropping out bc of bad grades or just cause means you have to wait 2 years before coming back, dropping out for medical/special reason means you can come back next semester or whenever). The other time was her emailing me about applying for a scholarship. 

I got a voicemail where the only context was her asking me to call back in a flat voice. I for sure thought I was cooked, bc my friend accidentally broke my laptop a week ago so another offered to help me with the homework since I lost the file where I had done it. 

I call back and she’s just checking in, making sure us seniors were being taken care of, and saying she has a scholarship opportunity and asking if I need one. My school is already paid for through academic scholarships so I told her it’s fine and to give it to someone else that may need it but Jesus my hands were shaking after hanging up.

1j8k97w,College and life is so hard,"So I began going back to college recently but it has been stressing me out so much. I'm going in for a degree in Engineering or at least something i enjoy doing.


My parents were in the military and my mom is Native American which has allowed me to go to college for free which Im aware not many people get that kind of opportunity.
Im taking Math (Algebra), English, and Engineering because I wanna become an engineer some day. It's been two years since I've taken a math class but it's been so stressful. I failed my math exam with a 9/100 which is just sad. Never in my life have I failed a math class so badly even when I struggled, I still managed to pass but this was just awful. It doesn't help that I've been stressing so much lately and I'm dealing with so much at once. My mother passed away back in November (on veterans day...) which motivated me into going to college. But I'm having to deal with college and a billion other things. I work a 12hr/3-4 days a week at Tesla. I've had to work overtime a lot lately because I'm struggling on money. I had to pay my roommate back because I borrowed too much from him which at least that was all finally taken care of but still caused me stress. And then there's my mom's bank I have to take care of, the VA, putting things into my name like insurance (since she had it under her name before). And then moving out of my apartment because the assholes at the office decided to park a stupid golf cart in front of my garage door causing me to park my vehicle in a different spot and not even a day later, it got towed (which technically was the office's fault even though I contacted them, no response). I had to pay 300 bucks to the towing company which was bs. Thats not even counting the dozen other things our apartment is screwing us over for (taking 4-5 months to fix a door or an oven for example). So now my roommate and I agreed to moving out because we had it with their games. I'm still not happy my roommate decided to wanna move out but I agreed and understood his view and reasonings but still. I am gonna move in with my uncle and aunt so that may help. So much crap and more I probably haven't mentioned and it's caused me to struggle in college. I'm managing to pass English and Engineering at least but my math class has really gotten bad to the point I'm considering dropping out for the semester and trying again this summer. I have moments were I stress because I cant even concentrate on a single problem or I just freak out and break down crying. Doesn't help the fact my dad's side of the family has had a bad history of heart problems and heart attacks. I have lost so much sleep to the point I occasionally black out at work for a few seconds is night shifts.. my break times is either I work on homework or sleep and even then it's not enough.

1iy6jld,To dropout or not?,"I am a 28M PhD student from Southeast Asia, in a top US university doing ML and Computational Mechanics, and I am currently thinking of possibly dropping out of the program. I will be doing my preliminary exam soon, and after that if I decide to drop out, I can leave with a Masters.

I still do like the work that I am doing, however my values have shifted after 1.5 years in now. Throughout these 1.5 years, I have been traveling back to my homecountry during each break (winter and summer), to see my family and my girlfriend who we have decided to happily get married this year. I stayed for 2 months during the summer, and worked towards my research, and got a paper out last year from my remote summer research.

This year, I have been told by my PI that it will not be great for the group, and it will be too much to leave for more than a month, and I can now only do one month once a year moving forward (even with remote research). We have talked about this, and since I am attached to my life at my homecountry, my PI decided that I could work towards early graduation in less than 2 years. However, I now value the frequency and length of stay of traveling back home throughout the program. I realized I am basically tied in the grad school loop now, which have no certainty of how much travel I can do in the coming future, and that is important to me. 

I understand that operating a Lab is just like a small business, and its not great seeing your employees go off on remote work for months. Unfortunately, its just that I (we) have differing values now, and I value the people and connections around me. 

I started the PhD aiming for a chance to work in the intersection of Science and AI, after some industry experience as a ML engineer, as I noticed some downsides of (past) algorithms during my time as an engineer. Now, most of my research (the technical details, formulation and the ideation) has been driven by me, with my advisor giving minimal inputs as he is busy. 

I believe that I am capable enough of standing on my own with my experience in industry, and even with a Masters, I will land somewhere, where someone will value my worth. I also want to start my own startup one day, to work on AI4Science. 

Any advice is welcome, and I appreciate them. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1iy6jld/to_dropout_or_not/
1g2zniu,No idea if it's worth returning to school for a PhD after earning a Masters (PoliSci),"I'll try to keep this as brief as I possibly can and only include relevant info.

In the fall of 2020 I began my Masters in Political Science, with no specific specialization. Due to illness and other problems, I only finished in the fall of 2023, after nearly dropping out, with no thesis (only a literature review) and a 3.16 GPA.

After graduation, I found out the cause of my illness and fixed it, tested for and began receiving treatment for ADHD I didn't know I had, and began looking for work in my field. I have no interest in working in politics due to the vitriolic nature of US politics, but I've been greatly interested in foreign affairs, diplomacy, and history since I was an undergrad.

Here's the problem: No one's calling back. To date I have 400+ applications to the private and public sectors combined with 5 interviews total. I believe that the reasons behind my lack of success include, but are not limited to, my lack of specialization, no internships or formal research in a field related to what I studied, and a poor academic record in grad school (I had a 3.3 GPA in undergrad and graduated on time, but I struggled a lot more with my ADHD for some reason in grad school).

Before you ask, I did ensure my resumes are ATS compliant, I am doing my best to tailor my resumes and cover letters for the positions I'm applying to. Very few responses. 

I'm 27 now. My parents are extremely understanding of my situation and my... special needs, so to speak, and they're willing to help support me through school (I work in education at the moment). I personally greatly enjoyed the research and study aspect of my field, and I'd like to specialize in international relations (conflict, diplomacy) if I did pursue a PhD. I would also be doing this for internship and research opportunities that I missed out on in my masters program.

I have begun the application process with the school I attended for my masters, and I will receive, at the absolute minimum, 24 credit hours towards a 72 hour PhD program (and a maximum of 36). My only questions are whether or not my PhD will actually be looked at as ""credible"" considering how poorly my masters went, how I had no internships or research until I began my PhD, and how long it will have been from beginning my masters (fall 2020) to actually finishing the PhD program (which will begin in the fall of next year and probably take 3 years).

If you have any questions or I didn't mention something I should have please let me know.

1b8grqa,I feel like the most stupid PhD student,"Hello everyone. I’m looking for a little advice. 

For some context, I’m a third year PhD student in Electrical Engineering. I have a masters in the same field and a bachelor's in mechatronics engineering.

To put it bluntly, I feel like I am the most stupid PhD student in my research group and university. I’ll explain in detail why I feel this way. Going back to my high school years, I wasn’t a good student. I wouldn't pay attention in class or study at home. In class often I would end up distracted by my imagination or talking to classmates, and at home, I often preferred to waste time on the computer using social media, reading fiction books, watching anime, etc. At this time, I used to get average (and sometimes barely passing) grades on tests and homework. Due to this behaviour, I got admitted to a good and decent university in my country, but not a prestigious one.   

At university, this behaviour continued for a couple of years. I usually didn’t pay attention in class, and as a result, I got barely passing grades. At some point, I got interested in one subject and decided I would like to get a master's degree, so I took my education more seriously. However, the damage was already done and my grades were mediocre at best.  

When I finished my undergrad thesis, with the support of my advisor I applied to the master’s program in electrical engineering at the best university in my country and got accepted. I did relatively well in my courses (I had very good classmates who helped me a lot through our class projects. I’m embarrassed to say that in a couple of courses, they took the majority of the project load). Finally, I completed my master’s thesis, defended and completed the program (however, due to the pandemic and my laziness, it took longer than expected). At this point, I had already decided to enter the PhD program at the university, so I applied and got accepted. 

In the PhD program, I feel lost. The papers are difficult to understand (not impossible though, I’m just new to this topic in my research field), and I have forgotten a lot (or most) of the background material for an engineer. For example, nowadays I only remember the rules of differentiation and how to differentiate polynomial functions. For the rest, I have to use tables. Integration is off the table, I don't remember how to integrate (unless it is a polynomial function). The same with multivariable calculus and differential equations. This is just a sample of the things I have forgotten, and due to this, I feel depressed. 

I thought about dropping out of the program for most of last year, but I really like the subject i’m working on even though I sometimes (or most of the time) don’t understand what is being discussed by my colleagues. I also have made advances with my work, and have some running simulations and a conference paper (I have several conference papers and one journal paper, but most of them are from my undergrad and master’s years). Nowadays I’m trying to catch up on background material (I try to spend one hour daily doing mathematics) while working on my research most of the day. 

I don’t know what to do. This year I have to start doing experimental work and I haven’t worked with laboratory equipment in 5 years. Many of the machines that I have to use are new to me. I am not strong theoretically nor experimentally. My motivation has taken a hit as I compare myself with my lab colleagues and colleagues from other universities. 

Please, I would appreciate any advice you have for me. I know that I wrote a lot, but I wanted to get this off my chest and writing this long post helped. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1b8grqa/i_feel_like_the_most_stupid_phd_student/

I'd like to continue working on my PhD to keep earning my stipend until I get a job.

Does anyone know what the formal process for dropping out of a PhD in UCL is? And is there a formal notice period? Because I don't see any mention of one in the graduate degree handbook or in the contract I signed.

I'm just trying to determine how and when I need to tell the university I intend to quit.

1i48o1m,Is it worth it for me to apply to grad school right now?,"So, here’s the thing. I’m extremely burnt out and I want to take a gap year (or even just a gap half-year). I’ve been neglecting my mental health a lot over the last 2 years and I’ve just started therapy, which has helped me unpack some things. 4th year has been pretty demanding and while I initially intended to keep up with stuff like scholarship applications, reaching out to professors, and asking for LORs, I really have not accomplished any of these things. I do well in my classes, but I don’t make the effort to get to know my profs and I’m not involved in many extracurriculars. The clock’s ticking and I’m anxious and I do not think that I can realistically do any of this at the moment, especially during a busy semester like this. But if I took a gap year, I think I could come up with a good plan of what to do and figure everything out. I also had a lab-based class last semester where I kept making careless mistakes and my lab partner was visibly annoyed at me, which has me second-guessing if I’m cut out for this line of work. I’ve signed up for a field course in the spring, have just joined a local field naturalists club, and am applying for summer internships for my program, so those’ll hopefully help me figure that out.



I’m also second-guessing what I want to do my Master’s in (I’m a biology student and was thinking of doing my Master’s in bio, but am now also entertaining the thought of doing it in journalism). I want to make some more money and hopefully learn some practical skills that I’ve been neglecting (like learning how to drive). I also strongly suspect that I might have ADHD and want to get tested for that — I think it would be better to go into grad school being properly medicated and having better study strategies rather than risking crashing and burning and dropping out. I think the ADHD might be partly responsible for the burnout I’ve been experiencing lately and my time management skills are atrocious. Sometimes I don’t have enough time to pursue hobbies outside of academia anymore just because I’m a serial procrastinator and I keep getting overwhelmed way too easily.



I’ve been fortunate enough to have had my tuition paid for by my parents throughout my undergrad, something that I’m thankful for. Both of my parents think that taking a gap year would be a huge mistake and that I’d regret it — personally, I don’t think so. I live in a different city than them, so if I did this, I wouldn't be freeloading and I'd ideally be less financially reliant on them. They are urging me to apply for grad school right now and then just defer if I really need to, but since I’m pretty dead-set on taking this gap, I think that’d be a waste of time and money. They’ve offered to cover application fee costs, but that would make me feel even worse — I really don’t want to waste my parents’ money on this. Every time I think about applying right now, I swear my brain enters fight-or-flight mode and I tense up and suddenly feel overwhelmed by everything. It even distracts me from properly studying for my current classes. When I think about taking a gap year, I can suddenly focus and feel calm. I think that’s my body telling me that I need a break. I just don’t know how to break the news to my parents. Should I bite the bullet and just apply for grad school, or should I take the gap year?



TL;DR: Want to take a gap year because of burnout, wanting to get more practical experience, and wanting to make more money. Parents don’t think it’s a good idea and want me to apply anyways. I’m extremely ill-prepared and anxious and just don’t want to think about it at the moment.

1gxn3a4,My college might be demanding tuition money ,"Hello all, I recently dropped out of my college at the end of October. I withdrew in the middle of a semester, so I didn't take all the classes for that semester. (Specifically it seems to be Semester 4).

Today I received some papers in the mail from the university. I'm not entirely sure, but it seems as if I owe tuition for the ENTIRE semester 4, including the classes I never took.

Also, there is a place on the paper where it says: ""Payment Due to [insert university name]"" and then it lists a dollar amount that's an enormous amount of money. Like, thousands of dollars. And if I'm understanding correctly, it's due right now. (The paper says ""PAYMENT DUE UPON RECIPT"").

I didn't fill out my FAFSA for the current academic year (yes... I know that was stupid of me). Is this why they seem to be asking for a payment right now? But I'm confused. I checked their website and it looks like loans were disbursed to my account in October. And how was I still able to take classes and receive loans without doing the FAFSA?

What can I do about this payment notice? I'm nowhere near being able to pay this amount. Can I  ask them to delay this huge payment until next spring? (That's when my student loans are due.)

When I withdrew from the school, nobody even told me that I'd have to pay immediately. I talked to a couple of staff members on the phone, and they didn't warn me that I'd have to pay RIGHT AFTER dropping out.



And how can I convince them to let me not pay the money that's for the classes I never took?

Also, I have a certificate from them. Can they withhold my transcript or revoke my certificate if I don't pay? I'm in NC, by the way, and the college is in FL.

1h516zj,What is this addition and subtraction you speak of?? (overall course grade calculations),"I learned years ago that weighted averages are way, way too hard for my freshmen to calculate. I teach a quantitative course that assumes you know how to take averages, so my (former) go-to when students asked about their overall grade was to tell them to calculate it themselves using the weights in the syllabus, making sure to average by category. Yeaaah, that worked until 2022 or so when sudents stopped being able to take averages, even when I provided them the formula.

So I thought--they should be able to *add*, right? So I switched my system to the popular ""you can earn up to 1000 points"" system. 1000 is a nice number, it's easy to see what your grade is, just move the decimal point two places to the left after adding up all your points. I set up my LMS to do that for students. You'd think there would be no more ""what is my grade right now and what is the highest grade I can get in this class given the little work I've done so far"" emails, right? Hahahahaha *you would be wrong!!!* 

I let students ignore one bad exam grade and move its max possible points to the final. Eh, people have bad weeks/months. The final is comprehensive so they have to learn the content anyway. But without fail students are absolutely *mystified* by what moving the points to the final entails. I tell them it means the final will be worth X + Y points instead of X points. And then I get students who missed an exam and thus have no points from it and have elected to move the points from that exam to the final, sending me emails like, ""Is there any way I can possibly pass this class? The LMS says my grade right now is a 50% 😢 "" 

These are students who *know that their final is worth a huge chunk* of their overall grade because they *already chose* to move the points from one exam onto the final (like, they reached out to me weeks ago to move those points). The points values of everything are made extremely clear both on the LMS, on the syllabus, etc etc. These are students who could easily get high Bs if they earn max points on the final, asking me if it's possible for them to pass the class. Can freshmen not even add anymore?

I'm so tired of this learned helplessness and the utter waste of my time from all these ""Just to confirm that.... INSERT THING THAT IS CLEARLY PRINTED ON THE SYLLABUS HERE"" and ""Can I possibly pass the class please tell me I can't do basic addition"" and other learned helplessness/risk-averse time-wasting garbage. I can't wait until we get AI assistants in higher ed that can act as reassurance modules for hyper-anxious innumerate students, because I swear a good 40% of my email interactions are mitigating these issues.

Have you noticed the bottom dropping out like I have? I used to complain in 2021/2/3 that students were regressing to the intellectual maturity of middle-schoolers. I *wish* that were still the case.

Everything follows from there and I told him about everything. For a moment, it felt better. My dad tried his best to console me even if a lot of things he said I feel didn't 100% resonate.

So I just wonder if I screwed up on that aspect. I always wanted to break out of my loser self and be a strong man who can handle life's problems on my own. ",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/12zzhoy/is_it_weird_for_a_collegeage_20m_to_be_talking_to/

1ggph6v,Have I destroyed my life?,"Hello everyone, l am a tirst year student in olEM In US coming from europe. I've been struggling with some taughts for a while and I needed some advice from people who are actually in academia. Any advice would be much appreciated. A little bit of background. I've completed my undergrad and Masters in europe both in engineering. For PhD I've applied to US and I was able to get accepted by two schools, lets call them school A and school B.
School A is a top 10 school in reputation, but the program I was in has just recently started, (just over 10 years) and school is not famous for its engineering programs. However, it was able to attract giant names from my field and it has very good ties with National Labs located in a big city.
School B is a state school, with a mediocre ranking but a legend in my field. However, they lost all of their big names recently and faculty was very young.
The decision process for me was very though but I decided to go with School A mainly for 2 reasons:
Brand name, the research was very similar to what I did in Masters. When I was conversating with one particular Pl from school B during the decision process, l've got starstruck. He was super kind, all his students seemed like really liked him and his research was super interesting. I really wanted to worked with him, but I couldn't dare to change my mind last second. Mostly because, his research is very distant from what I did before (he is a computational mathematician and I was an experimental soft materials), and I was afraid if he wouldn't take me I didn't have any one that I was too interested in that school. Now I recently completed my first year in School A and, oh boy, do I regret decision. First of all I cant forget about the rese. of that Pl from School B. And it kills my motivation for my own research. Second of all, talking with and talking with and seeing with 6th or 7th year PhD students from my lab, I realize that this program might not be that great for career as well. They are struggling really hard with find a job or graduating. One of them actually told me that one of my PIl am co-advised), has actually killed all their grad students careers.
And now I am terrified. I am afraid that I will never like my research again and spend 7 years of my life for something that I will not care and wont be even able to find a job. Currently, things are not that bad.
My Pls are happy with my work. (Both of them are giants in their field. One of them is an
experimentalist, the other is computation) I was able to get some results and might even publish soon.
Yet, these thoughts are really hard to overcome. So l am undecided about what to do. Should I just go on with it and try to love my research? Should I drop out, and re-apply? I am 28 years old and re applying seems really scary, especially seeing all my friends progressing in their lives. I am also afraid that dropping out from a program would really kill my chances of having an acceptance again from a good school. And now I feel like I destroyed my life and feel really stuck.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ggph6v/have_i_destroyed_my_life/
1fmmanr,how tough is phd? seeking advice...,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been hearing a lot about how tough a PhD can be, but I’m curious to get some perspective. I know people often talk about PhDs being extremely challenging, but I wonder if that’s mostly from those at top-tier institutions. To me, a PhD seems more manageable compared to cracking competitive exams for college admissions, which are notoriously difficult. I’ve heard of so many people struggling with those exams, but not as many dropping out of their PhDs—though I’m sure it happens.

So, here’s a bit about me: I’m an average student with a decent work ethic but not the best memory or practical skills. I can work hard on assignments and keep at it until it’s done. I think that consistency could help me complete a PhD, even if I’m not aiming to be the best. Unlike exams where there are right and wrong answers, a PhD seems to be more about persistence and writing. Even if my work isn’t published in top journals, my main goal is to complete the degree to boost my career.

Are there others here who completed their PhD with similar goals, perhaps at a not-so-prestigious university? How was your experience, especially if you consider yourself to be at a low to medium level of intellect?

**Considering PhD in Education Instead of Engineering/Technology**

Initially, I planned to pursue a PhD in engineering or technology since I have a bachelor’s in engineering and a master’s in education. However, I realized that these fields often involve practical components, like using computer software for testing and research. I’m completely unsure about how to use these tools and uncertain how much guidance a professor would provide.

Now, I’m leaning toward doing a PhD in education, but I’m aware that this field involves a lot of surveys and data collection. Are there people who just copy survey results from the internet or generate fake data? How do universities verify if you actually performed these surveys, or is it possible to get by without doing them?..Not that , I intend to , but just really curious on this front…

**PhD Time Frame and Progress**

Regarding the time frame, I know the minimum duration is often three years, but I’m puzzled about why it takes this long, especially for people like me who might not be doing groundbreaking research. For those just aiming to complete the degree, does it really take three years?

Does the professor give you sections of your thesis to complete every few months after your coursework is done? What if the project is simple, and you finish early? Do students pretend they’re still working on it to avoid seeming like they’re taking it too lightly?

I actually believe this might happen a lot. For students who choose simpler projects, they might finish their work much earlier but, knowing that the minimum time limit is three years, they could end up pretending that they're still developing or refining their research. This way, they appear to be taking the appropriate amount of time, even if the project didn’t require it.

  
**Protecting the Turf: Is the Toughness of a PhD Overemphasized? (to stop new people from entering the domain?)**

  
Sometimes, I feel that the toughness of a PhD is overemphasized, especially by those who aren’t aiming to conduct groundbreaking research and are simply looking to complete the degree. I often hear people in this category claim that a PhD is very tough, and I can't help but think that they might be exaggerating or trying to discourage others from pursuing a PhD. It reminds me of how professionals in niche fields like aviation or marine engineering often talk about how difficult their courses and lives are, but when I’ve looked into those fields, they seem easier compared to other demanding courses, like those in IT. It makes me wonder if people in these fields, including PhD holders, are just trying to protect their turf and maintain the exclusivity of their degrees. Why do so many people, who aren’t engaged in major research, still insist that a PhD is so difficult? Is it just a way to prevent others from entering this relatively small group of degree holders?

Again, I'm not talking about the PhD holders who actually do groundbreaking research. I have huge respect for them, and I can understand that the toughness might be way out of my league. But I’m just referring to those people like me who just want to complete a degree, write a generic thesis, and a paper that might hold no significant value, yet still, those people say it’s very tough.

 

I’d appreciate any insights on these questions!

I was considering dropping out. My advisor was encouraging and pushed me to stay saying that my work is good. But the difficulty is that he is not really a specialist of my topic.

If i drop out, i was thinking about a possibility to start another phd in the same discipline (different but possibly related topic) in my home country (also Europe) after some time. This would give me financing and the possibility to start a new topic. Is this crazy? Do people do this?

1hxmbr8,starting the semester strong & recovering from post-burnout bad habits [US],"Hello all! The **TL;DR** is basically in the title, but the slight expansion is: I have been *very* burnt out for quite awhile, and have become very used to procrastinating and using various vices (mostly excessive reading) as escapism. As I am moving forward into this new semester, I'm feeling hopeful and mostly prepared, but my burnout-vices have become extremely habitual, and I'm struggling to create new, constructive habits. How do I reengage myself as a grad student? I appreciate any and all tips--even if it's not helpful to me, it might be to someone else.

\---

Okay now the longer version if you want more context:

I'm technically a second-year PhD student in astro, though I largely consider myself a first-year as I am mostly completing first-year courses. Things have been difficult from the get-go. I've struggled to keep up with work, struggled to care about my classes, struggled to care about my research. I got extremely burnt out at the end of undergrad, and would have taken a year off if I had not won the NSF (which you can't defer).

To be honest, I was doing quite well with getting caught up, then this past semester just had one thing after another go wrong and had to take an Incomplete in yet another class and I barely completed *last* years' Incompletes. I used to be very on top of things, and though I am trying not to romanticize my undergrad self (who was very studious but also very lonely) it's hard not to. I don't really trust myself anymore when I say I am going to do something, though I am starting to do this more and more often.

I considered dropping out for awhile, but realized eventually it was burnout/depression-induced apathy. After a lot of soul-searching (and therapy) I discovered I *do* actually want to complete this degree, but I've gotten *really* used to procrastinating. That's the big issue: Regardless of actual motivation and dedication, I am used to quick dopamine hits. My ""vice"" of choice is reading fiction, which probably doesn't sound like such a bad thing but it takes hours out of every day. I'm not trying to stop reading, but I would like to get a handle on how much control it has over my life. **In general, I really want to start this new semester strong, and carry that through. I want to prove to myself that I** ***am*** **capable of getting my PhD.**

1ffd34t,When to Walk Away From First Publication Opportunity,"Currently a second year doctoral student in epidemiology. I was invited to collaborate on a project by one of my university’s instructors. The project topic is something I’m very interested in, and I could work it into my dissertation. I’ve been working on this project for roughly 6 weeks now, with weekly meetings between my school’s instructor and the person with the original concept and data (an adjunct prof from Duke). Now here’s my problem. They handed me a bunch of code and data and asked me to run a simulation based on several previous studies that used the same equations and model. All great and good. My problem is that these two professors seem to have no idea what is going into this system/model (where numbers originated, what equations were used for what, why certain things were done, etc.), and so when I have questions that arise, they can’t answer them. I have walked them through a ridiculous amount of information that originates from the documentation they sent me. My questions are what has dominated every single one of our meetings thus far - I email them a question days before a scheduled meeting, they ignore it until we meet face to face, I walk them through where my question is stemming from and why I’m confused with the next step, and they eventually decide on a solution that could have taken 5 minutes to establish if they had just looked at my question and opened the associated documentation. On top of that, one of these instructors continuously tells me to keep the data “as is” from previous publications of different diseases, rather than putting in the accurate information for the relevant disease we’re looking at. Which is just bad science and gives research a bad name. I’ve had to tell him “no, I won’t do that, it needs to be updated in order to be valid” multiple times. I’m a doctorate student, I have a full time job, a 2.5 year old, and am expecting my second child any day now. This publication would be the first publication I have my name on, which has always been a big goal of mine. But I’m seriously debating walking away from it, because these two men don’t seem to respect my time and energy, have wasted a lot of my time waiting for their input and responses, and I have to continuously tell them I’m not willing to do shawty work for the sake of simplicity and pumping out a publication faster. 

What would it take for you guys to walk away from a publication opportunity? Am I being rash in debating dropping out of the project? Is this how profs treat the students they have assisting on their projects - you (the student) do all the hard and time consuming work and they will get to it when I get to it?

164k9zx,the return of students who flunked,"I need advice! I have 2 students in a class this fall that did not pass in recent semesters. One of them did not pass the class twice - first time they went MIA mid-semester, then came back the following semester and attended for about half the semester but simple did no work. Literally would sit in class and look at their phone instead of trying (it is a workshop class where students have time to work on projects. If I asked why they were not working on the project during class, would say they would do it at home.  This student told me they had family issues and while I understand the challenges they simply did not try. I gave many, many extensions, set them up to work with a friend, had polite meetings, then tried deadlines and firmer deadlines. They handed in exactly zero assignments then eventually stopped coming. The other student was generally good but had freshman-itis and stopped handing in projects as it got towards the end of semester. 

How do you handle students like this? I 100% don't blame them exactly, however when I see repeat issues how do you approach? Ignore and pretend those did not happen (which feels odd especially with the student I had tons of meetings with). Assume the best and wait till they have issues?  They are both respectful but just don't do the work, even when given class time to do it.  

In over 20 years of teaching this is the first time I had students fail then return. Usually if they don't pass they are dropping out of school anyway. Generally my attitude is that I care about student success but I cannot care more than they do. But sitting in class with time to work, then not working, then not having something to hand in - this is not a family issue, its just not applying oneself.

111cwaz,Turning down the NSF fellowship,"I know this might rub some people the wrong way because the NSF fellowship is so sought after and a privilege to win. I had a good application and a lot of experience and I feel like my chances are about 50/50 because it’s so random to win.

Here’s the thing. My dad died in July unexpectedly and traumatically. I don’t think the grief had totally hit me when I decided to apply, or maybe it was that I thought I’d be fine by the time my PhD program started. Well, I’m not doing well. It’s weighing on me heavily and I’m struggling to even begin writing my thesis for my MS. I have no drive or passion for it anymore and honestly would be perfectly happy just dropping out completely. My mom is worse off and I’m trying my best to be there for her. Now her dad (my grandpa) is currently on his deathbed and not expected to survive the day.

To add to this, I found out I was pregnant a couple weeks after applying. I’m due mid July with my first child, which is 1 month before the PhD program would start. The NSF fellowship is pretty strict, I think I can get medical leave for a short amount of time but with postpartum exhaustion I just don’t know if it will be the right move for me, baby, my husband, or our finances due to childcare.

I just don’t think I have it in me to do this. My husband makes good money, and I just want to stay home for a while and find a job I like on my terms, whether it be a few months or a few years. My soul is tired.

If I’m awarded the fellowship I’m going to put so much pressure on myself and feel guilty if I don’t take it. It’s such a big opportunity and will allow me to go to a local ivy leave school in an amazing lab with an amazing advisor. For that reason I hope the choice is taken away from me and I don’t win.

Another thing, I don’t want to let others down. I know when I put my mind to something I’m an extremely good student and researcher. Professors and mentors have acknowledged that, and want to see me succeed almost to the point of pressuring me. They wrote my recommendation letters.

1ga4rh9,8 weeks into a PoliSci master’s and I want to quit,"I graduated undergrad with a Polisci degree back in 2023 and I spent a year at my parents’ place looking for jobs while I passed the time with this remote paid internship. Nothing came of my job search and I was going stir crazy and needed a way to get out of the house (I had no friends in the area so it was just me and my parents there and while they love me and are nice to spend time with in moderation they’re extremely overbearing and helicoptery and refuse to respect my adulthood) so I let my parents talk me into going back to my Alma mater for a master’s.

Things seemed fine at first, although the work was much higher quantity and more tedious than what I’d done undergrad. However, it quickly became clear that the material itself was going to be radically different from undergrad in ways I didn’t care for at all. These courses seem to be much closer to applied science courses with a political backdrop, with most of the assignments consisting of reading 3-4 20-40 page studies a week and critiquing the nitty gritty of their methodology in some way, as well as doing one of the many, many steps to prep for our final papers.

Then, shit from my personal life blew up out of nowhere. When I moved into my off campus apartment that semester, the person who was supposed to be my roommate fucked off and never came back after his old roommate brought in a flea problem, the fleas resurfaced my 2nd week of classes, I was put in a hotel until they could fumigate the place, and a long chain of events involving me being falsely accused of and arrested for a serious crime ensued from there (I live in one of like two states where if a person complains about you to police the complainant can just go before a judge or magistrate and have you arrested and charged without even an investigation first). Being forced to don the orange jumpsuit for a day and having your phone held by police as “evidence” for a week and a half for shit that you didn’t do was, well, traumatizing, and I had to move back in with my parents and attend classes on Zoom for a couple weeks until we figured out what to do. My parents were able to get me a good lawyer and this shit’s pretty close to taken care of now, but it was terrifying at the time and was a constant source of stress my first few weeks.

Just when I thought things were finally starting to settle down, my area gets absolutely bodied by Hurricane Helene and half of town gets flooded. The university shuts down, at first for a week, then two, and that whole time I’m seeing constant horror stories of people losing their homes, so I assume that school is going to eventually decide to close the whole semester. 

Well, turns out they didn’t do that and we’re back after two weeks. Getting back into the flow of things after an unexpected two week break is hard enough, but my internet was wiped out by the storm and STILL hasn’t been fixed so doing work is much harder now and requires leaving my place. I already had to ask a teacher for an extension on something because of this and he was willing to give it, but he made it clear that he was only willing to make it a one time thing. This week, all of my teachers are kind of cramming in the assignments we missed at once. Tomorrow I have a critical reaction to 4 20-40 page readings, a critical review of a 400-page book, and a 10-source (20-40 page each scholarly articles like the readings) source matrix for my final paper all due. Needless to say, I’ve gotten maybe 9 hours of sleep total this week and I just can’t do this shit anymore. I tried all day to sit down in a local coffee shop with internet access to get these things taken care of and just couldn’t motivate myself, constantly distracted myself to take the edge off, and got nothing done. Eventually I just gave up, wrote a long text to my Dad about dropping out, and wrote this. What the hell do I even do at this point?

Barring all of these awful personal coincidences that I’m choosing to interpret as something up there screaming at me that grad school was a shit idea, I’m just making myself miserable for a degree I don’t even rly feel I need because dropping out would piss my parents off, but living with them again would also make me miserable.

1heeogj,Thinking of dropping out in my second to last year. Need advice.,"Hello, Reddit. I'm an architecture student who is now in my 10th semester (12th is the maximum here). I study at a well-reputed university, which gave me a lot of pride at the time, but unfortunately I didn't put much thought into choosing my major. After COVID hit, my mental health took a turn for the worse, I started skipping classes (to get more money on the side) and became content with just getting Cs.

I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder last year, and it goes hand-in-hand with my tendency for perfectionism. Ever since taking up my thesis this semester, I've failed to manage my time to keep studying while also keeping my mental health in check. Abandoned prescribed meds, etc.

I need to pass just 1 course this semester to get my life back on track, but this course has the biggest amount of credits and needs a tremendous amount of consistent work - and I've fallen behind by procrastinating.

I make excuses often, but I'm honest to God exhausted. I don't know what I'm still doing here.

I've unfortunately considered doing the unspeakable plenty times as I feel like I've been nothing but a burden to my divorced mother, who has been working her ass off like crazy to help me pay for my studies. There's no denying the fact that I've made horrible, stupid decisions. And dropping out feels like it could be one of them too.

On the other hand, I wholeheartedly believe I would be 100% happier if I just stopped now and pursued a career in art (Which doesn't need a degree. Not from what I've seen.). As a side note, I also don't have debts to pay as it's not a system in my country.

I *know* I'm talented at art. It gives me true passion unlike any other field, and I know the resources and ways to succeed if I really tried. Of course I would need to work on my mental health first, but I see myself pursuing art regardless even if I were to stay here and graduate.

Any advice? It's D-3 of an important exam, and I'm trying to do the work but I've missed a lot of classes that passing would not even be a guarantee this semester - which would lead to an inevitable dropout. Sorry if this is a mess to read. I would appreciate any input. Harsh reality checks would be amazing too.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1heeogj/thinking_of_dropping_out_in_my_second_to_last/
1hl8xd0,Dropping out but plan on coming back,"So I plan on dropping out for the time being and pursuing something else for a better well paying job.

1fd5q8o,Dropping out,"I'm 22 and have been in college since 2020, so about five years now. I’ve changed my major a bunch of times but finally settled on Computer Information Systems, mostly because I thought it would be useful. I used to live closer to campus, but after my parents moved, I’m now two hours away. The commute is exhausting since I take public transportation, and driving isn’t really an option with the cost of gas, city traffic, tolls, and tuition expenses. Living on campus isn’t realistic either because it’s way too expensive and I get no financial aid. I’ve already contacted the financial aid department about any kind of help and they couldn’t care less.

I don’t feel like I’ve learned much in my classes. I’m passing, but I feel unmotivated and overwhelmed.

1hn2by4,Imposter syndrome and mental games are so real in M3,"I don’t know if this is in vent or well-being or both but I really want to say this to people who will really understand me.

M3 as in many countries is the first clinical year in our system. Since the beginning I have been feeling like an absolute failure, wreck, maybe twice every day I have been thinking of dropping out. I am mentally so bad, I can’t even describe my own emotions. It doesn’t help that we have the good old drama in our group so it makes me even more angry.

It begun last year, when in anatomy and physiology I got Bs while I have the rest in As. I felt really angry as these are basically the most medical subjects and while my fellows have As in those I stand out as failure. I know B is not a bad mark, but still. Then in the summer I went for a volunteer work as a nurse in my local hospital and there I received so many compliments about my thinking and skills that I kinda brushed it off by saying that the knowledge matters not the marks.

Now the beginning of this year, I feel absolute wreck - I feel like I forgot all the anatomy, the physiology is 50/50, we begin the innumerable subjects, I feel like I don’t know anything in each. I start studying in 2-3 of them because the professors there are more strict. Then I start trying to catch up on those that I missed. I start stressing because I think I do good but now I look at my colleagues and they answer some questions that I find absolutely hard as common sense. I am starting to wonder if I actually deserve to be studying medicine with all those lacking fields. I start crying, being irritable, not being able to look at myself, the situation is awful. This takes all my energy, even when I sit down to study, I feel like I will fail as I will forget it. I look at my peers from other universities who are harsh on them in every subject and I see how they can juggle everything while I can’t manage the 2-3 that I am in need right not to understand. 

It doesn’t end there - some of my peers just love judging you by your university. Mine is a small and relatively new one so everyone sees us as the people who got in just because they weren’t accepted in other “better” universities. This crushes my mentality as I really adore my university as all of the professors, though harsh, always work for us, care for us, they literally see us as their children. Sometimes I would be asked things by those people and I wouldn’t answer they would say “That’s because you don’t study in [my uni name]”. Like bro, I am already with a mental luggage, spare me this at least. 

I know that I have responsibility as well, for example for ignoring some subjects because of some other subject, but at the end of the day I try to survive and it has become something day for day. Can I just have a day of not feeling guilty or like the biggest fool of the medical school history even? Can I just be thankful that I survived the day and pat myself on the back because I passed this particular exam? Or do I have to be constantly concerned that I don’t lnow this, that, third… a big pile of things? How do you deal with that? How do you keep your mind fresh? I feel like anxiety has made me become what I am now. I wasn’t like this, I was still stressed, yes, but not so that I saw myself as a huge failure. I knew that I had kinda fragile self but that much? What is wrong with me? I used to be a girl with big dreams like “I will win Nobel prize” big dreams. Yes, that’s kinda silly but still I would be very confident in myself, and now I am scared to even answer the most obvious questions. Is this some sort of social experiment? Did I have my head too much in the clouds and now I receive my reality check?",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1hn2by4/imposter_syndrome_and_mental_games_are_so_real_in/
1fukd7i,Afraid of telling my family I want to drop out of college.  ,"This is my first year of college and I absolutely feel as if dropping out would be the best option for me. Under immense pressure, and the standards of my family I gave it a shot and ultimately decided it’s not for me despite what my family may think of it. I recently stopped wanting to go after a couple instances of being put into a group and doing assignments but receiving little to no response from my group. I told my professor about this, and with little to no response. I’m a sensitive person I’ll admit but this genuinely hurt my feelings but I also feel as if I have to understand cause this isn’t high school anymore. 

My plan for school was to take a gap year, and work for that year. But the pressure from family to move out, while not having a job has plummeted me into a serve depression. I don’t have any friends or resources to get back and forth from work without a complaint or lecture. I’m 18, I can’t drive, I can’t really form meaningful relationships outside of my boyfriend and it’s affecting me. I feel so far behind seeing everybody else excel and exceed.

1go2s0i,UK English Literature Funding Advice,"Hi all,

  
In 2023 I began a PhD studying the poetry of William Blake, however I had to drop out as I did not secure funding for it, and the cost of living was simply too high. Every day this eats away at me, as obtaining a PhD is my dream -- so dropping out was about as hard as you can imagine.

  
I'm looking to start another PhD, but this time, with funding. I was wondering if anyone has any advice about obtaining funding for a UK PhD in English Literature. I'm aware of the White Rose fund for Yorkshire based universities, but I'm open to studying anywhere through distance learning. 

  
Since dropping my PhD (hopefully, temporarily), I started my training to teach in a secondary school, which is what I'm currently doing. If I was to obtain funding, I have no problem with putting my teaching on hold to pursue it, but if not, I'm more than happy to study my PhD part time while I work. If anyone has any experience or advice with this, that would be great to hear too. 

  
Thanks a lot!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1go2s0i/uk_english_literature_funding_advice/
1cye00m,Hating my study species,"I am 1 year in and halfway done a MSc in wildlife biology. I study wild deer mice and the effects of climate change on their population. The project came to be because my professor accumulated the data from an undergrad course's trapping project, not because there was actually any interest in the subject. Deer mice are native here, but are generally considered a pest. 

I love research, I am on track to graduate on time, but I hate my project and I'm terrified of being thought of as a mouse expert. I have depressive episodes lasting days to weeks whenever I am introduced as the Mouse Person, or asked questions about my project.

I thought I would grow to like my species, and it felt like my ""in"" into the field of wildlife, as I was previously in medicine, so I took the first project I found. I hate mice. I hate the field work, I barely get any exercise because my study site is small and I spend so little time in the field. I feel so jealous of my lab mates studying species that I want to be an expert in, or working on applied conservation projects that actually have parties invested in their results.

Can anyone give me stories of getting a fulfilling job after completing a graduate degree in a subject they hate? I'm just trying to see the light instead of my hate for my subject. I don't plan on dropping out, I just want to know that there's something better out there. I've already been offered more interesting MSc projects, but I would be burning bridges that I'd like to keep open if I quit.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1cye00m/hating_my_study_species/

3 years into uni and working at the same time I’ve built a reputation in the banking and tech industry in my city. This is my 3rd job and I’ve been promoted as a team lead of the Data Science Unit. To be fair, I’ve gained all of my knowledge in the field through mentors, personal projects and work expirience.

1gaou5n,College Algebra and Other Mid-Life Crises. ,"I'm 44, taking online courses TRYING to FINALLY finish my degree I started well before most of you were even born, haha (2002, see I wasn't kidding).  The last time I passed an Algebra class was my freshman year in high school in 1994, and I got a D, and that's only because a girl in my class felt bad for me and gave me the answers to most of my homework.

I was enrolled in Elementary Algebra last semester, and had to drop after the first three weeks because I had a 43%.  Like I knew NOTHING, to include the non-algebra review section.  I need a total of 15 hours to graduate, but 3 hours of those are college algebra, and to even be able to take the course, I would have to pass Elementary and Intermediate Algebra, neither of which I think I can do.  I'm not being negative, I'm just being honest.

Current situation - I have a good job, and while it's blue collar, I still make north (barely) of $100k /yr.  We did our yearly reviews with my supervisor the other day, and I told him I was still interested in a supervisor position if one came open, and I was told, ""Well, we really need your expertise in the warehouse.""  For those of you who may not have been around the block as many times as I have, that's corporate-speak for, ""you're too good at your job and you're not going anywhere.""  This was really the main reason I was trying to finish my Bachelors.

TL;DR - I have a good paying job that I really don't mind, and I have no foreseeable path forward to passing any type of Algebra class, let alone college algebra.

My options at this point are:

1-Dropping out.  No harm, no foul, right?

2 -TRYING to finish, but probably realistically taking 12-15(minimum) hrs of unnecessary, unneeded, and very stressful math courses.  I'm assuming this, because I'll probably either fail or drop a couple.

Thanks in advance.

PS- the University offers a non-algebra math class that meets the requirements for college algebra, but passing college algebra is a requirement for taking the class.  Not kidding.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1gaou5n/college_algebra_and_other_midlife_crises/

1ci0rve,Perspectives on the Slippery Rock University Online M.A. in History,"I just wanted to see if anyone has any perspectives on attending the online MA in History at Slippery Rock University, either as current students/alumni or as someone who has a general idea on how reputable the program is. I am not considering it because I need to get into the upper echelons of the field or as a precursor to a PhD. I specifically work in higher ed and previously pursued a Masters of Library and Information Science degree (MLIS) before dropping out for mental health reasons that I have mostly gotten a handle on. 

Rather, I want to go into a History program at the graduate level because I know that it will keep my attention span, I'm good at crafting a narrative and memorizing the historical record of any topic I might encounter in the discipline (which I realized from minoring it in undergrad), and I will legitimately enjoy delving into my coursework. 

By the time I get the degree, my hope is that I will be able to adjunct one evening a week in a U.S. history survey as a second job, use the critical thinking/making connections piece of the degree as transferable skills in my main career field, and maybe have enough of a background at the graduate level where I will be able to feel confident enough to start more of a directly relevant industry-related program after finishing the History one--my ideal long-term would be to have a Masters of History for the passion of it and a Masters or grad cert related to Higher Ed for career advancement. I will be financially comfortable enough to pursue History and would get tuition reimbursement from my company down the line for Higher Ed if I opt to go into a program like that later.

The reason I am heavily leaning towards Slippery Rock is that I was a PASSHE alum as well as my sister (Kutztown and Millersville respectively) and I always found that both of us were treated very compassionately. We were given the rigorous intellectual engagement we needed without being left behind. I tried the University of Alabama when I was in Library Science and it is a great institution, but it made me nostalgic for History and the experience I had in the state system.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ci0rve/perspectives_on_the_slippery_rock_university/

I mentioned via email possibly joining via zoom some days if I'm not physically able to attend but I'd be open to brainstorming ideas.

What I'm really confused about is that he called back the next day and said that the director had experience with my condition and thought it best that i wait a year to start the course so that I could give my spot to someone else before it was too late. He followed up with saying that he wasn't trying to make me feel unwanted in the course but he thinks it might be for the best to assess how much I actually want to be in class and get back to him. What confuses me is that there was no mention of ANY possible accommodations, i feel really brushed aside, like they decided it was far too much effort to accommodate me so they decided to advise me to drop out of the course before it even started.

1jjkvb7,My mom is happy I SOAPed,"
I received the worst news of my professional life and my mom is celebrating. 

I applied psych from a T30 MD school with no red flags and SOAPed into an IM prelim year. My mom is a typical Asian tiger mom crossed with crazy catholic mom (Catholic guilt and Asian perfectionism are a hell of a combination) and she doesn’t believe that mental illness is real. Ever since I expressed my interest in psychiatry during clerkship year, she has opposed it. “You can be anything but please not a psychiatrist”. She told me that if I wasn’t applying psych she would have “invited everyone she knew” to my graduation, but since I applied psych she’s not proud enough to invite anyone. She’s wanted me to be a doctor (an expectation, not an opinion) ever since I could remember and yet now that I’m finally becoming one, she can’t even be proud unless it’s HER idea of a doctor. 

Now that I’ve SOAPed she’s taking this opportunity to reiterate her disapproval of my goals. I’m already feeling the worst invalidation and imposter syndrome I’ve ever experienced, and her smug insistence that this is proof that i’m not meant to be a psychiatrist is the cherry on top. I’m still committed to becoming a psychiatrist and reapplying next year but I’m so tired of this “family support”.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjkvb7
1lcl2y8,Words of advice for those starting or thinking about earning a PhD.,"Hey folks. I see a lot of questions about earning PhDs, poorly informed assumptions, and so on. It's early summer and the Fall session will start in a few months. I thought I would offer a perspective of someone who finished their PhD and had their own struggles. Here are 10 things to consider as you start this journey:

1. Treat your PhD as a salaried job and accept that you have the worst salary ever. It sucks. Everything else follows this. If you think you're going to have some glorious side hustle, you're probably wrong. If you think you can work full time and finish a PhD, you'll have challenges doing this. It's a commitment. You need to be in the lab, in the field, running experiments, etc.  You need to get your life sorted out before embarking on this journey.
2. Your PI is not your friend. They are your supervisor first and foremost. They are not there to babysit you. They are going to give you feedback and you may not like it. It might hurt your feelings, make you feel insecure, give you imposter syndrome, and whatever else. It doesn't mean you're stupid. You need to develop strategies to deal with this. You need to have some sort of a support group.
3. Your PI's behavior is influenced by what made them successful. Unfortunately, this can include them being assholes to people, including you. They're probably in tenured positions, experts in their fields, and so on. It's not that they're untouchable, but they are hard to replace due to their expertise. You need to figure out how to work in their orbits. This isn't the same as dealing with misconduct. That's not acceptable and should be dealt with accordingly.
4. Know that your PI and faculty are investing in you and they do care. You're taking space and scarce resources in their programs and labs. They chose you and want you to succeed. The lack of your success reflects badly on them and the programs.
5. Do not fuck your lab mates, literally or figuratively. You are not on Grey's Anatomy. These are people you need to work with, need to rely on, and that you're stuck with for multiple years. Drama is fucking annoying.
6. Your labmates are looking out for their own success before your success. Your investments in them may or may not be reciprocated. It's a job at the end of the day for them too. This isn't to say that you won't make friends in your lab. On the contrary, you'll make friends for life unless you're the asshole.
7. If you think you need daily supervision, perhaps a PhD isn't for you yet. Your independence is expected in a PhD program. This isn't the same as mentorship and receiving guidance though. That's to be expected.
8. You're going to have low moments and at some point,  it may break you. Some of these moments include prepping and finishing your qualification exams (or equivalent), proposals and defenses, department presentations, journal submissions and the utter joys of peer review, some fuckup with data collection, figuring out what is your unique contribution to your field, some class you're taking, an undergrad in the class you're TA'ing that's being a pain in your ass, etc. You need to have a support system and be able to channel your stress, anxiety, and whatever else productively. Figure this out early in your program.
9. Your success depends on one or a combination of these: Hard work, working smarter, or having a professional network that you can leverage. Figure out which one you are. Figure out who/what compliments you.
10. Your time spent in your program will strain your existing relationships. You're around a bunch of very smart people for long periods of time. You'll see these people probably more so than your spouse, partner, etc. In stressful situations, people bond over the stress. If you are married, in a long-term relationship, etc., the chance of those persisting through grad school and surviving isn't very high. It'll take effort to maintain these. Most people I knew that were in relationships finished their programs being single or with someone they met in their program.

1cvy8yr,It actually happened—airplane “medical emergency” 2 weeks after graduating,"I want to hear your stories of stepping forward as a doctor out in the real world before you actually feel like a doctor!

So here is my story of how the first time in my life that I said “I am a doctor” was to a flight attendant who asked me to go back to my seat because they need a doctor. 😂
_______

As a freshly-minted doctor, only two weeks after graduating, and traveling via airplane, of course I had the thought ”wait. I’m a doctor now, what if they ask for a doctor on this flight? Can I really even call myself a doctor?”

Anyway, so I graduated medical school 2 weeks ago and am traveling before starting residency. I’m on a late night flight when suddenly the lights pop on and overhead they say there’s a medical emergency and ask any medical personal come forth. In my head I’m like “no way, I actually mentally prepared for this event” so I did my mental 30 second wait and watch for an “adult doctor” to come forth. I saw two people come forth to my relief, but then overhead they asked for an MD or DO to come forward. So I reluctantly stand up and walk forward to assess the situation. Turns out it’s just me and two nurses on the flight. 

I stand by and observe a confused and slightly agitated lady trying to get out of her seat being held down by the flight attendant and nurse. Right on cue someone in the back say she needs water and the nurse and flight attendant frantically get her a bottle of water and proceed to accidentally pour it on her face and right down her chest 😂

Still a little skeptical that I am the only doctor onboard, i have to ask 3 or 4 times what happened before the flight attendant finally said she had a seizure. 

At this moment the lead flight attendant embraces my imposter syndrome and asks me to sit down because they need a doctor. So for the first time in my life, I say that “I am a doctor… graduated 2 weeks ago” 

Feeling a little relieved that this was the best case scenario as far as “emergencies” go, I speak up a little more confidently asking her name and where she is right now. She says her name and that she is on a plane. So I know she is mostly over the post-ictal period. I ask her if she takes any medications to stop seizures which she says she does. So I have her take another dose of her anti-seizure medication then go back to my seat for the rest of the flight. 

Best part was at baggage claim the cool skater dude that up in first class fist bumps me and says “good job back there doc!”

*TL;DR*
2 weeks after graduation, had to call myself a doctor for the first time on an airplane after being told to sit down because there’s a medical emergency. Told a lady to take her antiepileptic med, and got a first bump from skater dude.

I just started a PhD. For the past 3 months I feel I was below expectations.

During the interview, I was told I was brilliant and fast thinking - which I am definitely not, but I prepared very well for the interviews.

During the first 3 months, there were 4 occasions that I needed extensions because I did not finish the writing in time.

Furthermore, I have been saying a lot of stupid things in front of my supervisors (this was mainly due to feeling anxious because they are very good supervisors, probably more than I deserve.

On feedback, I received concepts regarding the conceptual incoherence on some of the statements on the paper. 

I understand there is an imposter syndrome aspect to some extent. But I believe this is combined with lower ability than is expected of me. Especially, given my intellectual ability is just average (I think I have a 105 IQ or smth, and average grades at school). It's annoying to be average when everyone around me is so so good at what they do.

15ndv2z,From Code to Desolation: How Majoring in Computer Science Left Me With Nothing But Regret,"Hey fellow CS majors,

I've been wanting to share my story for a while now, hoping that it might resonate with some of you who are struggling or on the fence about majoring in computer science. Let me tell you, my journey through this major has been an emotional roller coaster that has left me with nothing but regret.

First off, let me clarify that I was truly passionate about technology and coding when I started. I had this grand vision of becoming a software engineer, working on cutting-edge projects, and changing the world. The promise of high-paying jobs and endless opportunities drew me in like a moth to a flame. But little did I know that reality would hit me like a ton of bricks.

The workload, oh my god, the workload. I thought I was prepared for it, but nothing could have prepared me for the endless nights of debugging, the constant stress of meeting deadlines, and the feeling of inadequacy that seemed to hang over me like a dark cloud. It seemed like every week brought a new programming language to learn, a new framework to master, and a new project that felt impossible to complete.

And the competition – don't even get me started on that. It felt like I was constantly surrounded by geniuses who had been coding since they were in diapers. Every time I entered a coding competition or attended a hackathon, I was reminded of how far behind I was. The imposter syndrome hit me harder than a freight train, and I began to doubt my own abilities.

But the worst part? The job market. You would think that with a CS degree, job offers would be pouring in, right? Wrong. The oversaturation of the market meant that even entry-level positions required years of experience. It was a catch-22 – I needed a job to gain experience, but I needed experience to get a job. The rejection emails piled up, each one a reminder of how little I had to show for my years of hard work and sacrifice.

And let's talk about mental health. The constant pressure to perform, the isolation of spending hours in front of a screen, and the feeling that you're always one step away from failure – it took a toll on my mental well-being. Depression and anxiety became my unwanted companions, and seeking help felt like admitting defeat in a field that prides itself on being all-knowing and confident.

So, here I am now, feeling like I've been chewed up and spat out by the CS major machine. The promises of a bright future seem like a distant dream, and all I have to show for it is a piece of paper that feels more like a cruel joke. My passion has turned into resentment, my confidence shattered, and my hope for a better life crushed.

I know this might come across as a sob story, but I genuinely want to caution those of you who are considering majoring in computer science. It's not all rainbows and unicorns – there are tears, sleepless nights, and moments of deep regret. I wish someone had told me the harsh truth before I embarked on this journey.

If you're thriving in your CS major, I genuinely applaud you. But if you're struggling like I did, just know that you're not alone. It's okay to question your path, to seek help when you need it, and to explore other options if this isn't the right fit for you. Don't let the allure of success blind you to the very real challenges that come with majoring in computer science.

Stay strong, my fellow CS majors. And remember, your worth isn't defined by a degree or a job title.",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/15ndv2z/from_code_to_desolation_how_majoring_in_computer/

The presenting is whatever, but the networking is my absolute Achilles heel. I just can't do it. Usually somewhere along the second day my anxiety gets so bad that I have to go back to my hotel room and have a quick panic attack. I sometimes just go to the toilet to be alone for a bit without standing by myself awkwardly or risking running into people I know who I then need to talk to until the next session. I usually don't have very bad imposter syndrome and am pretty confident in my competences, but then a conference rolls around and I don't feel like a human capable of social interactions anymore.

1kqtvu9,Are Your Students Smarter than You?,"In the past few months, I have noticed a particular type of comment pop up here more often than I expected; a poster here states that they believe some of their student are smarter than they are. I first noticed it a little over two months ago when a professor claimed she thought many (she may have said ""most"") were smarter than her; these were undergraduate students. Something about that struck me, but it seems like every couple weeks, that same sentiment has shown up in a comment. Clearly, a few who post here regularly feel like some students are smarter than them.

Is this a common feeling for some of you?  I know we, as Ph.D.s, represent about 2% of the population. In a class of 50, we might find one student to go on to a doctorate. I suspect if you only mentor grad students, that feeling might be more common, but the comments I've seen have been about undergrads. Some of our undergrads are great and very talented, but I've always abided by the premise that the professor is an expert. I know imposter syndrome is rampant here; is that an indicator of this feeling?

I look at my background for why I am surprised; I was that nerd growing up (before nerds were cool) who was just expected to achieve. Teachers loved me. I loved learning about everything, and most subjects came easy to me. I kind of assumed most of my professors had similar nerdtastic backgrounds, though experience taught me there are many paths (and perseverance is a critical trait to finish a Ph.D.). I've met bad and even incompetent professors, but I tend to presume that the professor in the room is the expert, so seeing this sentiment several times makes me curious.

Lowkey excited to start working as a big boy now, but also biggest fear (besides imposter syndrome, making clinical errors, not having time to play Pokémon, follow kpop bla bla) is how tf do I stay looking cute during internship? During placements in med school, I always got compliments from doctors, nurses, patients etc on my outfits, skin etc (sadly no compliments on clinical skills), but I was horrified to see that most of y'all's fits dont pass the vibe check. I might have taken an L on my studies but want to atleast maintain my appearance in same level as med school. 

Anyways, with internship starting soon, how do I have time to not look crusty? Chile I too booked and busy to do clinical audit/publication, so I finna  contribute meaningfully to the hospital culture through my cute fits and glazed doughnut visual, so hoping that scores me some CV points for surgical training (jks I actually like myself, so won't do surg)

Do I have to wear scrubs every day as a lowlife intern? Will I really not have any time to do my 7 step K-beauty skincare routine? Can I still wear cute loafers and not the corporate slave RM Williams without the consultant side-eyeing me? All these worries are fr causing my psoriasis to flare up like no cap.

161x1nr,advisor for the major i want to enter told me that i could not academically succeed in the major… how to move on and disregard her message?? (tldr at the end),"hi everyone! i am entering my junior year and i want to enter the physiology major at my school. at my college, it is the hardest life science and it is known that a lot of people enter the major because they are premed and then change their major because it is so hard. i have wanted to enter this major for so long because all the other life science majors don’t speak to me/interest me. i have talked to upperclassmen in this major and have done extensive research into the classes in the major since freshman year.

at the end of the spring ‘23 term, i still needed one last requirement and the only time to take it was the summer semester. because i would not get financial aid, i had to pay out of pocket and i didn’t have the money and my parents refused to help. i decided to schedule a meeting with the advisor of the physiology major to see if i could take my last prereq and the first intro class of the major at the same time due to my circumstances. 

at the meeting, the physiology advisor decided to pull up my grades in intro chem 1/2 and organic chemistry 1/2 (which were all C+) and straight up told me that she did not think that i could academically succeed in physiology just based on my grades in chemistry. she even told me that the major that i am in right now (general bio) is too hard for me and that i should switch to marine biology or psychology. keep in mind, i never asked if she thought i could succeed or not and she didn’t even answer my original question.

i actually ended up breaking down in front of her and started sobbing because of how bad it hurt my feelings, especially since during my first two years i was really depressed and had no motivation, so for my advisor to judge me based on those grades and disregard me really hurt my feelings. it also fueled my imposter syndrome because i go to a t20 as a black student and i am from a really low income part of the Bay Area. i also ended up going to therapy sessions for a while because of how bad it hurt me and my therapist even told me that what she said was really hurtful and unwarranted. for another opinion, i ended up reaching back to a teacher from my freshman year who majored in physiology at my school and they said that what the advisor said was really untrue and hurtful. this teacher also told me that the physiology major isn’t really based on intro chem and ochem, only biochem. so if i really grind and do well in biochem, i will be fine. this teacher also said that unless the advisor has statistics that proves that all people with a c in chemistry fail in the major, then it wasn’t her place to say that to me.

over the few weeks after this, i talked to different majors in life sciences at my school and nothing really spoke to me either. i decided that i would continue pursuing physiology because life is too short to let random people discourage me. i told my parents about what happened and my depression and they decided to scrape together some cash for me to take the last prerequisite at a school in my area and ultimately I passed the class. 

now the problem is that in order to enter my major, i need to fill out these documents and all of them require a signature from her and on top of that the first class in the major is full so in order to get into the class i need to get a specific code from her. i am really scared to interact with her in person because what she said genuinely keeps me up at night. as much as i mentally tell myself that i am a great student at deserve to be here at my school, i am scared of failing and not doing as well as i promised myself I could. 

i am hoping to get some advice from students who have gone through this. i haven’t talked about this with anyone except for my older sister, my parents, my therapist, and my freshman year teacher. thanks for reading!

tldr: advisor for the major i want to enter told me that i couldn’t succeed in the major and that i should look for something easier. after months of therapy, crying at night, and day dreaming in summer school, I decided that i would disregard what she said hoping that i would not have to interact with her for my last two years in college, but it turns out that she needs to approve my major change documents and give me a code to enter the intro class because it is full",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/161x1nr/advisor_for_the_major_i_want_to_enter_told_me/

qxkyk5,Feeling on top of the world,"I was a very average (3rd quartile) preclinical student. So far on my rotations, I’ve been average, which I kind of expected. I’m currently on my last day of IM ICU rotation. The attending just pulled me aside (I was terrified that he was about to reprimand me for doing UWorld at table rounds or something) and told me that I am possibly the best medical student he’d ever had. I am floored. I thought that at most, I was (for once) doing better than average. I felt like I vibed with the attending and the residents had told me I was doing a good job, but I thought they were just really nice.

1g4prpi,I feel like people should stop idealizing college as *the* best years of your life.,"Maybe it is for some. Maybe it's the best years of your life because college is, for you, like being a spot of pollen introduced to a rich and tightly-woven network of bees and having the chance to become a meaningful part of that hive.

But is that really it? Do the ""best years of your life"" end there? If anything it's doing more harm than good. Setting higher-than-necessary standards, and really seeding the imposter syndrome because it gets students feeling like their entire life's worth is determined by the handful of years that really is just the prologue to learning how to adult.

When my parents passed the gaokao and went to university, the only fees they had to pay was for the bedding in their dorms. All they had to do was pass their classes and they were guaranteed, at the minimum, a government job when they graduated. My dad then took his masters in Canada and now he thinks he can dictate and judge my college life based off his experience from like forty years ago. Of course YOUR uni years were your best, you could buy a house back then with a good handshake LOL.

It makes me irrationally angry. People yapping about ""Things should be this, they should be that. You should be this by this time, you should be that by that time."" The post-secondary experience isn't one size fits all.

For me, this degree means I get a fighting chance for the possibility of seeing the best years of my life. It means being able to leave this wretched household and finally being able to see where this newly-patched will to live can take me.

I'm finally beginning to get my life back together, get involved in school and make friends. If college is supposed to be the best years of my life, what's the point of all of this effort if it means I'm only going to head back downhill once I graduate? College is a building block toward a future, but I refuse to believe it's the defining piece. There has to be something more.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1g4prpi/i_feel_like_people_should_stop_idealizing_college/
lrazsk,Confessions: The antidote to imposter syndrome?,"In a [recent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/lqm4a3/do_you_actually_read_all_the_literature_youre/) about not fully reading every paper, a lot of people expressed relief at finding out they're not the only person who does that.

I wonder how many of the other parts of imposter syndrome could melt away if we just talked about them like this.

I'll get us started:

> My sleep schedule varies widely and I sometimes do not get up until after 1 PM. I also sometimes multitask in meetings and seminars (especially if there’s a PowerPoint presentation involved), forget about paperwork until after it is due, and sometimes if I’m talking to someone and I mention a paper I read a while ago I’m vague or I misremember details and get them wrong.
>
> I also procrastinate, don’t know how to network, don’t keep my LinkedIn updated, am not part of academic Twitter, am slow about checking and answering my email, and am afraid of admitting that I don’t know something and asking for help because I think everyone else must already know it and I’m ashamed to admit that I don’t.

OK, I've shown you mine... your turn! (Please?)

1j79vxe,TT offer!,"I heard back from a place that I interviewed at, and I now have an unofficial offer for a TT asst prof position!!!! I'm currently in the negotiation phase with salary and start-up funding, and trying to put together a budget document (a better version of what I had previously prepared). 
I'm so fucking ecstatic about this offer, and also very nervous because shit's about to get very very real and I just hope I can survive with my head above water. 

After a few grueling months of rejections and no job prospects, and with a visa that's expiring in a couple of months, I couldn't have asked for better timing on this news. I really needed something to go my way, and it's finally happened!

Still fighting back tons of imposter syndrome, wondering why the fuck they gave me this job, but years of therapy has slowly seeped in, and I'm finally beginning to accept a little bit that maybe, just maybe I kind of deserve this. 

Fuck. Yessssssss.

When I interviewed here, this place was R2, and in the last month or so they've been labeled as R1, and I have no idea what that means for me, and if any of the stuff they told me during my interview process really changes substantially, like output expectations. Any advice about negotiation and navigating this whole thing is highly appreciated!

189cvjy,"[AMA] I'm Mark Benliyan and I wrote my first line of code as a freshman in October 2021 . Since then I did 6 software engineering internships at companies like Figma/Netflix & graduated in 2 years. Happy to answer questions about my journey, replicating these results, or any other career advice!","Hey everyone! I'm stoked to be doing an AMA on here and appreciate the mods support with making this happen.

My name is Mark Benliyan and I started my CS journey at UCLA roughly 2 years ago. I grew up in an immigrant household knowing nothing about coding, the tech industry, or software engineering careers. I entered UCLA as a Psychology major planning to pursue Big Law, then switched to Business Econ to pursue Investment Banking. I learned about CS and the tech industry while at UCLA which pushed me to switch my major once again to Computer Science and Linguistics with dreams of becoming a software engineer.

Since then things have turned out far better than I could've ever anticipated. To help drive this AMA, I'll  include a list of all my previous experiences, chronologically, that I think could be of interest. Please note that I'm not doing this to boast in any way, I can still vividly remember having imposter syndrome myself and being unsure if I ""have what it takes"" to be an engineer.

Here is that list:

* SWE Contractor at Clever (Saved Passwords)
* SWE Intern at Tinder (Backend Recommendations)
* Flown out to San Francisco by Salesforce for Tech Equality Summit
* SWE Intern at NASA JPL (Internal Tools)
* SWE Intern at BitGo (Developer Relations)
* Got offers from Figma, Netflix, Amazon, Gusto Microsoft, Atlassian, and Slack. Also went through processes with Google, Dropbox, Lyft, LinkedIn, Two Sigma, SpaceX, Palantir, and a few others during the recruiting season (dropped out of most, failed Lyft and SpaceX, didn't get Google team match)
* Flown out to New York by Jane Street for FOCUS program
* SWE Intern at Figma (FigJam Core)
* Flown out to New York by D.E. Shaw for Nexus Fellowship
* Participated in Palantir's Launch Program (remote)
* Participated in Two Sigma's Seekers Summit (remote)
* Flown out to Massachusetts by Harvard Business School for Summer Venture in Management program
* Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellowship (2023)
* Neo Scholars program (ended up as a finalist)
* Graduated 2 years early in June 2023
* SWE intern at Netflix (Productivity Engineering)
* Just returned to Figma as a New Grad

I've spent a ton of time helping thousands of students and new grads land their dream software engineering roles. Some of you may recognize me from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbenliyan/) where I've been posting 2-3 New Grad / Internship roles every day. I also have [a YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClY-zGNyP9RZvX4ZZC5_nIQ) where I share everything I've learned along the way to help other students on their journey. I'm making this post today to give everyone a chance to see this and start asking their questions. **I'll be answering them tomorrow, December 3rd, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (PST)**. Let's do this!!

***Edit (10:15 AM):*** Good morning! I just finished reading through most of the comments. I certainly didn't expect this to be so polarizing but I welcome the criticism and don't blame those skeptical of me. I'll be editing this main post with responses to common questions/criticisms that I see as I start working through the AMA.

There's been a lot of debate surrounding the authenticity of my background. Everything I've shared in the post above is true. The list above, as well as my story into tech, is merely a compilation of facts. I don't expect folks to accept this at face value, especially on Reddit, so **I've compiled a google drive with redacted evidence for everything I shared in the list above, as well as my tenure at UCLA. You can access that below.**

***Edit (11:58 AM):*** Hey y'all, since the morning my replies to questions are currently requiring manual mod approval due to insufficient karma. This slows down how quickly things are appearing. Reached out the mods to see what we can do.

***Edit (12:26 PM):***

***my comment replies are still not showing up for viewers pending this mod-review process. only edits to my main post appear, but I'm assuming mods will approve at some point soon.***

There's been lots of questions relating to overlapping timelines, so here's a breakdown of what the timeline looked like!

*note: UCLA works on a quarter system, not a semester system*

*note-2: I entered UCLA with 61.5 school credits, a mix of AP classes and 3 college courses I took the summer before starting university. UCLA requires 180 units to graduate.* [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]

* December 2021: Joined Clever as a swe contractor for a year-long contract where I would work 5-10 hours / week asynchronously. The async nature of this with the low weekly commitment left me time to do internships as well (which they knew about).
* Summer 2022: Joined Tinder for the internship and did 4 Summer Classes [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. During this time is when I attended the Salesforce Tech Equality summit using PTO from Tinder, which they knew about.
* Fall 2022: In Fall I signed offers for both NASA (year-long, part-time role for students) and BitGo. I negotiated BitGo to only work Tues-Friday so I have Mondays off. I negotiated NASA to only come into the Lab on Mondays. Mondays I went to NASA, Tues-Friday I worked at BitGo, and I took [3 classes [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. My school gave me a couple credits for interning as well.
* Winter 2023: I was done with BitGo and Clever by now, and NASA was still ongoing as a year-long role. I quit NASA, went to Jane Street's FOCUS program, then moved to San Francisco to join Figma, since Figma was the company I was most excited about working at. During this time I learned that if I take 4 classes winter quarter, I can graduate in June 2023 - so that's what I did [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. Most classes allowed me to work remotely, but I took a total of 5 or 6  round-trips from SF to LA and back for Midterms and Finals. I wasn't optimizing for GPA or grades anymore. I also had a few days off at Figma, and near the end of March is when I attended the D.E. Shaw Nexus Fellowship
* Spring 2023: I finished Figma by now and focused entirely on finishing all requirements to graduate. A bit before finals week, I joined Netflix for the internship I had already signed. Netflix knew that I had graduated early, didn't care. I also had the Palantir and Two sigma virtual events during this time.
* Summer 2023: I graduated, went to Harvard's SVMP (Netflix manager approved my trip). This is when I also participated in the Kleiner Perkins Fellowship and the Neo Scholar program. I received full-time return offers from both Figma and Netflix.

***Edit (2:33 PM):***

Apparently there was a user leaving inappropriate and or offensive comments on this post. Some of you are suggesting this was my ""alter ego"" and my ""alt account."" I'd like to make it clear that I did not create any alt account or influence a single comment from any other account on this subreddit. I'm not sure what the comments from that user said, but they were already deleted this morning when I logged on. Kinda crazy that I need to even clarify this lol

behfte,"Today, my fellow (PGY6) made me cry... [Well-being]","I have the tendency to get long-winded, but I'll try to keep this brief... I am currently on a Peds ID rotation. The fellow that I am working with has a reputation for being tough on students. I was determined not to let this change my expectations going into the rotation. 

Backstory: Throughout the entirety of medical school, I have been well below average. My preclinical class rank was bottom 10, my step score was unremarkable, and I killed a simulated patient on an OSCE during a prior clerkship leading to me tanking the clerkship (long, painful story). So needless to say, heading into this pediatrics clerkship, I was not very confident in my abilities.

My first patient on my peds ID rotation is a pyomyositis. I run through my presentation to the team and get hit with the standard pimp questions (staph aureus, staph aureus, staph aureus). My fellow digs in a little bit and hits me with some tougher pimp questions; somehow, by a twist of fate, I know the answers to these questions. The day goes on with your typical win-some-lose-some.

Day two of the rotation, I was asked to present on a neonatal HSV patient, but due to mandatory rotation lectures (yay), I didn't even get to see this patient. So I had to go off of my memory of the chart and my limited knowledge of neonatal HSV. So at this point, I know I am tanking, especially in front of a tough fellow.

Day three of the rotation (today), no new patients, so just your typical follow-up. Towards the end of the day, I nervously ask the fellow for feedback. She looks at me, takes a deep breath, says ""well,"" pauses, and then proceeds to tell me that I have blown her away with my knowledge base and organization style during patient presentations and succinct assessments/plans on my notes. She tells me that I should be incredibly proud and called me the smartest medical student that she's ever worked with.

Now, again, to reiterate... I am an idiot... I have been consistently at the bottom throughout the entirety of medical school. And any praise that I've gotten from attendings has always been focused on my personality and patient rapport. But hearing this fellow refer to me as intelligent - which was the first time I've heard that throughout all of medical school - brought tears to my eyes. I weakly said thank you, quickly dismissed myself to the bathroom, and cried my eyes out. Now it's likely a rare sight to see a big black guy bawling like a baby... but today was the day.

I share my experience with you because I know that I am not the only student out there who has been fighting off imposter syndrome since day zero. I know that I am not the only student who has STRUGGLED and FAILED to stay within one standard deviation of the mean on tests. I know that I am not the only student who thinks (s)he is an idiot. I know that I am not the only student who has wondered out loud if (s)he was simply an affirmative action admission or ""good for optics.""

Whoever is believing some or all of these same self-destructive thoughts circulating through you mind, just know that you are not defined by your past failures. As long as you continue to give it your all, you will make the right impression on the right person. I hope this post finds you well, feel free to PM me.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/behfte/today_my_fellow_pgy6_made_me_cry_wellbeing/

She said she had a 3.7 gpa in high school and got all As last semester but I’m not teaching things well enough. I think I have to rationalize that her attitude is ridiculous. She was wanting points back because I asked questions on the exam about concepts she didn’t understand, which I explained she needs to ask questions in class or come to my office hours when she doesn’t understand something *before* the exam. It’s hard because I want to help students who want to do better and she made me feel like I’m an ineffective teacher. I’m probably just dealing with a flare up of imposter syndrome.

1ansjte,College skills high schoolers aren’t looking,"After reading the post about email skills (or lack thereof) and some of the comments about the things students don’t know how to do, I was considering teaching a one day “workshop” for my HS dual enrollment students on things they need to know next year.

So list them below! Other than “make sure you check your emails every day” and how to prioritize those emails between things from the college vs emails to you as an individual, or “how to read a textbook” to look for chapters or in the index…
What do you feel freshmen (or otherwise) don’t know these days that are needed for college success? What should someone explain to them before they get to college?

Edit: thanks all for the comments! Much of it has helped me realize that in the grand scheme of things, most of my students are definitely higher achieving, or at least that I innately teach some of this stuff, which at the very least makes me have less imposter syndrome.
However we are bringing back the senior English in between “regular” and AP/DE, aimed at kids who aren’t ready for those classes but want to go to college.

1mcjjvu,OBGYN vs Gen Surg,"So it's a long story... I've been conflicted between OBGYN and Gen Surg all of third year. I had Gen Surg last and was convinced I wouldn't like it. Everyone in my class I spoke to was sure I wouldn't. I am very lighthearted and I don't take myself too seriously. I am as opposite as you can be from a Gunner while still being a medical student lol.

But I ended up liking Surgery just as much as I liked OBGYN which I had in the Fall of my third year. Specifically Breast and Trauma (excluding the crit care management, I really don't like medical management at all). I love the OR and doing procedures. I am obsessed with abscesses and debridements.

So now I'm a current USMD MS4. My plan for this summer was to do sub-is in both. My first sub-I was L&D night float and it did not go well. I mean I thought it went well but when I got my feedback back from the program I was SHOOK. My third year OBGYN rotation did not prepare me with the skill set I needed to hit the ground running but I'm a fast learner and always came in with a positive attitude and put my best foot forward which I thought would be enough. Long story short--bad grade, no LOR. I'm left without a SLOE which I need to apply OBGYN.

My only option is to give up my STEP2 study block and take another OBGYN sub-i if I want to still apply OBGYN.  I do not think without dedicated study time I will be able to pull much higher than a 230. So my hands are being forced as I need to decided within the next day or two whether to take another OBGYN sub-I at the expense of my STEP2 score or apply surgery.

So here is what I'm struggling with... A huge part of my life prior to medical school was advocacy for reproductive rights and it makes me sad to give this up for surgery. I enjoy counseling on birth control and taking about pregnancy management. I also have an interest in IVF (REI) research and topics which I know I can't pursue in surgery. I didn't care for vaginal births, cervical exams, all of GYN besides the surgical aspects. But I LOVE the younger patient population. I didn't find working with elderly patients rewarding. I also worry with OBGYN as an attending if I will feel appropriately compensated for the hours worked/personal sacrifices, especially given I will likely be the sole breadwinner for my family when my partner and I have kids. I worry it might not be enough surgery for me, especially because I'm not super passionate about a Gyn-onc fellowship as the reason I would do OBGYN is for the OB. I am also worried about it being a female dominated profession. Throughout my life I have struggled in large groups of females (large female friend groups, college roommates, sleep away camps, etc) and am worried OBGYN might not be the place for me to thrive.

For surgery I am worried about being able to survive residency with my mental sanity and relationship in tact. I am worried about ending up having to do more than 5 years like if I had to take a prelim year or do a 7 year program. 7 year program would not be the end of the world but I'll be in my 30s when I graduate med school and the thought of having so much unknown looming over my head with a prelim year & what follows is REALLY unappealing to me. On surgery I struggle with imposter syndrome and feeling like I am not smart enough or qualified even though I am on a  competitive sub-I. I like what I am doing and the days go fast but I'm worried about being able to have a life outside of residency. I would like to still be able to see my partner for an hour or two each day, go to the gym and be able to visit friends on occasion without it cutting into research/professional development. I don't need to go on crazy vacations or anything but I will likely be getting married my intern or PY2 year and would like to have time to do that. Another thought is the OBGYN residents seemed much happier to me and more balanced, however all the surgery residents would always tell me the OBGYN residents had it worse then them. Same with the surgery attending when I said I was deciding between OBGYN and GS they said the OBGYNs had worse hours and got paid less, why would I ever want to do that to myself? Only one OBGYN (resident) ever told me to do obgyn when I said I was deciding between the two.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can figure this out? I'm so confused and it's tearing me apart.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1mcjjvu/obgyn_vs_gen_surg/
1bqdwvd,Sophomore CS major with a 2.07 gpa. Is it over for me? ,"It’s just what the title says. I was never a coding kid but was interested in learning computer science. While applying to colleges I couldn’t see myself in any other major so computer science felt like the perfect choice but the moment I became a freshman, the imposter syndrome hit hard. I never coded before while half my peers already had their own websites they coded from scratch and literally did coding as a hobby. To have a community, I made friends with other cs majors who were total beginners and somehow got through freshman year with the help of friends and chatgpt. I was barely surviving (Bs and Cs) and lost a few friends in cs bc they changed majors after second semester’s OOP course

Then in the first semester of sophomore year, we had DSA and it was dubbed the actual weed out course of our major. It was and it did. I failed that course and my grades in other courses drastically dropped too. Most of my friends switched majors again, i literally don’t have that community anymore. 

While I was trying to survive in this major, go to clubs, network, find internships, hangout with friends and have everything together, two years almost passed. I’ve failed until now and am left with no experience, no good projects and a painful gpa of 2.07. 

I can’t seem to find any internship or research over the summer bc of my gpa. I want to be in computer science and go to grad school but I’m so lost. My transcripts are so bad that I don’t even want my advisor to look at it. I’m scared that I’ve already ruined my chances to bag a good internship, do research or go to a top post grad program. My professors will only consider a student for research if they have a gpa of 3.5 and above. Even if I get a 4.0 in every semester from now, I might not hit that mark.

1m9s4z1,"Starting my PhD in a month, what to do with god complex and imposter syndrome?","Sorry if this sounds narcissistic but I’m having a hard time adjusting my mentality when interacting with my peers. (Also sorry for atrocious grammar, it’s 6am and it’s keeping me up the whole night)

For starters, I’m about to start my PhD straight from undergrad soon, and currently, I have 6 papers, all with citations, 4 conference oral+poster presentations, best paper nomination, and I’ve written my own grant proposal (recently got funded), so I am somewhat prepared. (Started research last April) 

But this leads to another issue, when I’m interacting with my peers (other new grad at same age), I can’t help but feels a sense of superiority in a way, and it’s hard to stay humble, like I have to remind myself hey they just started, like you a year ago, so don’t be pretentious when they don’t know something. But yesterday I almost crashed out at another undergrad student I’m supervising for not knowing how to use GitHub and Linux. And I realized my mentality isn’t at the right place.


And at the same time, when I work with my lab mates, I often feel a sense of inferiority and insecurity. They know way more than I do, do more work than I do, work hard than I do (seriously this is not imposter syndrome speaking im the first one to leave the lab at 5:30pm everyday to go to gym with my buddies). And when we do assigned readings from our pi, they seems to finish way faster while it took me 3 weeks to finish reading and make slides for 40 pages of material. The worst part is, my pi have high expectations of me (want me to finish under 4 years) and I just feel like I’m not cut out for it anymore.

If I downplay myself, I feel fake. If I own it, I feel like a narcissist. If I ask for help, I feel stupid. If I don’t, I feel arrogant. 

How do I deal with this? Anyone feel the same way? Weird mix of god complex and imposter syndrome?

Edit: thanks everyone, after reading some of the comments I realized the issue stems from my toxic view of comparison, you either be better than someone or you’re not. It isn’t right when I judge people on the basis of I can only be better or be worse than them. It’s something I have to work on. In my defense I grew up in China, with ultra competitive parents.

I have no idea how have I reached so far when I feel I’m the most dumb person technically. I know this might seem like imposter syndrome but it is not. I do not remember my fundamentals, I tend to forget what I learn and I cannot bridge my coursework with my research. Because I have a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from great universities, people seem to think I know stuff. I don’t. I cannot for the life of me comprehend technicalities related to running an equipment, acquiring data and presenting it. Added to that, I’m not strong theoretically too. 

Worst part is, I have 6 publications and holistically, my profile does seem good for my pace. However, my PI is very odd and I am unable to understand him. He used to be very hard on me but he’s become more encouraging now. But does not provide any hands on help at all nor gives really good advice. There’s no post doc in my lab or any senior student on the same project. I’ve been trying to run an experiment on a vibrometer but have been failing since 4-5 months. Its manuals are not written very clearly and there’s no resource online to give me a step by step crash course. I need to show my sponsor a demonstration next month and my anxiety is going through the roof knowing I’ll be outed soon enough.

1mf0bp3,I submitted in the most German process imaginable,"Today is Friday.

I was going to submit my thesis on Tuesday. But I couldn't, because the required four(!) printed copies didn’t fit into the letterbox.

On Wednesday, I learned that because my thesis is in English, I need to include a German title below the English one. Naturally, this wasn’t in the layout template but buried somewhere deep in 70 pages of documentation. Also, I had accidentally capitalised the *P* in *Dr. Phil*, which was another no-go. Thank goodness it didn’t fit in the letterbox; because now I had to reprint and re-bind all four copies to fix that page.

On Thursday, on my way to pick up the new copies, I found out that aaaaactually, the German title needs to appear above the German abstract, too. At that point, I gave up, submitted the slightly-less-wrong version, and hoped for the best. The grad office is moving next week, and anything not in the system by Friday would be delayed at least a week. I'd been hoping to submit months ago and had ended up having to finalise the last few changes right after a three-week conference sprint for reasons beyond my control. For contract reasons, I could absolutely not afford to submit any later.

They accepted it – but they didn't look at the abstract page, so this wasn't really reassuring. They also told me it might(!) be officially submitted if the professor signed it off long enough before noon on Friday. 

So today (Friday), I spent three hours refreshing the system page. Nothing. But at 11:50 AM, the status finally flipped from ""is being reviewed"" to ""has been submitted.""

##**Introduction:  About Me & My Journey**

Hello everyone,

I am a data engineer and quasi-software engineer with 4 YOE.  I say quasi-SWE because I'm not that experienced in traditional SWE roles like full-stack, web dev, mobile, etc., but I know enough to be dangerous and am trying to pick it up now.  My main experience is in data engineering using tech stacks like Python, Apache Spark, Data Warehouses like Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks, orchestration tools like Airflow/Dagster, and data modeling frameworks like dbt among other tools.

I've had a lot of career success these past 4 years and have experienced a lot of growth both technically and non-technically.  I spent my first year out of school at an F500 earning 70k/year in NYC, and then during the 2021/2022 hiring boom I made a switch to a fully-remote, boutique consulting firm for 140k/year.  I had other offers in hand, the highest being from a company one step below MANGA for 230k/year TC, fully remote.  I got that offer despite failing two-sum during the technical round as I refused to practice Leetcode on principle.  I am aware that the days of finding opportunities like that via ""spray & pray"" LinkedIn apps are gone, and there's a strong perception that things were ""easy"" back then, and in some ways that's true, but in many ways it's not.

I went to a public, non-target, commuter, liberal arts college.  Zero internships despite submitting hundreds if not thousands of applications each year.  The university career center was useless and had no idea about tech hiring processes.  I didn't even major in CS; I actually minored in it and my major was in linguistics with a focus on natural language processing.  Come graduation, I realized that basically any role in NLP that wasn't data entry requires a Masters at minimum, but much more likely a PhD.  My prospects were really poor, but I had some really good mentors who helped me land on my feet.  My CS skills at graduation were mainly Python scripting, Pandas, some light Java, some SQL, and that kind of stuff.  I was pretty dogshit looking back at it.  I did core CS and math classes like DS & Algos, databases, Calc I and Calc II, linear algebra, and discrete math among others.  I got really good grades, but my experiences showed me that grades are nothing without network, school prestige, soft skills, and company culture fit when trying to get your first role (or any role).

Since then, I've up-skilled a lot.  I got pretty good at building data pipelines, data modeling, devops, developer relations, technical writing, database management, working cross-functionally, and dealing with ambiguity & poor managers.

When I really think about it, my best skills are not my technical skills.  Where I really shine is with my non-technical (aka ""soft"") skills like communication, empathy, collaboration, strategic thinking, and general problem-solving or critical thinking.  When I job-hopped, that's what I indexed on instead of Leetcode, and that's what got me offers instead of being a DS & Algos god.  Many will say ""it was 2021, you were playing on easy mode"", and there's some truth to that, but my counter-evidence is that I've actually quit my consulting job a few months ago, and when I did so, I had a bunch of opportunities lined up in the 150k+ range.  And all of it came from my network.  I decided to chill for a bit and give a crack at independent consulting, and it's been going well so far.

I've also helped two people who graduated this past May optimize their job-hunting processes, and each of them landed a role after 3 months using this process and got way more interviews throughout than before.


##**What I am Offering**

I am offering free, personalized mentorship to 2-4 of individuals who are underemployed, unemployed, or still students but who are struggling to take that next step.  We'd start with one or two 30-minute sessions per week and depending on how things go, over time we can wind that down to once per week, once per month, or as needed.

We would focus on all the things that your campus career center and coursework doesn't teach you.  That is:

1.  Networking.  This is a big one that is a mystery to many (myself included when I was a student).  This will focus on the topic *how to get interviews outside of spamming LinkedIn*

2.  Side projects.  I may not have time to review your code, but I can help assess your skill level & learning style and then guide you towards a project that's realistic, achievable, and impactful for the hiring process.

3.  Identifying your strengths and how to lean into them.  Identifying your weaknesses and developing a plan to bring them up to par.  Identifying your learning style so you know how to get better faster.

4.  Interview Prep.  We will go beyond the basics of *""use the STAR format""* or *""Make sure you can do Leetcode mediums!""*.  I'm working on a framework that leverages all of the above (networking, side projects, knowing your own strengths & weaknesses) + targeted research strategies for the role, company, industry, interviewer to help you position yourself as the **best** candidate for the role.  In other words, we will be discussing **how to sell yourself** even if you do kind of shitty on the Leetcode assessment.

##**FAQ**

### **But if you're not that good of a coder, why are you qualified to give advice?**


I may have a little bit of imposter syndrome myself.  I'm a decent enough coder and I can figure out most things pretty quickly with Google, ChatGPT, documentation, and some reference books.  It's just that the toughest challenges which I've faced these past 4 years were primarily non-technical challenges but rather organizational and management related.  Hence, I got really, really good at solving those problems.

The challenges that I see many of you talking about on this sub in regard to landing a job don't seem inherently technical.  It's not that you're getting interviews and failing technical rounds (though we can talk about that, too), it's that many of you aren't even getting interviews.  Or if you *are* getting interviews and passing technicals, then you're just getting beat by someone else.  That's where I can provide value.

Furthermore, not everyone out there is going to be an elite, programming savant.  And that's okay.  You can still provide a lot of value and be an asset to a company if you complement it with other skills.  I sure as shit am not a savant, and if that's the only kind of person you admire and want advice from, then... well... we probably just won't be a good fit.

### **What's your coaching style?**

I work really well with people who like to push their comfort zone, think outside the box, have a learning mindset, and are adaptive & collaborative.

That is, I may suggest doing something that triggers some social anxiety (like messaging someone or meeting with someone that you don't know that well).  Or maybe we try something experimental or slightly risky, but even if it doesn't succeed, we try to learn something from it and build upon it.  It takes courage, but you gotta push through it.  If you only just want to stay home, talk to nobody, optimize your resume for the 200th time, and spam LinkedIn endlessly, then I won't be that helpful to you.

I focus more on process and outcome rather than output.  For example, you can send out 1,000+ LinkedIn apps (process + output) and get no responses (outcome).  Instead of thinking *""the market is fucked, and there's nothing I can do,""* I work best with people who are open to adopting a mentality more like, *""this clearly isn't working.  Let's keep pushing, but I need to try something different""* (process).  It's like the saying *""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again but expecting different results.""*

### **Why are you doing this?**

I remember how tough it was when I was getting started.  I went to a public, non-target, liberal arts, commuter school with zero sense of how to network or sell myself.  I had hella imposter syndrome and was shy as fuck.  While I enjoyed some aspects of my time at that university, it is basically at the very bottom end in terms of alumni network, career services support, and brand recognition.   I had to push myself and bust my ass to make contacts and figure it out (mostly) all by myself.  If I can help someone get even one step closer to their goal, then I'll feel satisfied.

### **But why for free?**

You guys are either active students shelling out tens of thousands per semester or unemployed/underemployed while struggling to pay back your loans.  I'm extremely blessed in that I don't have loans and have found moderate financial success, and therefore I don't need your money.  And I won't pull some bullshit like ask for a slice of your first paycheck or anything like that if we find success together.

###  **What's in it for you?**

Altruism.  Primarily helping others.  I've considered pivoting into career coaching, and if we work together and you find that my help is really valuable, then maybe that will be enough validation for me to try to monetize my coaching skills in the future.  But for now, that's not the goal.

### **What can you actually help me with in a concrete sense?**

I can't guarantee you a job nor can I guarantee you interviews.  At the end of the day, you are the master of your own future, and I believe that there's often an element of serendipity that cannot be forced.  What I can do is try to help you unblock yourself to put you in a better position to find success.

To put it more concretely, this may look like:

1.  Building up your confidence and helping you push down negative self-talk and imposter syndrome.  This is a big one.  We'd do some introspection and analyze your strengths and weaknesses beyond coding.  There's a lot more to being a productive team member than churning out pull requests.  If you're a weaker coder, then you need to leverage those non-coding skills.  Fortune favors the bold.  There's opportunities out there, but you just need to be more proactive and take some small risks.

2.  Discussing etiquette on how to reach out to cold contacts, request a warm introduction, or run a coffee chat.  Discussing further on how to turn these networking exercises into leads and then hopefully into job opportunities.  The idea is you'll do it with some heavy guidance/hand-holding the first 3-5 times, but you'll get better at it and ""networking"" will not be this abstract, confusing, nepotistic-sounding concept.

3.  Helping you systemize your job search that goes beyond the surface level.  That means doing more than just spam applying on LinkedIn or Indeed.  Spam applying has the lowest probability for success in the current market conditions, and therefore we will focus on higher-probability channels such as building out your network and getting warm intros as well as targeting roles that are *right* for you (fit your goals and you have a real, fighting chance).

4.  Interview prep.  There's a million resources out there on the topic, but the truth is that it really varies from company to company.  We would focus on a more generalized approach where you feel empowered to do all the prep yourself quickly, efficiently, and tailored to each company and interview round.

5.  Discuss side projects, their role in the hiring process, and how to execute something impactful without driving yourself insane or spending months on it.  There's many ways to skin a cat, but even if your skills are severely lacking, there are some side projects you can complete in a single weekend that can help you during an interview.

6.  Lastly, we'd discuss your goals as well as your like & dislikes.


The main idea is every day to get one step closer.  And every week be 7 steps closer.  And every month... you get the idea.  With a proper strategy, things are bound to turn in your favor eventually, despite the current market conditions.  And, frankly, there's no other option than to wait for the Fed to lower interest rates if you just want to spam LinkedIn; however, if you get really good at all that's mentioned above, then you'll be ready to **pounce** when those interest rates are lowered and interview invites are more abundant.

It kind of felt like I was reviewing a different person's work, and I was able to ask myself questions that I never thought of before. In hindsight, I am so grateful to my supervisor for giving me this tip because my examiners ended up asking a lot of questions about the methodology - mostly about why I chose to do this and that. Reading the whole thesis a few days before the defense really helped me understand my own work significantly better and helped me explain/justify all the decisions I made for my research.

**Trusted my supervisor.**

I have bad imposter syndrome, and I tend to shrug off compliments given to me by anyone, including my supervisor. I would usually have a small negative voice inside my head saying, ""Oh, he's only saying that because he doesn't know the whole story"". I am fortunate enough to have a supervisor who rooted for me and I *consciously* chose to believe him when he said that I was ready and that I will do well during our last meeting.

**Breathed.**

I was extremely nervous the day of the defense, and I woke up with a queasy stomach. A podcast I was listening to mentioned that breathing was a remote control of the nervous system, and I can now confirm that this is true. I took **slow** and controlled breaths (5 secs in, 5 secs out) whenever I would feel myself tensing up and it made a whole lot of difference.

**Acknowledged my limitations.**

I was thrown a few questions and suggestions that I *knew* were limitations of my research, and I just humbled myself and thanked the examiners for pointing those out. I made sure to acknowledge what they said, explain (not in a defensive way) why I chose to do this/that, and discuss how I would improve in future research. After the defense, two of my examiners pointed out that they appreciated that I knew the limitations of my own study and that I was open to feedback. It was actually very freeing to know that my research was not perfect (no research IS perfect) and very empowering to hear myself talk about how I would be able to improve it next time.

A lot of people told me to relax because ""I was the expert in the room"" and that everything would go well, but honestly, it was sooo hard to believe those words then. I can now confirm that it *is* true - if you wrote that thesis and did those experiments, then you *are* the most knowledgable person in the room about your own work. I hope this helps our future doctors in this sub! All the best and good luck. :)",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1lgp44d/done_with_my_defense_tips_that_helped_me/
1m2mn0x,Is grad school supposed to feel like this?,"I’m in my first year in my phd. I have a RA position. It’s honestly kinda great, I have a good advisor and a great research group, but I feel like I wake up everyday so scared and anxious. I’m generally just an anxious person so during my first semester I wrote it off as just getting acclimated. But now that I’m nearing the end of my first summer, I honestly feel kinda terrible. I have somewhat relapsed into my eating disorder. I honestly feel unqualified to be in this position, not even in an imposter syndrome way, like in a genuinely I might be unqualified way. Whenever I feel like things are going well, and i’m catching my stride, my advisor tells me i need to pivot and be working on x,y,z.

15yyr3d,I can't PhD anymore,"That basically sums it up.

I never really meant to do a PhD. I had the opportunity during Covid while I was finishing my Master. I took 2 days to prepare the research proposal, sent it, got accepted, and ended up doing a double PhD (university partnership stuff). I had no idea what to expect at first but I was a sucker for academic validation so I was happy. Welp. Not anymore.

I'm 3 years into the programme, a few months away from submission, and I feel like I just can't do it anymore. I had the starter pack of the bad PhD experience : conflicts with supervisors, imposter syndrome, despise of my research topic, isolation, funding problems, absence of support, no access to mental health services, diverging interests between supervisors.  I was called a ""cry baby"" for trying to rise my concerns.

I hate Academia. I hate writing papers, publishing, going to conferences, teaching. I hate my PhD topic and despise the idea of finding a job in this field. I lost value to the eyes of my supervisors when I told them I wanted to leave, so I'm all by myself (except for one professor in the team who called my work 'a waste of time'). I'm burnt out and depressed. Family, friends and partner are in another country while I'm stuck here.

I'm close to the end but I don't have the strenght to continue writing. I'm fighting with myself every single day to write a single word. It's too late to give up so I'll find a way but jeez. I can't believe I willingly decided to put my life on hold for this.

The worst part is that I'm not even sure this will help me get a better job. Are we all some kind of masochists for doing this, or something ?

I had to get this out of my system. Thanks. Now I'll go back to writing.

1km91q2,"Graduated! Master's degree with no undergrad degree, final update","Hi everyone!

This will be long so feel free to TL;DR but hopefully this will answer any future people's questions.

About 2 years ago, I posted a question asking about which schools offered an MFA and didn't require a BA to apply. Over the years, I've gotten messages from people asking about my experiences, etc. but I'm so bad at checking reddit DM's so I figured I'd make a public post as a resource guide.

First, I'm done! Pending the graduation ceremony, I've completed all my coursework including the thesis; so I can confidently say it's possible to do your Master's degree without completing a Bachelor's and wanted share my experiences for anyone thinking of a similar path.

Let's start with the **why**'s:

* I did 3 years of undergrad and withdrew for health reasons. Coming back to finish a BA would have put me +$40k in debt at a minimum. My graduate degree, after scholarship, cost \~$20K.
* I want to be a lecturer and eventual professor, so the MFA being the terminal degree in my field was always the ideal.
* My program is in the top 10 in the country for the field, so I've gotten such valuable support, mentorship and recommendations for future prospects.

Now, the **where:**

* Some people on Reddit really got annoyed by my post last time, so for safety reason I won't say my exact school or field, but here are how I found these schools:
* Google search ""MFA without undergrad degree"". It's niche, but with enough digging, a few programs come to light.
* Emailing department heads; this I did for a PhD, to scout out which schools I might be able to apply for and I was pleasantly surprised at just how many schools gave me the green light to apply this fall.

The **logistics + legality:**

It is 100% legal and acceptable to do several types of Master's degree without completing a Bachelor's. These programs are accredited. The loophole is you are accepted *based on merit* having satisfied *requirements equivalent* to that of Bachelor's degree. In simple terms you say, ""Hey, here are all the ways I've satisfied the equivalent of an undergraduate level of study"".

This is also the case for PhD programs. Several schools even allowed me to apply this coming fall. It is not common at all, and will greatly reduce the opportunities you will be able to take. But it is possible and doable.

**Admission advice:**

* Apply for as many fellowships, residencies, experiences as you are eligible for. Try to publish if that's a possibility in your field. An alternative is career experience, but I didn't go that route so I can't offer much there.
* Speak to admission counselors, attend workshops/conferences were you get to meet professors in the program.
* Read. Read. Read. That's it. Read.
* Believe in yourself. You *have* to believe you are good enough in order to show others that you are.

**The experience & advice:**

One of the biggest worries I had was that I would feel behind when entering the program. However, that was largely imposter syndrome -- what kept me going was that if a program this selective (<8% acceptance rate) accepted me then there was something they saw in my application that was worth pursuing.

The program was both easier and harder than undergrad. Easier because my attention was less split between several 'busywork' classes and I felt like I was jumping straight into studying what I truly wanted. Harder because I was graded not on completion, but quality. Thus, sometimes I had to redo an assignment or proposal because it didn't quite hit the mark.

Otherwise, there was no area I really felt lacking in except when it came to reading. I felt like I had gaps between which prominent people in the field I knew as I imagine undergraduate programs did deeper dives into most of their works.

So my advice to prepare would be read a ton! Read from those in the field you think you'll enjoy and those you'll hate. Read classics, contemporary, commentaries, attend local events, etc. Basically immerse yourself as much as possible in the field. I read +100 books in these two years, some of which could have been cut if I had prepared more ahead of time.

**Pros:**

* Saved a ton of money & time.
* Got to study exactly what I was interested in directly and treated as a peer rather than ""beginner"".
* Networking with members of the field (they always invited industry experts for masterclasses)
* Mentorship from people with the power to help you reach your goal (literally submitted something for a prize and got to work with the judge of that prize after, so they were able to tell me what I was missing)**.**
* Returning to academia *after* becoming well-adjusted and knowing who I am made studying and time-management easier.

**Cons:**

* Some scholarships & opportunities I was not and will likely never be eligible for.
* Having to explain that *yes, it's possible; yes, it was legitimate, etc* will become a norm in various settings.
* If you want a career in academia, be prepared to be limited in options. The job market is already tough, this will make it tougher.

**Financial + Career profile:**

* $45k\~ish in student loan debt that includes the undergraduate degree loans I was taking.
* Non-academic entry level-positions (which are my back up) start at $60k ish which isn't glamorous, but good enough for me who plans to continue being single + no kids.
* Chose to do loans rather than work full-time for the duration of my program but nearly everyone in my class had a full-time job and made it work. Personally, with my health issues, I chose to take out the loan and guarantee my well-being rather than risk burning out and having to drop out.
* I was able to land an Instructor position at a university in a less populated state but had to decline because the offer didn't make sense for relocation. So this boosted my confidence, even though I technically don't have anything set in stone lined up beyond part-time work.
* My fall-back plan is to do PhD apps this fall if I can't land Adjunct/Lecturer positions. The job market is so tough, I don't even want to make any plans until I actually *have* my first day at work.

**Do I recommend this?**

Yes and no. Here is who I recommend this for:

* If you can't finish your BA for any reason *but* know that you are academically at a graduate level in that field.
* Skipping a BA *only* if you've had extensive foundational knowledge in all areas. In my case, I did most of my GE's in a prestigious school after taking a lot of AP's in High School and coming from a country that is fairly more advanced than the U.S. in K-12 education.
* If you're *already* working in the field and see your CV at the level of other MFA graduates or at the very least exceeding your peers.

Here is who I *don't* recommend this for:

* People who want an easy way out of the tediousness of undergrad.
* People who *need* the BA for the advanced degree (Med, Law, etc). Even if by some miracle you find a program that accepts you, this sort of setback will always haunt you.

**In conclusion,**

I don't regret the path I've taken, not in the least. If anything, I'm excited to encourage people to consider non-traditional paths in academia if it makes sense for them. We're already seeing the value of a college degree being questioned in this tech age and thus, I hope that students feel that they can explore various avenues in academia that are outside the norm.

It's not an *easier* way out, just simply an alternative. Some of us need that alternative. For those of us that do, hopefully this post encourages you to research your field and see how viable it would be to try and make your dream come true.

**TL;DR:** I finished my Master's with no undergrad degree and above are my experiences for anyone thinking of a similar path.

1apbx5z,"Prof Won't Give Me Disability Accommodations, DRC No Help :(","I get time and a half for all tests per my accommodations from the DRC, and in previous semesters this has gone perfectly fine. However, I'm in an online class where the professor has not responded to any emails pertaining to my accommodations a month into the semester. Our first exam is due this Friday, and he hasn't added the time, nor has he filled out the Alternative Testing Agreement that all my other profs have.

The Disability Resource Center (DRC) basically said they'll try to email him but if he doesn't respond there's nothing they can really do. His office hours don't happen until the day the test is due, and the DRC closes early that day, so even if he filled it out right then they wouldn't have time to process it. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've never had a prof be so uncommunicative, and this whole situation has made me feel so unwelcome as someone disabled in college. Those imposter syndrome thoughts creep up sometimes, and now they've increased tenfold. It's not like I've been asking for a luxury. I get the feeling he just doesn't want to have to manually change the times for each test of mine...

TL;DR: Prof won't respond to emails to give me my DRC accommodations of 1.5x on tests. First exam is this Friday!

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for the input! I went in person to the DRC today and they managed to contact the professor. I was right that he hadn't been reading the emails, but he's completed the Alternative Testing Agreement and added the time and a half to my tests with no other problems!

1mb7b23,"Grad school starts soon, & I’m seriously questioning if I belong here","I’m starting a biophysics PhD program (in the US) at the end of September, & it’s a field I *absolutely* ***adore.*** At the same time, I’ve been stuck in this weird headspace. I’m not full on panicking, but I’ve been second guessing everything. It’s like the closer it gets, the more I wonder if I’m actually cut out for this

I’m going straight from undergrad into a PhD. No Master’s or in between. & even though I was accepted, it’s hard not to feel like I’m taking the spot of someone who probably has two degrees, more experience, & a stronger foundation than I do

I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like that. Sometimes it just feels like I’m genuinely not ready. I look at other people in my program & think, they probably have published papers, solid research backgrounds, & confidence. Meanwhile I’m sitting here *praying* I can just keep up

All that’s been in my head lately is :
		
What if I’m not actually that smart?

What if I can’t handle the pressure?

What if this whole thing breaks me down before I even get anywhere?

I know how to work hard. I’ve done it before. I know I can get through hard things. I’ve proven that to myself multiple times. I know that grad school is so much more than being smart or a good test taker.

I have my viva next month and I’m absolutely terrified. I feel like I don’t know anything. I genuinely can’t remember much of what I wrote, and I’m convinced I won’t be able to answer a single question in the viva. I’ve been thinking about emailing my supervisor to cancel it altogether.

This doesn’t feel like imposter syndrome—I honestly believe I don’t know enough and I can't seem to convince anyone of that. Despite spending four years on this PhD and writing what I feel is a terrible thesis, I still really want to get my degree if there's any chance of passing.

Even though I’ve tried revising the papers I cited and re-reading my own introduction, I keep forgetting everything. It’s incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like a complete idiot.

Is there anyone who felt like this and still passed their viva in the UK? Is it possible to pass even if your thesis isn’t strong and your answers are weak? Any honest advice, encouragement, or suggestions for how to prepare would be deeply appreciated.

1lfoosh,Job interviews (industry) are giving me terrible imposter syndrome.,"Hi everyone.

I’m graduating with my PhD in a social science. I had a first round interview today at a behavioral science consulting firm and holy shit it gave me terrible imposter syndrome. I studied and am generally familiar with the principles but I found some of the questions to be so out of reach for me. Tell me about a time when you’ve had to present your findings to an audience outside your field? All I could think of to talk about is explaining my research to my family and friends. Like, come on, what else am I supposed to say? I’m a PhD student, I give presentations to my lab, department, and people in my field at conferences. Then they asked me how I would apply my research to a case with a pharmaceutical company. Like, come on, I’m not here to pretend my research is super applicable to industry! I’m trying to leave academia because I hate how abstract it all is. 

I feel like all the alt-ac coaches have lied to us about how qualified we are based on soft skills or whatever, because it feels to me like they wanted me to already have consulting experience as a PhD student. Gah, I don’t think I’m getting a second round invite, maybe I will, but probably not. This just has me feeling super depressed, like surely there should be a way for me to contribute to the economy and be employed after I graduate, but that interview was way more difficult than any of my grad school interviews were! And most jobs are rejecting me without even an interview. God, applying for industry jobs has been wayyyy more difficult than applying to grad school. Like at least 20x harder. Anyone relate?

1mvc2qt,PhD Defence in a week. Nervous.,"So, I know I'm the expert in the room, and nobody knows my concepts and findings better than me (but with my jury, I feel like an amateur when dealing with some of the literature in comparison). I know that this is a recognition of my achievement, and not a test (but it still really feels like one). I know everyone tells me not to stress, and that the fact that I'm even allowed to defend means I basically already have my doctorate (which is true in my country, but I always wonder if I'm going to be the outlier. That my jury haven't actually read my thesis yet, and they'll be so shocked when they do a day or two in advance). 

I'm a person who's struggled my whole life with anxiety (particularly social/presentation anxiety) and have had a big dose of imposter syndrome throughout my whole research trajectory. I feel like I only have a surface level understanding of themes and concepts that have sometimes been suggested to me and I incorporated them without really delving deep on them. 

My defence is in a week, and I'm reasonably prepared, having rehearsed my presentation and now preparing potential answers for questions. But I can't shake the feeling that it'll all come crashing down on me in the moment, that I'll blow it, and that I shouldn't have ever gotten this far. 

Any words of advice for moving past this (partly irrational) feeling? I know I've got things to work on in the long-term, and I am in therapy for my anxiety. But short-term, I don't know how to overcome these feelings I'm so conditioned towards.

Equally, feelings of imposter syndrome and the like were stronger for me during my MA than PhD. I must add that I have the privilege of having a great supervisor.

1f1jx7a,Four months left and I want to quit,"Title says it all. I’m a cancer biology PhD student in the UK.  I have three weeks left in the lab and three months to write up. My thesis is due in December.  My PhD journey has been bumpy from the start.  I changed lab groups within the first four months (actually I changed Institute!!) because my first supervisor was impossible to reach and would cancel meetings on me all of the time - I was feeling helpless and hopeless with the lack of support. After changing lab groups it took me sometime to find my feet again. But with the support of my new PhD supervisor I do feel like I learned a lot and have grown as a scientist. 

However, I have been on my project completely by myself and absolutely panicked on a daily basis about its reproduceability.  I have even asked my colleagues to blind my data for me so that I can analyse it in a non-biased manner, but I still somehow feel like I’ve made everything up.  I don’t trust myself and I don’t trust my data and I don’t feel right writing it up.  Every time I’ve raised this with my colleagues, they’ve told me it was imposter syndrome.  But I’m so sure that in my case it’s not imposter syndrome.  I just feel stupid and incapable.  

On top of that, I feel massively let down by my collaborators. They have sent me reagents which I have worked with for years, which were giving me odd results. Given these agents have been published with, my guidance was: well the data is the data. Which makes total sense I guess. Without diverting the details of my project, I checked if these reagents were actually what my collaborators said they were, and they weren’t. 

I feel stupid for not validating and checking these in the beginning. I feel like I’ve wasted two years of my life generating data that means nothing.  To be honest, I back myself and not checking these reagents because you kind of have to work with good faith, and also these reagents were published with. I’m going to have to write my thesis up with these dud reagents and it just is going to be a pile of crap. 

Furthermore, I work with genetic cell lines which have drifted over the years and I have lost some of my phenotypes. I am constantly panicking about my work being reproducible, I don’t have the strength to continue. Everyone around me has told me that I’ve been doing this for so long I may as well do the final push… but I just don’t know at what cost.  I feel hopeless and stupid every day.

I can acknowledge my growth as a scientist. I just don’t want to write a piece of crap.

1l04u7v,Do you ever feel like the least knowledgable person in the room?,"I'm an M1 nearing the end of my first year, and I’ll be starting M2 soon. At my school, we begin our clerkships in the second year, and I’m feeling pretty intimidated to be working in a clinical setting/talking to patients/treating patients.

Part of that intimidation comes from constantly feeling like the least knowledgeable person in the room amongst my peers\*. In small groups with my M1 classmates, I often feel like I’m the one who knows the least and speaks the most casually (simple words/phrases, brain rot memes...) while everyone else seems to be on another level of intelligence. They use big words, share clever insights, and speak so eloquently. Many of them also have rich life experiences and diverse backgrounds to share, which I simply do not have.

1caum99,The unexpected disappointments of 4th Year. ,"Fourth year is one of the more bittersweet experiences of my life. Maybe that’s a blessing that I haven’t had worse, but it was truly an unexpected disappointment. I’ve officially finished my final rotation, the evaluation is submitted and all that’s required is graduation. You’d think this accomplishment would induce a feeling of freedom - relief, joy, awe, even. Instead it feels like imposter syndrome, as the last 4 months have felt like I’ve been crawling through quicksand to this finish line. It wasn’t pretty. I didn’t show up as my best self to every rotation, even got my first “Below Expectations” in a category and that was an absolute blow to the ego. 

Things I expected to bring joy but brought an overwhelming sense of inadequacy: 

- Spending thousands at audition rotations across the country at programs and cities that excited me, to find out the residency program and fellow trainers weren’t your people and the experience felt off

- Getting my second choice residency in a “easy” speciality, feeling confused that my first choice led me to believe I was ranked to match and then never hearing from them again. Feeling guilty that my first reaction was disappointment in not getting my first choice. 

- Reading my last evaluation on my final day of medical school to see they wrote that I “definitely had senioritis” and had more areas to improve on than praises

An incomplete list of the many experiences that I expected to bring joy, but just made me feel even less motivated. 4th year isn’t a walk in the park and looking back on all my time, I feel like I’ve been trying to run through water that turned to quicksand with the occasional wave that knocks you over, while everyone is watching around you on solid ground expecting you to be so proud of yourself but really you just feel like you’re not moving fast enough.

1i2qob3,I passed my viva but...,"I passed my viva this week with corrections. I am excited, however, the way in which the examiner framed the decision really made me feel negatively about passing. One of my examiners was really tough during the defence and at times, I felt, patronising. After the deliberation, this examiner said ""We have decided to award you the PhD but there are a number of corrections required"" and then went on to detail what those corrections were. I have seen videos and people saying that the examiner usually gives you a brief moment to acknowledge that you passed, but I wasn't really given that opportunity as she went straight into what corrections would be expected of me. After announcing the decision and the corrections, the examiner did say that my thesis was beautifully written and I had a sophisticated understanding and creative application of theory, but I just felt confused by her demeanour. I know I have passed and that's the most important part, but I can't help but feel like she was on the fence about passing me and didn't want me to be too excited about passing. I might be over thinking it, but I feel a bit like a fraud if that was the case.

I'm 25 years old and currently pursuing my undergraduate in Biotechnology. To give y'all a background I'd done my Bachelor's in hotel management in 2020 and got placed in one of the best hotel companies in my country as a trainee chef. During my time training there, I struggled through major imposter syndrome and developed an anxiety disorder that still plagues me to this day. I eventually quit and decided to go back to college to study the bachelor's degree I'm doing rn in hopes of eventually one day doing my PhD and becoming a professor. I made this decision back then assuming my mom's got my back.
Recently my mom's been asking me to want to know what is the path like as 2 years of my undergraduate is done rn. So I laid down the best possible scenario with me having completed my PhD by 33. Recently with my mom being diagnosed with arthritis and other related mobility issuesand given out financial situation she has been saying that she can't be supporting me for that long as a single parent. She wants me to get ""settled"" as soon as possible so that I can keep up my current lifestyle. I don't know man when ever she brings about this I start panicking and feel like the world is closing around me. I refuse to undergo the same treatment I did back then.

I see a lot of angst and imposter syndrome in this community regarding academics. This is your reminder that getting to your intended destination *eventually* is all you need to do. 

You don't have to be the fastest or the smartest. A setback to your research or a dump grade won't destroy you. It's okay to take a gap year if you need it. Sometimes, the right thing comes along at the wrong time. It's fine to gather your resolve and try again later.

If I can come back from an abject academic disaster such as this then you can weather an extra semester to polish your thesis. You can bounce back from that failed exam. And if you can't quite manage to pull it together right now, well...that's okay too.

1jbx62d,Quitting in year 4,"I'm a fourth year PhD student in BME at a high-ranking R1 institution, and I feel like I can't do this anymore. 

I have had doubts all throughout my program of whether I am qualified to pursue a PhD. At every major benchmark I'd give myself an opportunity to quit. First year - if I don't make good results on a project, I'd quit. Second year - if I didn't get the GRFP, I'd quit. Third year - if I felt shitty after my A exam/proposal, I'd quit. 

However, in my fourth year, I'm feeling imposter syndrome at its worst, but also the sunk cost. Both of my projects have come up empty. One was a major screening study, and it seems like there isn't anything to find. More pressingly, my other project (which I had no experience in, but thought I could teach myself everything) has a glaring flaw that I could've figured out six months ago if I'd done better lit review and analysis. 

My advisor is so supportive and kind, as is my committee, I do think if I stick it out, I could pivot and finish before my funding runs out (I have two more full years). Also, my dream was always to be a teaching faculty member - I love my TA duties, they keep me going. But everyday I wake up hating myself, my research, my life, and feel like I can't keep going. Should I just quit? 

Edit: A little late, but I can't thank you all enough for your supportive words! It means so much to me, and want to thank everyone who took the time to comment! ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1jbx62d/quitting_in_year_4/
1d2qp2k,Spiraling,"Today I read my course evaluations for the spring semester, which I admit wasn't my finest semester. I received very positive feedback, except for one devastating comment that was among the most brutal I've gotten in 15 years of teaching higher ed. I am trying to acknowledge the positive feedback I received, but of course the negative comment is taking over and causing me to spiral (should I get out of this profession? how can I ever teach again? what can I do differently?). I recognize that the student was a lone voice of dissent, but I also recognize that a lot of what they said is true. (I know who it was, given the other comments they left on end-of-semester reflections.) It feels like they are confirming the feelings of inadequacy and imposter syndrome that I often experience. I've already started revising my syllabus for the fall, and I'm trying to push myself to try new things in the classroom and not give up when students are non-responsive. I teach mostly first-year writing, and I have a PhD in English with a focus in rhetoric and composition. I'm finding it harder and harder to teach this course, especially post-Covid, because students don't participate or engage like they used to (or so it seems to me). 

What do you all do when you receive such feedback? How do you push it to the back of your mind? And how do you keep your high-contact courses fresh and enjoyable for you? ",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1d2qp2k/spiraling/
14rfrn6,I'm a Fraud,"So I don't do the work. This is not me exaggerating or being overly sensitive: if I do an hour of work each week, then it is a lot. I just can't get myself motivated. Not having any strict hours, no strict deadlines.. it just doesn't work for me and makes me feel useless and lazy.I know that I am not. I do volunteer work, I take over tutoring roles for several professors and all were and are happy with my help. I love to help others, but I am horrible at being a PhD student.

It is so frustrating as I'm actually self-sabotaging. It isn't like I can't do it, or it is difficult. I have a great supervisory team, lovely colleagues. I have everything going for me but I can't do it.

In the first year I thought it was just imposter syndrome. New country, new position, it isn't odd to feel off-kilter. I would adjust soon enough. Now, I'm a second year and it still feels the same.I was supposed to publish one chapter soon. Supervisor advised to get help, probably thinking I'm getting stuck but not realizing that I'm just not doing anything.

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I know that publishing once will help remove all those feelings of incompetence, but that will never work if I can't get myself to actually finish it. Meanwhile, I hate myself more with every single day.

I honestly want out, but I don't want to dissapoint anyone. My parents are so proud and all my friends go on and on about how lucky I am. All the while I feel like buying a plane ticket and dissapearing.

The worst of all? Two years ago, I would have loved this and have been enjoying every minute of it. I was an extremely ambitious master student which landed me a specialized job in a very remote location. It was a dream job but we were only with 5, almost no contact to the outside world, living in one house. And one of those housemates was an actual nightmare. For the whole year she drove us (it wasn't just me who had the issue) crazy and I was desperate to get out.

So I left my dream job and got a PhD, as that was what I had originally wanted to get after my masters. Only I feel like that experience changed me. My ambition is gone, and I don't want to be a professor anymore. I am happier at my student job working in a little shop, then ever in my office.

Honestly I am annoyed at my own self-pity. I want to kick myself and just scream 'just start!' but it doesn't work. I suppose on the positive side I have written a novel in the mean time. That is something.

Thank you for listening to my monologue, writing it out at least helped me feel less horrible.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update:  
I will be honest, I hadn't expected this much attention. Thank you reddit for being a listening ear, even if I have no one to understand in real life, it is nice to see that I'm not alone.   
I do often lurk here but see mostly threads about people in horrible supervisor/university situations, but not many times where the problem is solely on the PhD student themselves. Even if my vent wasn't intended to help others, if you are feeling similar: you are not alone and I hope you find something to help you in the comments

Maybe some extra info, I'm a woman, studying in Scotland but originally from an EU country. I am the first in my family to study, so there is some famillial pride putting extra pressure.  
I am a marine biologist and had a very adventurous hands-on job before on a deserted island. This was an amazing experience that taught me about self-reliance and removed me completely from 'modern' life. The reason I left that job is because of the housemate and the consequences it had for me mentally. Each of us would be offshore for a while and when she would be gone, all my symptoms would be gone too (and as I said, I wasn't the only one, actually everyone but her left after that year).  
I absolutely adore my subject, though I wished I had a bit less desk work. I love living here. Supervisor is great though inexperienced (I'm her first student and she is a bit of a perfectionist, but we can laugh about it). Colleagues are lovely, Scottish people in general I found to be amazingly open and sweet (before you scots deny it: I have lived in 4 countries before, this isn't just me speaking out of nowhere).  
As stated before: I have everything going for me but myself :')  

It is funny honestly, this comment section reflects very much all my own thoughts and confusion: from just finish what you started, to 'have I ADHD/depression/...', to: I should quit cause continuing will only ruin further career aspects..  
Nobody in the end knows but me I suppose.   
I will say though that I have a diagnosis of failing anxiety, which might be a factor. I have had the problem in the past of not wanting to do a thing, because not trying is better then failing.  
(Again, great attitude 100% recommend => this is sarcasm)

The seeking mental health help is necessary, I know this. I have more than once almost made the appointment. The university has student counceling and I know that healthcare does cover mental health. So what stops me? I have no great excuse, just that it isn't always this bad, although I'm never stellar on top of everything, I am not always this much of a mess either. So everytime it is this bad, I sleep on it and think: 'drama queen, just get on with it'.

I do recognize though that this can't continue. I am normally a determined person who knows in the first month if she will do something or it needs to change. This time is different. I don't know if I don't want the PhD, or if I am struggling due to the failing anxiety. Maybe the job experience just completely changed me as a person, the person before would have loved a PhD, but the me now just wants stability and the feeling like I'm not horrible at my job.  


Anyway no conclusions, if I ever find the answer I will state it. Oh and for my weekly assignments:

\- Get the intro and material and methods written for supervisor  
\- Set up meeting with possible new supervisor to have insights into alternative methods  
\- Rerun the analysis and see if it is still insignificant. Prepare powerpoint and questions for the potential meeting.

Let's see if I manage.

nqwmir,Cried in front of my post-doc,"Today my post-doc came up to me and said ""please answer this question honestly: do you have any idea what is going on here?"" I didn't bawl my eyes out, but I got choked up and a few tears spilled over as I finally admitted that no, I don't have a clue what is going on. 

For context, I am a first year STEM PhD student. With COVID, imposter syndrome, and my minimal research experience, this year has been a confusing mess with little opportunity to learn/build up my skills. I was brought into a lab on a research assistanceship to complete a funded grant. My advisors stress learning through trial and error, but in practicality they have provided little room for failure/growth and expect a lot of independent progress with little guidance. With how much time had passed, I felt like I could never speak up and ask for help. The times I had, my advisors told me to ""be more independent"" and to figure it out on my own. 

Throughout this year, the post-doc in my lab has been a saving grace. He runs the show and has been extremely supportive and open to teaching me even the most ""basic"" concepts. He was extremely gracious and has taken it upon himself to now have weekly/daily meetings with me to 1) acually go through what we are doing and 2) plan out what I'm supposed to be doing. He even revealed the same happened to him when he was a first-year PhD and that I will have to carry on the tradition. 

Part of me is relieved and part of me is completely ashamed. Like I could finally admit that I needed some serious help, but it has taken almost a year to get to that point. I feel as though I have let myself and the project down by just being so lost and unsure - almost like this year has been a complete waste. I have spent so much time wanting to drop out, too. Plus, it is so embarrassing for someone to see right through you.

 I'm trying to see the positives of the situation - I'm finally getting the help I need and I will hopefully feel less miserable. Failure is part of learning, and maybe now I can start moving forward. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Or any advice about how to handle these feelings?",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nqwmir/cried_in_front_of_my_postdoc/
1mwsi32,How do people become an expert through a PhD?,"Hi,

I am a rising 2nd year STEM PhD student at a T10 school. I never realized until I boarded on my PhD that I have been suffering from imposter syndrome since many years, maybe, since my high school time. However, I diagnosed myself by noticing that I am unnecessarily making my life more difficult. Or, maybe, I am wrong.  
Before I joined the PhD program, I'd articulated my interest in learning/utilizing a lot of new techniques. Interestingly, the nature of the research my PI conducts is in complete agreement with what I always have dreamt of and I should emphasize it is very unique(please believe me!). My professor is pushing a particular frontier in biology by developing engineering tools. To date, different students in the lab used to develop and take care of those tools individually. Therefore, when they graduate, they might be able to identify themselves as experts in those particular fields. But the project I work on demands the application of all of those tools to establish proofs so that our approach can be proven practical in real cases. No doubt, I will be able to publish a lot of papers from this project. But I am afraid as I am only going to apply a lot of techniques to prove something to be practical, I might have only shallow knowledge about all of them. It's like becoming jack of all trades but master of none. Moreover, I don't consider myself a prodigy, rather I would potray myself as merely a science enthusiast. It might not be possible for me to learn and be expert on all of these tools what our lab develops within my limited PhD period. How should I make my plan so that I can call myself an expert/master on at least one of the tools after I graduate? Or, how should I change my perspective about ""expert""?

13nf83t,Another instructor copied my syllabus - normal?,"I’m a part time instructor in an academic English program, going into my 6th semester teaching a course.

For scheduling reasons, I can only teach 2 sections this semester. I was curious about what the other instructor was going to do in his course, so i took a look at his syllabus in the shared folder. It’s exactly the same as mine, with just his name, e-mail, and section numbers changed. Of course a lot of it is university-lawyer-written boilerplate stuff, but the parts I spent hours to customize are all copied. Same schedule I slaved over (it’s a weird combined-levels class where different groups of students attend on different days; setting it all up and getting all the dates in was non-trivial); same clear attendance policy (adapted from the program’s boilerplate text to make it clearer for our English-learner students); same activities, etc. Even the section about plagiarism.

How would you handle this? On the one hand, I’m somewhat flattered. As a part-time instructor with only a master’s degree, I definitely suffer from imposter syndrome at times. On the other hand, I don’t think I would ever do such a thing, especially without even a quick email to the other instructor. I might start from what they had done and then adapt it significantly, but never directly copy.

I’m wondering if it’s worth saying something to my program head or not. I’m also concerned for his students, since I had some basic things like “Canvas instructions quiz due” in the schedule, and I know what that is but he and his students won’t.

What would you do in my position?


UPDATE: I reached out to my program head (exact text in the comments) and got this back:

>	Dear Mobius,

>	Thanks for your message, and I'm sorry for this. [Copier] didn't receive his contract until after syllabi were due, so I think he probably pulled yours just to get something submitted as soon as he could. I'm going to message him about changing it today. I don't condone the stealing of other adjuncts' syllabi at all. Using one of my own standard syllabi would be different, but you developed this, and I think it's yours. I'll have him change things.

>Thanks again!


>Take care, [program head]



So it’s basically what I thought it was. The copier signed on late, and my head wasn’t cool with it (as I strongly suspected he wouldn’t be given our past interactions).

Past tense the operative word, here. I got into this to teach, then right before comps something shifted in me where I stopped seeing sociology as useful for the questions I had, but I kept going, didn't even consider quitting.

During the pandemic, I really lost my way, upon reflection. I received no direct mentoring, my chair acted as a guide but no one was in my area of interest. I didn't keep up reading and engaging, nor did I have a cohort to really engage with - work really hinders that. 

I'm struggling now with the first of a 3-article dissertation that needs completing by August. My first chair went emeritus, the 2nd chair is leaving the school. My (honest?) assessment is that I don't think I did the work to finish this. I struggle with the facility to explain clearly and simply what I'm doing, and feel lost even talking casually about sociology. Not sure if anyone else got to this point and felt dumb but it feels downright embarrassing. But I don't know what to think because, hey, imposter syndrome.

Imposter syndrome is slowly creeping in and I'm starting to freak out about write up. Sooo, any tips/tricks/hacks (in particular for reading and writing but general advice is also welcomed) would be greatly appreciated!

1fg8rxr,The Unexpected Lessons of My PhD Journey,"
When I first started my PhD, I thought it was all about the research. I had this vision of becoming an expert in my field, publishing papers, and solving big, important problems. I knew it would be hard, but I imagined myself finishing in a blaze of glory, ready to take on the academic world.

It turns out, the PhD journey is rarely as linear as we imagine.

The first year was a blur of excitement. I read everything I could, met with my advisor often, and felt like I was on the right track. But by the second year, the honeymoon phase started to wear off. Experiments failed, papers got rejected, and imposter syndrome hit me like a freight train. Suddenly, everyone seemed smarter, faster, and more accomplished than me.

There were times I questioned why I had even started. Was this worth it? I watched friends leave academia for jobs with real paychecks and real hours, and I wondered if I had made a huge mistake. Every time I hit a roadblock in my research, it felt like a reflection of my own abilities. The pressure built up, and there were days when I didn’t want to open my laptop at all.

But here’s the unexpected lesson I learned: A PhD isn’t just about the research. It’s about resilience.

I realized that failure is an inherent part of the process, not a sign that I wasn’t good enough. Slowly, I learned to accept that mistakes weren’t something to be feared but rather embraced. Every failed experiment, every rejected paper, taught me something valuable. I learned how to think critically, adapt, and solve problems in ways I never imagined when I started.

More importantly, I learned how to take care of myself. I started setting boundaries, asking for help when I needed it, and finding a balance between work and life that allowed me to keep going. I joined a writing group, found friends who were going through the same struggles, and leaned on them when things got tough.

Now, in my final year, I look back and realize the PhD journey wasn’t just about producing a dissertation – it was about growth. I’m not the same person who started this program. I’m stronger, more resilient, and more capable of handling the unknown.

If I could give one piece of advice to anyone starting or thinking about a PhD, it would be this: You’ll learn as much about yourself as you will about your field. It won’t always be easy, but if you embrace the challenges, you’ll come out the other side stronger than you ever imagined.

1cfoomm," [UPDATE #1] Survivor of purity culture and homeschooling, NOW they're proud of me?!","SUGGESTION WELCOME!  
I am almost done with my dissertation, and it is time to write the dedication.  
Part of me wants to simply honor my younger self and her passionate pursuit of learning. Part of me really wants to stick it to my parents and read them for filth.

I would love to hear your suggestions!

  
Some ideas I have had so far:

""This dissertation is dedicated to any homeschooled or unschooled child who was told they were not smart enough to go to college; you are capable of more than they are able to acknowledge, and your intelligence is not measured by your academic experience as a kid. For that teen girl who loved learning and snuck downstairs to research college applications on the family computer in the middle of the night, so she would not get in trouble for ""disobeying God's plan for her as a woman""; may you continue to rebel in the best ways! For the person who's educational journey has been nontraditional; your timeline is not wrong, and you are not too late. For the woman who feels trapped by the subjugation of confining religious gender roles, just because he is angry does not mean you did something wrong. To anyone who thinks they are not enough, who has a loud inner critic and imposter syndrome; you can do hard things, even if they are scary.""  
This feels really wordy to me, and I kind of want to keep it super short, more like a book dedication, maybe? I hope to hear your ideas!

TL;DR:

Grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive home with a violent dad and bully for a mother. Survived religious trauma from family and church. Survived CSA from the age of 4-8 by extended family member. Purity culture is rape culture and so I didn't tell anyone for many years, and even when I finally told my parents they blamed me and then pretended like nothing ever happened. My parents ""homeschooled"" us but really we barely got anything beyond 6th grade. My parent believe college is a ""waste of time and money"", and not a place for women, that women belong in the home, raising and homeschooling their children. My greatest rebellion was going to community college. There I had to take a year of remedial courses just to get into the freshman gen-eds. Began volunteering with youth, and learned that I loved supporting teens struggling with suicidality. Learned that mom had NPD and dad has BPD (I did not diagnose them, they received those from two psychiatrists, who they then promptly fired). I went to therapy, learned I am not the ""stupid little bitch"" and ""cancer in our family"" that my mother likes to tell me I am. In my mid twenties I went no contact with my parents. Realized I wanted to help suicidal teens in a clinical capacity, so get a master's degree in counseling and I am now about to graduate with a PhD from a top-five university in my field. Even though I am no contact and have been for almost 8 years now, I learned that my mother has been taking credit for my education, saying that her homeschooling is what enabled me to get this PhD.

1l3kdbk,Do You Ever Get Over Imposter Syndrome?,"I am at a point where I am basically dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s before I’m officially able to start my PhD in the fall. For context, of all of the grad opportunities I applied to, this project was the most prestigious yet least related to my undergraduate research and experience. Despite this, my prospective PI has been super supportive– checking in and advocating for me throughout the application and onboarding process.

Thing is, even though I’m like 95% of the way there, I constantly worry the other shoe is going to drop. That someone’s going to be like, “oh turns out your GPA isn’t high enough/something went wrong/etc. and we don’t like you, sorry.” There’s also a part of me that feels like I’m lying even though I’m not– because there must be \*some\* trickery going on to make these people believe I’m a good fit for the project. I was confirming some of my information last night for their internal systems and even felt like that was a lie. 

I guess my question is, is that something you ever get over? Maybe being an autistic lesbian has made me more susceptible to this instinct, but I feel like I’m just not used to things working out for me and I get anxious when they do. Have people dealt with that kind of insecurity/imposter syndrome before? Does some of that go away when you actually start your research?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1l3kdbk/do_you_ever_get_over_imposter_syndrome/

I want to do good research that gets at helping the Black community, but I feel like I have to do a lot of defining and explaining the problem.

I know people have different experiences, and maybe I’m just not cut out for that type of work environment, but wondering what other people’s experiences are and whether you would recommend it to PhD hopefuls.

1enk2u4,Forced to teach something I don’t know. ,"So I’m a visiting lecturer in a design program. I teach mostly introductory courses in general design topics and animation. 

In May, I was told they wouldn’t need me for the next school year. So I started looking for other jobs, and was struggling. Right after finals, I was called by the professor (who coincidentally taught me in grad school) who had a plan to get me back. The issue was I’d need to teach a course for interactive design in the spring. That includes coding HTML and CSS. Which I never learned or used. 

Knowing my only alternative to accepting was losing my only income (I live alone in a mid COL area) I accepted. He told me the coding was easy. I have already learned the basics and then some of HTML. I know, realistically, I can do this and it’s my own inner critic dragging me down. But I feel so discouraged when I think about teaching it. I just think about what the students deserve, which would be someone who’s been coding for years. But I couldn’t refuse this opportunity, it’s what I love doing and (more importantly) pays me enough to live alone. 

I suppose in the art/design field, it’s common to branch out into new topics and have to teach yourself. I suppose I’m just looking for reassurance from others who may have been in a similar situation. I can’t exactly tell my fellow faculty that I don’t know what I’m teaching (yet.)

1jlbju1,Please help me decide between two very different PhD offers!,"I feel incredibly grateful to be in this position and this decision is weighing on me. I have thought about this and talked to some people but I'm so stuck because the programs are very different.  Here is my pro and con list, which has been helpful understanding the differences but some points hold more weight than others. Would love to hear from other perspectives about what I should be thinking about!! Thank you 🙏

Program A: speech, language, hearing science in boston

* At my undergraduate university, but different program
* Top 10 program in the subfield but overall university is a T50

Pro

* Already matched with faculty whose research and mentor style aligns very well with mine (speech  motor control and Parkinson's disease)
* I wouldn’t have to move and I love living here
* Flexible course selection
* Qualifying project instead of exam
* Easier to get a faculty position in this field due to demand
* I’m familiar with the resources and people here already (I have old mentors who would work in the same building I would be studying in)

Con

* higher cost of living (the stipend is basically the same)
* No master’s degree
* Potentially limited options outside academia
* Already have taken advantage of my network connections here
* Vibes of the lab were fine but not amazing (small, eclectic, not the most social)

Progam B: biomedical engineering in chicago

Pro

* prestige, T10 university
* Opportunity to live somewhere else and be at a different school (i’m still in my 20s)
* Lower cost of living (for the same stipend)
* Master’s degree built in
* Opportunity to get a free DPT (tho would add 2.5 years)
* Optional rotations
* More job opportunities outside of academia
* Expand my network
* Better health insurance
* Current grad students seemed cool and happy
* Potential cohert/ prospective students were very cool
* Lots of career development opportunities

Con

* Move across the country (make new friends, break my lease)
* My partner who I live with will have to find a new job (he’s been at the same job 5 years)
* Research interests don’t align as well as the other program but are still close (general motor control and neuroimaging)
* More imposter syndrome
* Post-grad academic positions more competitive
* No mountains, where am I going to hike??

I spent months studying on topics that they told me too, and then I got there and they asked me questions on things I had no clue about, and this was just the first chapter....So, for the next 2 hours I was holding myself together, until they told me to leave the room for them to discuss.

While I was waiting, I realized how much of an idiot I made of myself and just broke down. Eventually my advisor came to get me, but once I start crying it's hard to stop, so she ended up telling me that I passed right there, but I still feel like I don't deserve it. Even hours after it happened, I feel worse about it. Like somehow they didn't see what I saw, which was that I'm not smart enough to get a phd and completely embarrassed myself. Before I took my exam I felt the imposter syndrome, but now after I've passed, I feel even more like I shouldn't be here. But obviously I'm grateful, and will do everything I can to improve and be better for when I do my final defense.

But has anyone ever felt the same way after passing their qualifying exams or not been happy?

Edit: Thanks everyone for giving me their perspectives. I always heard that your committee wants what's best for you, but in that moment it just felt like a failure, even though I passed.

I do well enough in my classes but I feel constant imposter syndrome because I haven't done any personal projects like my classmates or know how to code that well.

I kind of want to stay in the tech realm so that I won't lose most of my credits, but I'm nervous about switching because I've heard that the jobs that would be available to me as an information systems major or even a data science major would be attainable with a CS degree, but not the other way around. The number one thing I care about is getting a job out of college, which is probably the worst thing for a CS major to expect rn lol.

These feelings didn’t come out of nowhere. They’ve been haunting me since my undergrad days. I was a C student, rarely ever got A’s. My academic advisor even suggested I quit my major because I “wasn’t cut out for it.” I seriously considered it but somehow managed to scrape through to graduation. My CGPA was the lowest in my batch, and when I graduated, I still had no idea what I had learned. My degree feels like a source of shame, something I’d bury and forget about if I could.

When I go to my department and see the students and lecturers, I feel like a stranger, like I don’t belong there. It feels like a place for geniuses, not for someone dumb like me.

When I got into my Master’s program, I swore I’d turn things around. It was coursework based, no research involved (just a project paper in the final semester), and there wasn’t even a viva voce to stress over. To my surprise, it went really well. I aced my courses, earning 99% A’s, and my supervisor was incredibly kind. She encouraged me to turn my project paper into a thesis, helped me present at conferences, and even co-authored two papers with me. I finished with no corrections on my paper, which felt surreal.

But even with all that, I couldn’t shake the imposter syndrome. It all felt like a fluke, like sheer dumb luck, not my effort or abilities. Deep down, I still see myself as the same pathetic, clueless C student I was in undergrad.

Now I’m here in a PhD program, where the stakes are higher, the journey tougher, and there’s no smooth path or lucky breaks to rely on. Part of me is excited by the challenge, but the doubt weighs so heavily. I’m terrified I’ll give up when it gets too hard, and I don’t want to disappoint myself again. I don’t want to choose comfort over a long-term challenge that could change my life.

I fear the comprehensive examination next year. I’m terrified I won’t pass it. But even before that, I’m struggling with the literature review. Reading papers feels like an impossible task. I procrastinate because I’m scared I won’t understand them. And when I do read, I often get stuck on certain information, unable to make sense of it, which leaves me frustrated and feeling even more inadequate. Literature review feels like hell.

I want to break out of this mindset and become someone I can be proud of, someone who can look back in a few years and say, “I can’t believe I did it.” I want to feel like I belong in this journey.

1845wuc,Struggling with life after doctorate,"Hello everyone. I completed my 4 year doctorate back in May. I have a great job but recently ended a 5 year relationship and I’m back living at home. I feel my doctorate destroyed my mental and physical health and I can’t seem to shake it off. Logically I know my life is okay. Everything is fine now. Most of my stress is gone. But it’s like my body is still responding as if it’s in stress mode. All I want to do is sleep. I can’t get exciting about anything. Still have imposter syndrome. Wondering why my cohort is doing so well now and I’m not. I’m also 35 and female and with ending the relationship i kinda feel like a loser as I’m now advanced maternal age and my mom who I live with is desperate for grand children. I lost a lot of weight in grad school and muscle mass. It totally jacked up my stomach so I have major stomach issues still. I have a hard time sleeping. Sometimes I wake up panicked for no reason. Again, I can tell myself logically everything is fine but my body seems stuck in this PTSD phase. I feel so self conscious about my looks, my personality, etc. before grad school I felt on top of the world. Killer confidence, super happy, excited about my future, good relationship, good social network, excellent physical fitness. 

I am trying to force myself to eat better and exercise but it’s hard because the motivation isn’t there. I try to be social but feel dead inside and want to isolate instead. I guess returning back home I feel like no one understands what I went through. My relationship ended becasue I was so depressed I couldn’t function so I removed myself from our house (which I picked out) to go back to my little bedroom at my mom’s. 

Can anyone else relate? What do I do? I’m afraid this is just who I am now. How long will it take me to feel healthy and happy again?!",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1845wuc/struggling_with_life_after_doctorate/
1hiwgfz,Study methods that avoid Anki with a ten-foot pole,"I have passed my first three exams but not by much (used Anki for these). The fourth exam covering the hematopoietic system absolutely defeated me. Ironically this is the test where I really dug deep into Anki, so failing this exam has left me feeling confused and lost. I am looking to reshuffle my study methods and am looking for any study suggestions that DO NOT involve Anki. Please share if you are feeling kind. Also please be specific.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Based on the comments following my post, I would like to reiterate a few things.

How I studied for my previous hematopoietic unit

1. Watched Bootcamp video, took generous notes on the video.
2. Unsuspended the cards on Anki related to the video
3. Did the cards, eventually unsuspending around 950 cards by the time the exam came around.
4. Did around 130 practice questions on AMBOSS
5. Watched most of the lectures at 3x the speed and made minor cards on things that deviated from Bootcamp
6. Fell behind - how? Anki is such a huge time sink; felt I was memorizing the cards and not actually ""learning"" the information. Yall prob know what Im talking about. None of the facts were connecting in my mind.
7. Take test
8. Find out I failed (two standards deviations below the class average)

this prof is very kind and wants me to be first author, and now i got an email from them about dividing up the work and they are still very involved in writing big sections of the paper. i'm looking at it and wondering if i deserve being first author, considering eventho i did the analysis, it's not my idea to investigate the topic in the first place.

1mluzmq,Anxieties starting my humanities PhD,"I will be starting a PhD in comparative literature this September at an American university, and am feeling anxious about being unprepared. I am starting this PhD directly after a bachelor's, and I see that a lot of my peers seem to already have Master's experience. I am worried I will fall behind what is expected of me as a student when it comes to my knowledge of the field, and also with regards to language preparedness. I am unsure if this is a real anxiety to have that I should prepare for, or if this is just imposter syndrome. 

Additionally, while I applied to the program with a specific research interest built around my undergraduate thesis, I am actually quite unsure about what I want to be researching (because I have a lot of broad areas of interest), and feel like I lack a clear enough plan/path forward. How much opportunity would I have to explore with my coursework?  
  
Finally, is it normal/okay to delve into a subject area in my PhD that I lack prior experience in? For example, I wrote my undergraduate dissertation and have experience with South Asian Hindi/Urdu literature cinema, but have also been learning Japanese as a hobby, and was wondering if I could use that for my PhD as well, despite having minimal knowledge of East Asian/Japanese studies. 

Tldr, I feel a bit all over the place, and would like to hear about other humanities PhD students and what their first few years looked like. ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1mluzmq/anxieties_starting_my_humanities_phd/
1me3bcn,Difficult PhD advisor,"Just venting about my PI. For context, I have two co-supervisors. PI1 I've had since my masters, she's honestly the best and is so sweet and supportive. She was a big reason why I continued my PhD at this school and she continues to be great. PI2 on the other hand I've only had during my PhD. She's an expert in the subject, while PI1 knows more about the methods, so is definitely a necessary part of my team. I didn't know much about the subject before starting my PhD, but the skills and methods I've learned from my Masters has been transferable, but there has been a bit of a learning curve when it comes to the subject. 

However, PI2 since the beginning has been very short with me and we never really clicked the way she's clicked with her other students. She is not someone who is good with positive feedback, so only focuses on the negatives and highlights everything I do wrong, which makes it feel like I'm always wrong and don't know what I'm doing. She also doesn't handle stress well, so when she is stressed she seems to really go hard on me. Honestly, her whole personality gives me whiplash sometimes. 

I'm not sure if it's normal to feel like I'm not in charge enough of the project, sometimes it feels like I don't make decisions enough. I have days where I am so confident with what I do and with my knowledge, and then I meet with her and she drops me down a peg which makes my imposter syndrome go crazy and I've become so anxious before meeting with her. I meet with both my advisors weekly just to quickly go over what I've been working on. I work pretty independently but I started to doubt everything I do and constantly scared of making mistakes. I only have a year left of my program but my motivation is starting to dwindle because of it.

1hiyhma,Proud and relieved,"On Tuesday, I found out that my Master's Paper proposal was nominated for a research award given to the best proposal in my department. I honestly had no expectation of receiving a nomination. I'm pretty quiet and reserved, so I figured I might fly under the radar. I definitely have put a ton of effort into this paper, though, so this recognition means the world. 

I've dealt with a lot (mental illness, ADHD/autism, etc) to get to this point. I had a somewhat difficult time in undergrad and had to take a semester break from my master's program due to my ED and mental health. All of this has led to a major sense of imposter syndrome.

1jf79ik,Advice Needed. Is right now the worst time to take a gap year?,"Obviously none of us can predict the future but I would like to hear some outside opinions on this. 

I am a senior undergrad at a fairly prestigious university (US) and I applied for 7 grad programs (bio, but not health related) this cycle. 

I ended up getting 4 interviews that led to 2 rejections (one explicitly due to NIH funding), and 1 acceptance. The program I’m waiting on I decided I don’t want to attend anyway. 

The problem: the single acceptance I got was to my “safety:” a MS program (I applied to all other PhDs) in a city I don’t want to live in, with a stipend so stupidly low I would have to take out loans for rent. The profs I spoke to there thought the chances of finding a project for me to transition to a PhD are good, but I realized I do not want a PhD from there. This college just isn’t anywhere close to the reputation and connections of my current undergrad. 

On the one hand, I feel like I could do better. I got an interview at a top 10 university, and this one barely makes the top 250. I didn’t apply to several more prestigious schools because of imposter syndrome, and now I regret it. I know rankings aren’t everything, but I feel like I’m worth more than this and their god awful stipend. 

On the other hand, I feel like the chances of getting a job (preferably as a lab tech, I just want to stay in my field) for a gap year are slim to none. I would go crazy living with my parents unemployed for a year, but that’s the likely outcome I’m looking at. It would give me the opportunity to reapply this fall, but I’m terrified things are only going to get worse, and against all the other funding rejects from this year combined with next year’s applicants, I won’t get in anywhere. 

So in my position: would you take the MS acceptance, or brave an unexpected gap year? ",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1jf79ik/advice_needed_is_right_now_the_worst_time_to_take/
iupiqs,The scientific community response to my first thesis chapter has given me the strength I need to continue fighting to stay in research,"I am a hot mess of social anxiety, imposter syndrome and self-doubt after having terrible experiences in graduate school. You name it, it happened to me. Emotional, mental and verbal abuse from a supervisor? Yes. Sexual harassment from faculty and other graduate students? Yes. Sexual discrimination from supervisors because I was female? Yes. 

I isolated myself. I felt defeated. I was convinced that my ideas were not cut out for research. I was convinced that I would finish my PhD and leave the toxic environment behind and work in a commercial/industry lab and hate everyday of my life doing it (I worked in the industry in the past and I couldn't stand it for the short time I was there). In my eyes, I was a loser who just wouldn't make it and shouldn't bother trying. 

But then I published the pre-print of my first thesis chapter and everything changed. While it still has to get through peer-review, the response to my pre-print has overwhelmed me. I sent the DOI to a non-scientific friend a few hours after it went live and my friend replied saying ""That's cool. I didn't know you knew so many people around the world!"".  I was confused what they meant...knowing people around the world? It was just a link to the pre-print. My friend then sent me a screenshot.

I spent 5 years in medical school, I spent nearly a year working. I am reading facts and I am learning facts. I don't know what I did 5 years of medical school.

I was never a terrible student, I was never the best one either. Never failed a major exam, but always just seemed to scrape by in the last few months. I never killed anyone, never gave someone a treatment that I didn't know for sure wouldn't work. I don't understand what concepts are, or what to do with them, what does my brain do with information it learns? 

Sometimes I don't think I have a brain that works, or if I am even here. People seem to be able to relate stuff to each other, and understand how something works. But to me everything just seems like facts floating in space. I can never relate things to anything else.

Am I broken? Is my brain broken? Did I make a mistake picking out a career when I can't seem to understand why something works, just that it does? Have I made a terrible mistake?

A teacher once in school said you had to fake it till you made it, and now med school is over and I'm in real life and I feel like i am still faking it. 

Someone recently asked me how acetaminophen works and I just didn't understand what to say. The facts float in front of me, and I don't know what to say for the fear of fucking up. How can you not know this? A first year med student would know this! 

Why do we give calcium as a supplement?

I am baffled at how little I understand anything at all. Did I have a learning disability that I never understood I had? I was always a normal student at school, did well up to middle school. I remember struggling in physics and some parts of o-chem. I suffer from anxiety and was recently diagnosed to be suffering from moderately severe depression brought on by work. 

But even if it isn't because of my current mental health crises, how do I explain that I struggled in high school concepts of physics as a student? I managed to rote my way thru school and med school? Did i really do that?

I've been clueless since day 1 of medical school and now I sit in the cold stunned fear that I am truly, truly stupid. I imposted my way to this point and when put on the spot and given the time to answer, i truly won't know what to say.

I am truly struggling. Am I the only one who managed to rote memorise their way out of med school?

I have decided to take a break from working for a while because I think I am spiralling into something not too good, and the thoughts of worthlessness have started to settle into me compiling reddit posts.

1lsdffn,Post PhD shenanigans,"Hey All. 

So I've just submitted my thesis in physics (a month or so ago) focusing on computational physics and applied nuclear physics. It felt good for a few days. For the first time in such a long time I felt like a burden had lifted. Life felt good for a few days. Then ...

I was offered a postdoc in a completely different area of research (Data processing in radio astronomy) and yeah I was terrified that I wouldn't be good enough (imposter syndrome strikes again) to do the work. I've looked at the codebase and yeah I'm slowly getting through it but learning something totally new is jarring. 

I had a pretty good time during my PhD if I had to look back on it. Money was tight but that's nothing new. My supervisors were pretty good to me and cared not just about the research but me as a person. I got lucky I guess. The ending bit was a bit of a rush since I got the postdoc offer before I handed in the PhD and the condition of starting was to submit. 

Now I haven't gotten the postdoc contract yet. That's a no for me. I expect to be paid for work that I do from now on. I'm getting pretty sick of just getting by. Went to the weekly meeting and got asked if I was, ""staring at the walls"", and I'll be honest that made me chuckle and then I mostly checked out after that. I don't get it man. I'm supposed to do work with no assurances of pay? I'll leave it to the next meeting to see what happens. 

So I've never really done any work outside of academia. I just made a LinkedIn account and made some other accounts to look for jobs given that I don't know what's happening with the Postdoc position. Overall I think I'm done with academia. My soul will die slowly if I stay. I thought maybe I'd be good in tech? I have some skills like ML, data analysis, visualisation skills etc. I see how bad the job market is right now but maybe not that bad where I am. Man am I screwed? I feel screwed. All I see is leetcode, SQL and a bunch of jobs ads that make me want to crawl into a hole. Anyone got any tips how to escape this hell? I know the usual stuff like in your resume or CV you should frame your research on how it's useful to industry, make a flashy github (I can do this but not overnight), network (Ohh I'm fucked there), practice interviews. Man I just want to take a break but can't really afford to. I can't let myself to be looked after by family. It just feels wrong. I think eventually I'll land something (I don't believe this somehow but also believe it? Weird) after a lot of pain. Never would've guessed feeling like this after submitting my PhD.

o68e02,Sober Post: Things I've learned as an industry engineer,"Inspired by [Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer : ExperiencedDevs (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)

Thought I would jot down everything I've learned through college and over the last \~2 years in the industry.

Background: Top 20 CS program, high school/college internships were a mix of gov't, FAANG, Big N, defense contractors

Full time work: FAANG + Unicorn

&#x200B;

* Getting started:
   * The best time to start is now. some people start in high school, some in college, some when they're 60. Don't compare yourself to others with different backgrounds, just compare yourself to your past self. As long as you're improving and better than yesterday, that's what matters
   * Imposter syndrome is normal - use it to your advantage. thinking your entire team is smart should motivate you to get to that level, not keep you from learning. everyone starts somewhere and soon you'll have people looking up to you too
   * don't do CS for the money unless you have an extremely strong will. this field will burn you out if you do it for money unless you're somehow able to separate the outcome and your day-to-day. i would recommend against it
   * laptop recommendations get asked a lot. I would personally say get a mac product (used or new) made in the last \~1-3 years for simplicity. things will work out of the box and you have unix support from day 1. If you're more adventurous, get a pc and load linux, or get a VM or build a hackintosh. these approaches require a lot of work. Swappa is a good place to find used deals
   * Programming languages don't really matter too much - I would recommend python or java to get started with
   * College is what you make of it - you can go to a low-tier school and do great if you push yourself. You can go to MIT and be a bum. it is easier to do well if you go to a high tier school and push yourself though
   * CS is a learning experience even past college. you'll be learning new technologies, frameworks and having to brush up interview skills continuously. make sure you enjoy learning new things
   * bootcamps vs college is an interesting debate. bootcamps teach the high-level knowledge without in-depth fundamentals. that you have to learn on your own. don't expect just a bootcamp to set you up for success against college grads. you have to put in more work than the minimum. [Would you choose a coding bootcamp or a computer science related degree? Why? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Would-you-choose-a-coding-bootcamp-or-a-computer-science-related-degree-Why) The top answer here is a solid one. Generally, bootcamp grads are extremely rare in FAANG because they want fundamental knowledge. bootcamp grads do very well at small local tech companies that might want something basic without having to worry about scale
* Once you're in college
   * Try new things. go to hackathons, try new clubs, make friends. You learn from those around you and this is an easy way to surround yourself with smart people
   * go to class. as someone that skipped a lot of classes, it's not worth it. you'll spend the same amount of time if not more trying to learn things yourself. the only potential exception is if the classes are recorded and you have enough discipline to watch them
   * GPA matters and it doesn't matter. It matters for government, trading firms, traditional companies (although they'll stop caring once you hit a few years of experience). Normal tech companies don't really care ASSUMING you can show your value in other ways. Having a low GPA and no projects is a bad combo
   * Personal projects are just another way to showcase your skills. it can be substituted with a contribution to open source, part-time work, etc.  It's better to have them than not
   * Core classes to take in college IMO are network security, databases, algorithms, linear algebra, up to calc 2, an advanced data structures class, compilers, OS. you don't need to take the highest level classes but knowing these are good.
   * Have a social life - growing as a software engineer requires soft skills. you can be the smartest person in the room but won't grow unless you're also easy to learn with
   * Be humble and eager to learn. try not to be in an environment where you're the smartest person in the room. Goes back to point 1 where you should get comfortable being uncomfortable and learning
   * Careers fairs are good but do your research. some companies just tell you to apply online, others will give you an interview on the spot. Go first to the ones that will give you an interview and go to the other ones last
   * Hackathons and clubs are a good place to find jobs too
   * [http://angel.co/](http://angel.co/) is a good place to get started on the startup hunt
   * your professors and TA's are there to help you - ask them for help
* Internships/new grad jobs
   * getting the first internship is the biggest hurdle. after that it kind of compounds
   * there's a correlation between the number of applications submitted and job offers. success = attempts x success rate. even if your success rate says the same, applying to twice as many places is good
   * failing interviews is normal. its not a reflection of you as a person or your skillset but your demonstration of that skillset given at the time and situation. learn from it and move on
   * Algorithms and data structures is the core of CS. Do leetcode and get started on these things as soon as possible
   * FAANG has specific programs (FBU, Google engineering practicum, Microsoft explorer) geared towards underrepresented minorities and freshman/sophomores. apply to them
   * [GitHub - j-delaney/easy-application: Over 400 software engineering companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply/) are good places to start
   * Optimize your internships for learning and growth. Learning means trying new things, pushing boundaries etc. Growth means jumping around from company to company. Use a defense contractor to go to Big N and then to FAANG.
   * Learning standard tools like git, docker, etc can make you more effective at internships
   * being young is the best time to take risks. if you want to do a startup over a large company, go for it but do your research. don't turn down google for a company that does IoT socks.
   * information is power. especially when it comes to negotiating. sites like [https://www.teamblind.com/](https://www.teamblind.com/), reddit, and [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) are crucial to make sure you're compensated fairly
   * practice coding on paper/whiteboards. most interviews expect this and will probably be the norm once covid ends
* Industry experience/new grad tips
   * Optimize your first job for (in order) learning, manager, interest in work, compensation. How much they matter should be up to you. ex - don't turn down a 100k job for a 50k job that has a slightly better learning opportunity. but a 90k vs 95k job, optimize on things other than compensation
   * FAANG is overrated and underrated at the same time.  There are plenty of smart people but also plenty of slackers. That being said, the pay and benefits is fantastic. But there are always different and potentially better opportunities. Finance for higher pay and worst wlb, unicorns for higher pay but with more uncertainty, gov't for wlb and low stress. The one thing about FAANG is, there are very few other places in the world where you can work on things at such a large scale
   * silicon valley is a good place to be when you're young, not so much when you're older (unless you're doing really well). living in a house with 3 roommates paying 1500/month is fine in your 20's but paying 2 million for a small house in your 30's with kids is not optimal
   * not all jobs are in silicon valley/est coast but a lot of them are. new york and DC are also top contenders now
   * learn personal finance. ESPECIALLY if you already have internships. Invest as early as you can so you set yourself up for a financially successful life
   * invest in a good setup if you can - ergonomic chair, keyboard, a mouse so you don't have to deal with issues later on
   * dual monitor/ultrawide screens are great for productivity
   * noise-canceling headphones are essential for office work
* General life tips
   * your health is your wealth. eat well, sleep, exercise. money, success, intelligence means nothing if you die early
   * be kind to people - you never know when you'll run into them again
   * take risks when you're young, it'll be harder (not impossible) once you hit 30ish
   * generally have a balanced life. an extreme of anything tends to be bad
   * have a good group of friends - they mean a lot once you get out of college. as time goes on, the opportunities to make new friends come by less often - people go out less often and you don't get the same interaction levels you get in college with clubs and classes. once you're late 20's/early 30's you've pretty much made your core friend group and it becomes harder to break into new friend groups (not impossible though)
   * spend time with family - by now you've spent 90% of the time you will with them so make the last 10% really count
   * money and other things in life are only a part of it. i know people worth tens of millions that barely spend time with family, i know people making a very average income that are happier than people making 300k. everyone has their own issues

I can't really think of anything else at the moment. If you disagree with anything i've said, feel free to ignore or just post a comment so others can see your point of view. i'll respond to comments/dm's when I can.

1lrwivz,Secured PhD funding today but desperate for some advice (Humanities),"So today I got word back from an organisation confirming that my application had been selected for a fully funded PhD and living allowance for the next three years. Obviously, this is good news, but when I saw the acceptance email my heart sort of sank and I'm trying to figure out whether this is just a typical moment of self-doubt before a big life change, or whether this is a telltale sign to reject this offer before I make a big mistake. This might seem like a cut-and-dry query, but I wanted to take on board the experiences from those of you doing research in the Arts and Humanities to get some more relatable insight into PhD life, and see if my trepidation are actually justified.

A bit more detail, of course: I started the application process a couple of months after my Masters course finished in September of last year. It was a bit of a last-minute decision, partly informed by my sudden realisation that the job market for my Masters degree (Translation Studies) was a bit barren in the UK (Scotland). I was (and still am) working a part-time job for a small business which I love dearly - I've been there about six years - but my boss said the balance sheets couldn't justify taking me back on full-time after I'd completed the course. Hence, given I was still in contact with my diss supervisor and he was effusive in his praise of my work, I thought a PhD was the best option. He invited me to a conference in the field (which is a bit too niche to disclose but let's just say, Hispanic Studies), and we cobbled together a fairly strong application to two different awarding bodies.

My Masters had been pretty stressful, riddled with crippling perfectionism and imposter syndrome, but ultimately I loved being back in the academic environment and felt I was putting together some good work (backed by strong grades), so the idea of being paid to do research and expand on some of my ideas was genuinely appealing. But during the intervening 8 or so months, my priorities started to change and I began getting cold feet for a number of very different reasons:

Firstly, my father's health became a matter of concern for our family, and remains so at present. Going back to uni with this long-term uncertainty didn't fully sit right with me, but I also can't stick my life on hold for another year or so until he hopefully gets the all-clear, and nor does he want me to.

Then I began hearing and reading about the precarious state of academia from friends and across several forums, I've started to feel like undertaking a PhD would entail a level of self-sacrifice and borderline exploitation that I'm not sure justifies three years of dedication out of my life.

This has also coincided with a more general apathy towards the project itself - I feel like my passion lies in one aspect of my project, but the emphasis of my application was placed on another. I been reading academic literature, I've read little in relation to my project since I submitted my application, and worry that I'd be grossly underprepared at this stage. I've already told myself that pursuing further roles in academia at the end of it all is a non-starter, so would I just be going through all this just to wind up where I was when I finished my Masters?

I've also reasoned with myself that my priorities at the moment preclude my working in an academic role upon the project's completion, save for the remote possibility of one of the few positions in my field becoming available in my home city. Attending that conference last year made me realise that I maybe lack the sort of hyper-fixation on my project that some other PhD candidates have. I can't see myself forfeiting a weekend to go brown-nosing at a conference when I'd much rather be at the football or with my mates. But then I read of people who do set boundaries during their PhD, and take it on their own terms with a kind of dispassionate professionalism. How feasible is this in reality? Do you need this genuine 'passion' to get you through?

It seems like in typing this out I've kind of resolved my own quandary. But I'm completely aware that this scholarship is an amazing opportunity with the potential to open up many avenues both within academia and beyond. Throwing all of this away to work a minimum wage job (albeit one that I love) would be a foolish capitulation to imposter syndrome. If I'm laying out so many cons, then I'm making this (my first) Reddit post because I *want* to hear some pros!

I'm going to try and speak to my supervisor next week and lay out my situation, but I'm just desperate not to burn any bridges. At the end of the day, he also put some work into this application, and I feel that if I turn this opportunity down then the prospect of returning to a PhD is effectively nil. I wish I had been more transparent about my uncertainty with him at an earlier stage, but maybe I didn't because I subconsciously didn't believe my application would be successful. Either way, however I express my doubts to him, I don't want to come across as somehow uncommitted or disrespectful (even if both those shoes seem to fit...).

Against my instinctive pessimism, I know I could complete a PhD, and I know it would be an extremely rewarding experience that I *think* I want. But I almost want an objective pair of eyes to just make this decision for me - because today's news placed the ball squarely in my court, and I don't know what to do...

I suppose, in short, I just want to know if this profound ambivalence towards my PhD is relatable?",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1lrwivz/secured_phd_funding_today_but_desperate_for_some/
1jvr2hl,I can't get papers accepted to my disciplines main conference. What am I doing wrong?,"I don't know if this is a vent or an advice post; I guess we will find out. 

I just got two papers rejected by the leading conference on my discipline. This is the third year in a row I was rejected, and there were eight total proposals. I have presented and chaired sessions at my subdiscipline's main conference and regional conferences. But I can't seem to crack this main conference. My research is a little bit niche and interdisciplinary (somewhere between queer studies, anthropology, and intellectual history, there are units for all three of those things, but not for all of them together), so it's not always clear what unit to submit to. There hasn't been a call I have read that seems directly related to what I am doing. Still, my advisor told me that that is typical and you just revise your project to fit the parameters. 



I can only submit two papers (or one paper to two units). However, most of the other students in my cohort have presented at least once. Not only is this really disheartening and imposter syndrome triggering, but I'm really worried that without this conference on my CV, I'm doomed. I also can't get funding to go if I am not presenting, and I am worried I am missing out on networking opportunities. 



My advisor has told me that the subdiscipline conference is more important for me, but he still presents or chairs this conference every year. 



So am I doomed, or does anyone have any thoughts about what I am doing wrong or what I could do differently? ",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1jvr2hl/i_cant_get_papers_accepted_to_my_disciplines_main/
1izst1c,What is the most important thing of doing a PhD?,"I got formally accepted to do a PhD earlier this month and I’m starting this October 2025. I’ve begun some early work with my PI as I’m lacking certain skills, especially since I’ve gone from psychology for my bachelor’s to now PhD in engineering. He’s a very kind and responsible PI, and I know that he wants me to be ready when we formally begin my PhD.

I’m nervous and I learnt that imposter syndrome is a thing, but I’m starting to really feel it now even before my formal start date because of my somewhat drastic field change. To the good people of Reddit, do you have any advice or suggestions for me before, during, and after my PhD? Perhaps something that people often overlook?

8x8hmu,Here's a list of stuff that's worked for me in grad school. What's kept you sane?,"I was making a guide for a friend starting grad school, and I thought some of my advice might be useful. I'm going into my fourth year, so I was thinking it might help some people going into their first years now. I'm sure more of it is specific to me and my field than I realize (I lean qual and I don't have a lab). However, I'd love for people to add on and help each other out. A lot of times, grad school is one of those experiences without a handbook, so maybe this will improve someone's well being while here.

General Philosophy:

1. **Trust your capabilities, not your knowledge.** You are a capable person who will get through grad school and do what you need to do. You do not, however, know everything. There is an overwhelming amount of things you will never know. Don’t fret about it. Especially in the beginning of grad school, it is far better to admit what you don’t know than pretend to know it. It’s okay to be wrong, too. Expertise will come naturally. You will suddenly have a huge amount of knowledge on an esoteric topic because you’ve worked to do so. You’ve got this, and will continue to have it. I think this mindset is one of the reasons I’ve avoided the dreaded imposter syndrome (it also really helps that I have good advisors, I don’t care what people think about me, and I’ve faced all lot of adversity). Just because you don’t know how to do something or don’t know something yet doesn’t mean you can’t handle it.
2. **Do not compete.** Everyone comes to grad school with vastly different academic backgrounds, levels of maturity, levels of financial support, and skills. Each person will specialize enough (hopefully?) that you do not have to compete with people in your program. Be genuinely happy for their successes. Share tips on how you got yours. You are not in grad school to win it. (Full disclosure: everyone in my department is fully funded. This may not be the case in places where people compete for funding).
3. **A healthy amount of caring is good.** Your mental health is more important than a course assignment. Your article will never be perfect. Not everyone will like you. If you don’t have a good amount of distance from grad school, you won’t be able to grow. You should work hard and believe in your work, but not be so attached you can’t take criticism, for example. I feel like I don’t care about 15% and this works for me.
4. **Be deliberate.** Each choice in grad school is a strategic one to get a career later. In my case, I go to a ton of professionalization seminars, try to hit two conferences a year, and got a certificate in a related field to try to be open to jobs. Your choices should help you further your career because grad school is a job. It’s okay to mess up, but this mentality will help you later.
5. **Be nice.** Be nice to everyone. You never know who talks to whom. Office staff usually have a lot of intel about grad students. A faculty member you don’t work with might put in a good word. It’s very possible there will be a couple of individuals you don’t like and cannot interact well with (I have two). My advice is to avoid them, and engage politely when need be. When I came to grad school, I had no money and couldn’t afford new clothes until about 6 months in. There were a few people who made rude comments about it. It was entirely unnecessary, and brought me way more stress than I needed. Don’t be that guy.
6. **Create boundaries.** Some people are very strict with this, like only working 9-5 or not checking emails on the weekend. I do this more on the fly by prioritizing stuff I need to do outside of work. This is much easier to do once you’re no longer taking courses, and depends on your boss.
7. **Remember why you’re here.** I think everyone has at least one moment where they wonder if should drop out. My most significant one was my first year. I have dyslexia, and when I had a typo on a draft, a senior faculty told me to drop out because I would never learn how to spell. My mentors talked me out of it. I am here because I like the aspects of what I want to do and think my work is important. 
8. **It’s okay if stuff changes.** It’s totally fine if your interests change. You may not do a dissertation on what you came in to do. It’s okay if your priorities shift. I actually gained a fair amount of weight my first two years of grad school because I was food secure and I sat a lot. I wasn’t worried; a lot of the conditions of graduate school are not permanent.
9. **Be able to explain what you do and why it’s important.** Elevator pitches are really emphasized in my department. One instance on the way back from a conference a border patrol official asked me what I studied, and I was able to answer in one sentence. People want to be interested in your work without hearing everything you’ve ever done. You’ll also be married to a topic for a while at a certain point, so make sure you like it, and make sure you know why other people should care.
10. **If you feel like complaining, channel it.** I don’t like a bunch of the policies at my institution. I also don’t think grad students are treated particularly well. I joined the grad student government and helped advocate directly to officials so I would feel so powerless. That might be an approach that’s specific to me, though. Activism, mentorship, and other avenues might be more appropriate.

Mentorship:

1. **Always ask.** Always ask about opportunities. This can be anything from fellowships to working with faculty to co-authorship to reading a draft. The worst someone can do is say no. This is not a good job for someone who cannot handle rejection.
2. **Have more than one mentor.** Your advisor should be the captain of the ship, but it’s good to have other people to lean on and learn from. You will have to build a committee after all. Plus, advisors are not infallible.
3. **Find mentors that care about you as a person.** This is a best case scenario. You want a mentor that will go to bat for you. You want one who looks out for you and asks how you're doing. My mentors have invited me to holidays and got my mom a doctor. I always came from a low income background, so having mentors help me navigate that was crucial.
4. **Find more advanced students.** Some of them will have very good, specific advice. A lot of them want to pass on their wisdom. Take this with a grain of salt, however. For example, I had a scandal in my department, so everyone who started the program before it had a very different experience than I did.

Time management:

1. **The matrix.** I got this from my advisor, who is good at time management. Sort your tasks into four quadrants like so:

Important and Urgent | Important But Not Urgent
---|---
Urgent But Not Important| Neither Important Nor Urgent

Do box 1 first, and do box 4 last. 2 and 3 are more judgment calls. This stops me from checking my email 400 times instead of actually making a deadline.

2. (not sure why this is showing up as 1, it should be 2). **Use a to-do list.** I use an app called Habitica because I like that it gives me daily and long term goals (also I earn cute digital animals, which is an incentive for me). Some people write them. Mapping out what you actually need to do ensures you know it, even if you don’t want to do it.
3. **Allow yourself to do other things.** Studies show that people who intend to work for hours uninterrupted do not do as well as those who schedule breaks. Have lunch with other grad students. Go to that job talk. The ability to show up is provided you can spare the time, but generally you have more time than you think you do, unless you’re hitting a deadline.

Reading:

1. **Reading is easier than not.** It is easier to have read and know things in a course, for example, than to pretend you know things. If you’re meeting an academic, it’s easier to have read some of their articles than to vaguely know what they’ve done. Reading is a part of your job at this point. That being said...
2. **Don’t read everything closely.** Not everything will be of use to you. Focus on works in your subjects. If you need to skim, read the introductions and conclusions. Read the first and last sentences. Read enough to comprehend.
3. **Sometimes you only have time for an abstract.** As I’ve mentioned before, sometimes there’s just too much knowledge to know. Sometimes you don’t have access to the full article. Sometimes you don’t need to know the methods, just the conclusions.
4. **Pomodoro.** I use the Pomodoro method, which is 25 minutes on and 5 minutes off. This helps me quantify work I’ve done and makes me feel more accomplished. It also ensures I don’t rush the end of pieces. I was messing up my back from sitting for long periods of time, so this forces me to get up periodically.

Writing:

1. **Actually write everything down.** Do you know how many times I’ve had a good idea while I’m in the shower and I think I’ll remember it and then I really don’t? It’s an embarrassing amount of times. You won’t always remember. I remedy this by having a word vomit document for each project.
2. **Write 30 minutes a day.** Some days you won’t make it, and that’s okay. However, most days you can fit that much, and you’ll feel better about days you can fit more.
3. **Track your writing.** It will show you how much your actually working and what work you’ve done that day. It was cool to know my master thesis took 65 hours of dedicated writing (not including data collection and analysis).
4. **Start writing term papers over breaks.** This one is a no-brainer. Breaks are not for relaxing in grad school, or at least not fully. Getting ahead is easier than trying to crank out 15-25 pages (about the normal length in my field) for three classes while grading finals.
5. **Use resources.** There’s no shame in wanting to improve your writing; in fact, it’s part of your job. Looking for help is not a problem. Start a writing group with some friends. Go to the writing center. Read books on style. Get a software like Grammarly. Don’t be embarrassed for trying to grow.

Edit: I'm so glad this blew up! So much good advice in the comments. I feel like helping each other is really what this community's about.

1mh5zzf,Advice please,"Hi all - not in a PhD program but have considered applying for one in cultural anthropology / an STS-focused program and am looking for advice or some hope maybe. 

Basically, after graduating with my BA with an honors thesis related to a topic that I would later get a Fulbright to go and do deeper research on, it’s now been about a year after I returned from my Fulbright and I’ve still struggled to write anything coherent from my research, and am now wondering if I should do it at all. My plan was to apply for a PhD after the completion of my grant. 

I have so many drafts that I’m drowning in them, and now feel so sick of the topic that I keep wanting to give up. I know at my academic level that I’m really missing major skills to do the level of research and writing that I’d like to, and I practically needed more guidance in the research process. But my undergrad thesis advisor told me while on my grant that I should be trying to publish articles, so I got stuck in the mindset that I should be capable of that but am stuck in a loop of imposter syndrome and doubt.

There were a few things that happened during the research experience - I didn’t really have a lot of mentorship from my host affiliate, my project focus kind of shifted while I was there and I suffered from some real imposter syndrome and panic attacks around being asked to be a plenary speaker at a conference, and lost a lot of confidence. For the past year I feel like I’m spinning my wheels trying to write something - even just for grad applications - and am afraid that this whole pathway I thought I’d be able to pursue might be hopeless for me.

i'm 26, it took me 8 years to get through undergrad. i failed out of mechanical engineering and the university twice because of struggles with bipolar disorder, BPD, ADHD, and addiction. because of that my overall gpa is poo and i didn't make a ton of friends or connections in CS and my last chance to do so got rona'd. my cs education has been so spotty and spread out over the years that i just feel like i don't know how to program.

my last semester i stayed clean the whole time and ended up getting a 3.5 gpa in like the hardest classes i've ever taken, but that gave me zero time to grind leetcode or read the crack book. i look at all these 20yr olds that have internships at FAANG companies and feel like i can't compete at all.

tl;dr the imposter syndrome is kicking my ass and i'm starting to worry it's not imposter syndrome and i just suck. i cried after that hackerrank. sorry for rambling, looking for advice or encouragement",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kjkd71/i_am_the_imposter/
1e0k17e,Feeling stupid/like you don’t know enough,"Hi all,

I’m 1 year into the PhD at the moment, and I feel like I know next to nothing. I started my PhD in a top ranked university. I work in a very interdisciplinary field outside of my MSc background. I have a shallow understanding and knowledge in several areas of my research (but nothing detailed). 

Many of my peers know so much, but I feel stupid and like I’m even missing (or forgot over) a lot of fundamental knowledge in my field(s). Imposter syndrome is at an all time high 😓.

It seems like this is a pretty common experience, but does anyone have any tips to address it? On top of that, does anyone have suggestions to learn (and importantly remember more) while juggling research and teaching responsibilities?

nhfbmw,Help me understand this student,"I’ve had a student in three classes now who is hands down the most competent and brilliant student I’ve had in my career but passes in everything so late I can’t fairly give her the grade she deserves.

I don’t know what gives. She has excellent contributions in class, sees things from angles I sometimes haven’t considered, writes the best papers I’ve ever read, clearly works her ass off and loves the material. She could do anything she wanted if she could just hand in her damn work on time.

I’ve tried everything. Positive encouragement. Asking if everything is okay. Warnings about taking points off for lateness. Actually taking points off for lateness. Nothing seems to work. I have never seen a student who is so incredibly competent yet so resistant to success.

I’ve spoken to some of the other professors in the department. They all had great expectations for her and let them go, but I just can’t. Something just isn’t adding up here.

I have been doing self evaluations in my 200+ level classes and adding them in as an extra credit. It’s worked well because on average the students are somewhere from 5-15 points higher than their actual grade, and never lower, not once in the five years I’ve been doing this. I just got to hers - she has because of perpetual lateness a B-, but gave herself a C- for the class. Her reasons were all about the *quality* of her work, and nothing to do with the timeliness of it.

This student actually thinks she hands in straight garbage and is expecting to fail the class.

Part of me wants to redact all the deductions for lateness and give her the grade she deserves strictly on the quality of her work, which would be an A. Just to throw her off and make her think. But I want to better understand what’s happening here before I do that.

Any idea what her deal is? I was thinking imposter syndrome or self sabotage but I’ve seen both before and neither come with a *negative* self eval. Neutral maybe but not negative. She’s so brutal to herself it’s actually a little concerning.

What would you do? Is there anything I can do as her professor to coach her out of this sabotage? She’s going to crash and burn if she doesn’t get out of her own damn way.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/nhfbmw/help_me_understand_this_student/

16bzswb,New professor. Disastrous lecture today,"Just wanting to vent a little bit. 

I’m a new adjunct professor. I completed my masters degree in the spring, and the university asked if I was interested in an adjunct position for this fall. I immediately jumped at this opportunity because I would very much like to teach professionally, and while a PhD is certainly on the table in the future, right now I’m focused on a few different things outside of academia. 

I’ve never taught before, though I consider myself an overall strong public speaker. I enjoy giving presentations and if I can share the knowledge that I have, I’m very anxious to do so. 

Something about today though just felt off. I’m teaching an intro to global affairs course and today’s lecture was on Marxism. I don’t know why but I began getting so tongue tied. I started rambling about really immaterial things and I could tell my students didn’t know what tf I was going on about. I even stopped the lecture at one point to say “what questions do you all have because I know I’m not making sense right now.” It felt so humiliating in that moment to feel like I had lost control over something that should be second nature to me.

Maybe it’s a slight imposter syndrome creeping in? I’ve been out of school for two months and all of a sudden I’m tasked with teaching students who expect me to know everything about this subject - but truth be told I’m feeling super inadequate. I want to do a good job. I want these evaluations to come back with positive feedback and, above all, I want to be asked to teach again. But if I can’t keep my lectures simple, organized, and level-appropriate, I’m screwed. I need to find a way to calm down and remember that I am smart enough, capable enough, and worthy of teaching this class. But after a train wreck of a lecture like I had today, it’s hard to keep that positive mindset. 

Has anyone else experienced a lecture going off the rails? Do you ever find yourself lecturing and then thinking “wtf did I just say? Why are these students looking at me like I’m crazy?” How do you bounce back from that?",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16bzswb/new_professor_disastrous_lecture_today/
pb0pmw,UPDATE: My PI is asking me to hide data,"Hi everyone,

This is an update to my previous post about 6 months ago. [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lks8gb/my\_pi\_is\_asking\_me\_to\_hide\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/lks8gb/my_pi_is_asking_me_to_hide_data/)

My last post didn't get much attention, but I wanted to provide an update for anyone interested. I was miserable in my lab due to my PI's behavior. He is a racist, misogynistic, and generally a toxic individual. He treated me like a slave and expected me to be in the lab 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. He asked me to hide bands from a gel and then tried to gaslight me when I spoke up. In his words, he didn't understand why I was ""going the other way now"" when I never agreed to hide data.

I did take everyone's suggestions to heart, took a leap of faith, and switched labs 5 months ago.

**It was the best decision.**

I've essentially started over in my PhD, but I don't care. My new lab environment is great, I get along well with my labmates, and I don't have to worry about my PI calling me at 11pm for a Zoom call. Although I still struggle with imposter syndrome, I don't feel helpless anymore.

I still can't help but feel a liiiiitttle jaded over the fact that I had to leave behind a nearly finished manuscript. Last I heard, he had removed me as an author and submitted it to a top tier journal, band hidden and all.

1haiimu,Advice For Ph.D. Students feeling imposter syndrome,"
One thing they never tell you and you sort of have to figure it out on your own, is that no single scientist discovers absolute truth. Absolute truth is an order of magnitude greater than any one of us. Instead, our role as researchers is to observe and report. We spend the better part of a decade, taking a wild safari through our experiments and we report what we saw. We make stories about what we think it might mean, but they are ultimately just stories. Data backed stories, but fabrications none the less, meant to connect and interpret data points. These stories get tested by future experiments. We keep the ones that pass every test we (the scientific community, not just one researcher) throw at them, and we throw a lot of stories that fail out. 

A lot of the imposter syndrome I felt when I started came from feeling that I had to meet this unreasonably high bar of closing the book on my research question on answering all the questions with absolute certainty.. to uncover “absolute unshakable truth” but that’s not what science is. You have a research question, you have roughly three smaller scope versions of that question, and you run an experiment for each. Those experiments will never conclusively answer the question at the top, instead you’ll learn that the answer is more complicated than you thought and merits further study. That’s the WHOLE PhD. Absolute truth is an order of magnitude above all of us, so instead aim for data backed stories to tell​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1haiimu/advice_for_phd_students_feeling_imposter_syndrome/

1lonppu,Any advice on where to go from here?,"Hello! I (29F) am graduating with my bachelors in Healthcare Management next summer. I originally thought I wanted to go into an MSHA program, but have been doing a lot of soul searching on what is important to me. Before the pandemic, I worked in the birth field as a birth photographer and enjoyed working in the birth field as I am pretty passionate about women's birth rights, maternal mortality rates, etc. I originally considered midwifery but I have no interest in the clinical side of things. 

I work for a university based hospital and am going on my 4th year with them. My first 3 years were in an access role but I eventually moved up to my position now as an administrative assistant. I am non-clinical and help support 3 (soon to be 5) doctors and 50+ advanced practitioners. My position has been wonderful and I truly enjoy but do not see myself staying in it for the long haul. Seeing what my director has to deal with made me realize I don't think a career at an executive level is something that interests me. 

So that leads me here. I have a passion for advocacy and education. I could talk to a room for hours about statistics on birth outcomes and methods for evidence based practices. I love getting to help support and educate others on their autonomy. I would love to help bring about change in this area. I am also worried about how to do this under the current administration. 

I knew for grad school I would probably need some volunteer work under my belt. I joined a club that focuses on maternal and child health at my school and I have a meeting next week with a local doula/birth education non-profit to discuss volunteer opportunities. 

So I guess I have 2 questions: 

**Where would you go from here?** I feel so lost sometimes. I am a 1st generation college student and did not do well in high school due to unchecked OCD/mental illness, home conditions, and overall bad health. Now I am doing well in college but have a lot of imposter syndrome. 

**And am I competitive?** I have 4 years experience in health care and will be going on 5 by the time I graduate. I have a 3.95 GPA overall and a 4.0 at my current institution.

1kgx7vx,Questioning my passion after meeting with former advisor (advice needed),"Hello everyone! Hope you're having a great spring term. I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I really need some advice about possibly going back to school after just finishing my MA in art history (focus of Ancient Greek sculpture). I would like to eventually shoot for a PhD. During my art history MA program, she advised me that if I wanted to eventually obtain a PhD in our field, I would have to prove a graduate level understanding of both Greek and Latin. She suggested I try to complete another MA, but in Classics. In the meantime, I've been looking into fully-funded MA programs in Classics (super competitive).

I had a meeting with her yesterday that shook me. She continually reiterated that I had to be serious about a PhD program as they are a lot of work and that I can't fall behind like I did in the MA program I just finished (I took 2.5 years years instead of the usual 2 years). I did take some time off from the program for ""personal reasons"" (personal reasons = major imposter syndrome + managing Type 1 Bipolar and PTSD, I never told her this as I believed it to be unprofessional to disclose that information and we didn't have a relationship where I was comfortable telling her my reasons so I just told her I personally needed some time off). She also insisted that I probably didn't enjoy writing and researching my thesis as much as I did because ""it's fun for people who are good at this and enjoy doing this and if it wasn't fun for you, you probably weren't good at it"" (note: managing those personal reasons were a big part of the not-so-fun aspect of writing my thesis). She ended the meeting with saying, ""You're the only one who knows if this is right for you.""

Since then, I've been managing these personal reasons very well (the right meds, therapy, etc.). 

My plan is this: talk to the Director of Graduate Studies for the Classics Department from the university I just graduated from about admissions and creating a strong application. I also plan on taking a Latin course and Greek course this fall term (Catallus and Euripedes) as a non-degree seeking student to prove on my application that I currently know Greek and Latin (I have taken 3 years of Greek and 1.5 years of Latin through different courses and a post-bacc I participated in, but that was before this MA program). I also want to enroll in an MA program where I can incorporate a Digital Humanities aspect in my thesis as I have a minor in that from undergrad and want to use that in my research.

It felt like he regarded me as a mere secretary, assuming I should know every practical procedure without prior explanation. To make matters worse, he even yelled at me once, blaming me for his workload when a patient declined my care due to my ethnic background.

These past weeks have utterly shattered my confidence. Despite making progress in therapy over the last two years to tackle depression and imposter syndrome, encounters like this trigger a relapse into my self-doubt. I've grown more withdrawn, awkward, and afraid of making any missteps in my actions or words.

However, last Friday brought a glimmer of hope. A senior female doctor called me into the OR. I spent three hours holding retractors, enduring back pain in silence. When the procedure ended, it was just her and me at the table. She inquired if I saw myself pursuing surgery, and I admitted my serious doubts about my abilities for that path. Her response struck a chord – she spoke about how everyone attempts to define your limits as a woman in the medical field, and how she's tired of it. She shared her own experiences as a student, revealing her insecurities and how she hesitated to speak up, almost as if she had sensed my feelings these past few weeks. It was surprising, given her strong demeanor within the team.

For once, I left the OR with a smile, feeling a sense of relief, support, and understanding. I'm the first in my family to pursue higher education and become a doctor. Seven years ago, I was a cashier at 'Toys'R'Us' without even a high school degree. The journey to medical school has been overwhelming, and even though I've sought solace in therapy, sometimes life's challenges hit me hard. Yet, it's these small, powerful moments that can make a significant impact. Sometimes, a little support goes a long way.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1625jh5/female_senior_doctor_saving_my_surgery_rotations/

My cohort members are not hyper competitive and they are very honest. Tbh, the months leading up to my PhD program were full of stress. But the stress went away when I spoke to my cohort members. Everyone is so honest about their insecurities, they are humble and they offer extensive support to each other. When I decided to go to a Top 10 program I was afraid my colleagues were going to be aloof. But there isn’t one member that has been rude, hyper competitive or negative. People are so honest about their fears, hopes and weaknesses. I no longer feel alone about suffering from imposter syndrome. 

And my department has gone out of their way to support us in every single way imaginable. They have genuinely worked to address some issues that impact those of us that are POC. Furthermore, I love how that the professors recognize we all have different strengths. We receive so much support.

By far, the upperclassmen are amazing. I have never met some of these people and yet many of them have taken time out of their schedule to recommend classes, offer guidance and listen to the problems we might have.

1iaxgvr,Dealing with imposter syndrome very badly,"Hi everyone,
I know that this is a topic that has probably been discussed a lot on this sub, so please excuse me if I'm beating a dead horse - but I could use some help and suggestions for coping with imposter syndrome. It’s affected me since grad school and I thought it would get better after receiving tenure, but I've actually found that it’s gotten worse. Bad to the point that it is seriously affecting my ability to start projects, work on ongoing projects, design a new class that I have coming up next fall, etc. Lately, I consider just being able to open my laptop and do something feels like a major accomplishment.

I was a high achiever in college and grad school - to the point that I was school valedictorian for both my MA and PhD. But in all of this work, I know for a fact that I did not do my absolute best. I was lazy, I procrastinated, but I have a gift for pulling all my shit together at the last minute and somehow producing work that other people think is really good. But I know what the reality is - if I had really studied more, organized myself better, and wasn’t so lazy about doing things like keeping up to date by reading important journals in my discipline on a regular basis, I would feel much more confident that I actually possess the expertise that my job title (Associate Professor) implies that I do.

Part of my imposter sensibility comes from the fact that (according to others), i am a very attractive and well-spoken woman who apparently puts others at ease. I can’t help but feel that this had a major impact on how my grad school professors assessed me, especially since they were ALL older men. (Some mild sexual harrassment came with the territory.) I know from experience that attractive people get better breaks in life - I've noticed that I myself have to fight the urge to assess conventionally attractive and charismatic students more favorably than those who are not.

Ever since graduation, getting multiple campus interviews, and finally landing a TT job at a flagship state university, I’ve always felt as though I only achieved those things because of the way I look and how I’m able to present myself in public. I had grad student peers who I think we're objectively smarter and more accomplished than I was who did not land jobs for reasons that I think were mainly due to the fact that they didn't “present” themselves as effectively in public. Yes, it’s important that a professor has the ability to hold class attention, and with a background in theater, I'm pretty skilled with that in ways that many of my peers were not. But I have this constant voice in my head that says, “you only got this far because people think you are pretty.” For instance, I won a ridiculously competitive international grant to finish my dissertation and during the interview I observed that the grant committee of four older white European men spent a lot of the interview staring at my body versus actually listening to my interview answers - it was so absurdly comical that it’s a story I've repeated to others. I firmly believe that at least 70% of the reason I was selected was because they liked the way I looked. The number of instances where I feel like I was given a leg up because of my physical appearance are too many to count. And it feels really shitty to think that I have gotten where I am largely due to something completely unrelated to my actual work and intellect.

Then there's the voice that says, “you have just been lucky - the grants I’ve won, the publication opportunities, giving talks at major museums - that all of it somehow just dropped into my lap” because I know I didn't put in the effort and rigor that other students and professors have. I've just somehow managed to hoodwink everyone with my charm and being good at reading people, figuring out what they want to hear, and feeding their egos. I openly admit that I can be psychologically manipulative to get what I want professionally - but I never use these skills in a way that might hurt others or cause harm.

I'm almost 50 now, so the attractiveness factor is definitely on its way out, which feels wonderful!! Now if I achieve something I can’t just chalk it up to the way I look.

At the same time, I’m now also more petrified that I will now be “found out” as a fraud who doesn’t really work as hard as other people or know anywhere near as much as I am supposed to know. I have had an article pretty much ready for submission, but I haven’t been able to submit it for fear of rejection. Why? Because virtually everything I have published has been handed to me via personal networks and requests for contributions to books and special issue journals (all peer reviewed, but I had a leg up to start with). This is the first time I will have ever submitted something “cold” for peer review and I just don’t feel like I measure up. If rejected, it will just confirm all of my suspicions that I truly am an imposter.

So how do I get over this? I’d love any tips for overcoming imposter syndrome. I’m getting desperate. Getting tenure only made me feel like I had now completely hoodwinked everyone and that the game would soon be up. It doesn’t help that many of my department colleagues are viciously competitive, judgmental, and delight in pointing out others’ weaknesses behind their backs. 

Any sign of failure or weakness on my part would be politically awful, especially since we are soon getting a new Dean. These particular individuals will be the ones racing to bend his/her ear with information on anyone who they see as “underperforming” in order to raise their own status to get perks like plumb committee assignments and freebie course releases. I don’t play that way and try to keep a low profile because of my imposter anxiety and I know it’s holding me back professionally, not to mention what it’s doing to my mental health.

Apologies for the extremely long post and lack of paragraph breaks - Reddit isn’t letting me edit text that I’ve already written. Any morsels of insight or help would be greatly appreciated, especially from anyone who has felt like they got unfair advantages due to their physical appearance. That aspect of it definitely feels the worst - I feel as though I’ve taken things that others deserve because of the way I looked. 

Please don’t think that I’m saying, “Poor little me, just because I was once a model, I got this great job but my life has been so rough!” I’m not like that at all - I think the fact that physical appearance confers unfair advantages is an awful thing. Feeling like an imposter because of it is deeply disturbing at many levels.",Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1iaxgvr/dealing_with_imposter_syndrome_very_badly/
74lqf1,"Reflections of Someone with More Than Three ""Red Flags"" on Her Application","I had numerous shortcomings in medical school. I was clearly not the ideal applicant. I did everything to increase my chances of getting into residency: worked hard my third year, emphasized my strengths in my application, and applied broadly. I applied somewhere between 120-150 family medicine programs, ended up with 21 interview offers, and went on 17. I matched to my #4 program.

How I got my ""red flags"":

* I failed my cardiology module after developing anxiety in my first semester of medical school. I could not cope with my failure and fell into depression. I chose to stay in denial about my situation. I refused all help.
* I missed Step 1 by one point. This was my breaking point. Eventually, I sought treatment and asked for extra help in school. My grades improved during MS3. I recovered enough of my knowledge deficits to perform slightly below average on Step 2. 
* I passed my Step 1 retake by only *one* point. I did not have significant improvement compared to my first score.
* I postponed graduation by one year while I figured out personal and family issues.

If anyone suffered from imposter syndrome, it's definitely me. I constantly wondered why any residency program even considered me for an interview. I realized on interviews that programs want residents who persevere. This is even more of a reality as my program director and attendings review applications right now. They constantly remind us that applicants who are familiar with adversity are preferred over ones who had it easy their whole life. My advice is this: do not shy away from your shortcomings or ""red flags."" Take responsibility, and explain how you changed for the better.

I am writing this because it is important for people who struggled to speak up. I strongly believe speaking up is one way to better the culture of medicine so others will not feel isolated. We are all imperfect people, and we all have our limitations. It is important to recognize those limitations, and to figure out how to overcome them.

I am currently a PGY-1 in a family medicine residency. None of my co-interns know about my past. When I am rotating through an off-service rotation, none of the attendings care about my Step scores. What matters now is the quality of my work and my willingness to work. First year of residency is tough. It is certainly harder than medical school. On the bad days, I recall the worst day of my life and remind myself - if I can get through that, then I can overcome anything.",medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/74lqf1/reflections_of_someone_with_more_than_three_red/
1kb12es,Motivation for a 3rd year burnt-out student,"Hello, 

I am currently two months away from my preliminary candidacy exams and approximately 1 - 1.5 years  from graduation. I have a supporting supervisor who believes in me and a decent research topic. 

The issue is…. I am completely exhausted. I’ve had to push myself HARD both mentally and physically to get to this point and my discipline, persistence, and stamina are fading away like water slipping through my fingers. 

I’ve never been the smartest dude in the room but I’ve always managed to make up for it with grit, early mornings,  and late nights which unfortunately have taken their toll on my mental and physical health. In the last weeks I’ve found myself producing mediocre work and struggling to get stuff done. Tasks that seemed easy during my M.S. degree years ago seem like a Goliath these days. 

I also don’t think I have the stamina to prepare for my preliminary exams ( I have two months) which has me worried and I am scared to fail. 

Additionally, I am experiencing symptoms of imposter syndrome, which are destroying my self-confidence. 

A lot of the things I want are on the other side of this program, and I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP. I have invested 9 years of my life to get to this point. 

Is getting a PhD supposed to feel like this - dragging your exhausted body to the finish line? 

Are these things I am experiencing normal at the end of a PhD? 

How did y’all manage to push through in similar conditions?  

And above all…

Was it worth it?

lsob16,I made a new friend in grad school!,"Just wanted to share something that made my day. I’m a first year PhD student and like many on this subreddit I’ve been encountering the struggles of classes and research in an entirely online space, trying to find a work/life balance, and dealing with imposter syndrome and trying to feel like I belong at a top-tier research university that just doesn’t feel like home yet. 

This semester I’m taking a class that has undergrads in it, and this super bright sophomore who is taking this upper level class reached out to me to ask some questions about a project. I met up with him on zoom, helped him with his questions, and then we ended up chatting for an hour, just talking about hobbies, where we grew up, and campus things that I didn’t know yet since it’s my first year. I feel like haven’t made a new friend in over a year since I graduated undergrad, and it was amazing just getting to connect with someone in a deeper way. At the end of our talk, he told me “You’re really cool.” And that just made my day. 

Even if there are moments where you’re insecure about your accomplishments, whether you belong, or your work, don’t forget that the lens inward is always way more critical, and you’re probably admired and respected for where you’re at right now. And even outside of school your personality and interests are important to hold onto in your identity. If you need the reminder today, you’re really cool.

Edit: thank you for the awards! Grad school and particularly online grad school is tough, but best of luck to all you cool people.

1jkwmjr,How To Stop Being Embarrassed By Critique,"I’m currently preparing a presentation for a symposium, and I was super excited to hear that it’s a finalist in the running for awards. I went over my topic with a professor, and he gave me a lot of constructive critique on how I can improve. 

Now, I’ve always been a bit sensitive, but I can’t shake this feeling of embarrassment. I feel like 1) I presented a faulty product to someone whom I really respect and now they may think less of me and 2) I’ve invested way too much stock into what this professor thinks of me, and it’s embarrassing to realize that. I’m known by professors and students in my department as the “smart writer person”, and I almost feel like I’m betraying them if I don’t keep up that persona. Imposter syndrome sucks, but now it’s mixed with this terrible feeling of shame. It’s as if I humiliated myself in front of someone I look up to, and I feel embarrassed that I wasn’t able to present the “perfect” product.

Does anyone have any advice for how to deal with these feelings? Writing out everything has definitely helped, and acknowledging that I’m only embarrassed puts everything into perspective as being pretty minor. Finding value in my work without outside validation has always been a struggle, and im trying to figure out good ways to deal with it. I’m grateful that I’m dealing with this now because processing feedback is always a good skill to practice, but it still feels hard.

I'm a junior Computer Science student who transferred after completing one year at a local community college. I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.

Last fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.

As a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.

1hda3np,Please help: Don´t know how to communicate an authorship conflict with ex-supervisors,"Hi dear community,

I need your advice on a matter I´m dealing with regarding authorship of a publication from my PhD - it´s a long story but I´ll try to keep it as short as possible. I feel like I´ve been wronged and I´m surprised at how difficult I´m finding it to speak up for myself so I need your guidance to see if my perspective is too harsh, too soft, or in the goldilocks zone of conflict mediation. I graduated from my PhD (marine biology - country is Ireland) last year and had a pretty tough time during it, especially with imposter syndrome. I´ve now moved onto a great job in a great institute in Portugal with a slightly different speciality but still marine science and am enjoying employed life in academia, however, this incident is throwing up a lot of old feelings and I don´t have the colleagues to turn to for support.

Here´s a breakdown of what happened:

\- The final chapter of my PhD is a paper based on two years of field trial experiments I conducted with the supervision of my three supervisors and co-authors. We submitted the paper to a journal when I was graduating and it came back with major revisions (some grammatical stuff, some statistical reanalysis). I was first author because I did all the work, analysis, and writing, there was never a question about authorship. We decided not to resubmit straight away as I was busy graduating and seeking employment.

\- A year later and my more immediate supervisor wrote to me to ask about resubmission to another journal. I agreed but was very busy so admitted I was happy to do the minor edits but didn´t have the time to do a full re-analysis of the stats but suggested sharing the workload to which they agreed (two supervisors in the email, the one directly above me and the more ""auxillary"" guy, they excluded the PI from the conversation who is very high up in the university and heads the whole STEM dept.

\- I shared the manuscript with them, clearly stating that I was happy to continue working on it together and had made time to revise in the coming weeks after their revisions. Two months later I receive an email from her with the all authors in CC celebrating that it has been submitted to another journal and is now in pre-print. I view it to find out that I was removed as first author, the statistical revisions were never made, and only grammatical changes were done. I was never given the chance to approve before resubmission.

I am pissed about this but have been so conflict avoidant that I haven´t said anything but now it is bothering me too much and I need to address it. Eventually I got around to drafting this email but would love some outside perspective on how this might come across?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear X,Y, and Z,

Greetings, I hope this email finds you well.

I was quite shocked to receive your email informing me that you had submitted the field trials paper and it has taken me some time to process this and figure out the appropriate response. I would like to give you the opportunity to share your perspective on the matter and I have a few questions to which I would appreciate your honesty. Hopefully we can find identify a cooperative and productive next step.

The primary questions I have at this time are:

\-          At the time of submission, did you indicate to the journal that all authors had reviewed the final draft and given permission for the manuscript to be submitted?

\-          Was there a unanimous decision reached by all co-authors to not allow me the opportunity to review the paper before it was submitted?

\-          Can you please outline the decision process behind removing me as primary author and how the changes to the manuscript are reflected in the updated CRediT statement submitted with the manuscript?  

Below is my perspective on the conversation we shared over email in May of this year which I have spent time re-examining. If you have interpreted the conversation differently, please share your perspective on the same.

When we last spoke about re-submitting the paper, I made it clear that I was happy to continue working on it together, and would make the grammatical and bibliographic changes recommended by the original reviewers. I informed you that I did not have the time at that moment to re-do the statistical analyses suggested but was happy to consider alternative journals which we could submit to. When I shared with you my version of the manuscript, I said I was open to discussing the reviewer comments and indicated that I had scheduled time over the summer to revise after you had made your revisions. At no point did we discuss a change in authorship, and at no point did we discuss submitting the paper in the state it currently exists. I indicated I was looking forward to re-submitting and had been researching journal options. The next email I received from you was when you told me the it had been resubmitted to ""Journal B"" and is under pre-print.

As I see it, this paper reports on the experiments which I conducted over two years of my PhD. With your guidance and supervision, I conducted the field trials which entailed the following: researching and collating the literature, designing the structures used for applying different treatments, collecting specimens in various locations around ""the country"", liaising with the producers, relaying and securing them on the study site, selecting materials, testing, and building the  frames, carrying out the field- and lab-based sampling at every sampling period over the two summers, carried out the dissections, and the molecular analysis, histopathology, and other lab work. I curated and analysed the environmental data, carried out all of the formal analysis, produced all of the graphical elements and of course wrote the original draft and subsequent editions following your helpful revisions and comments. Clearly this was an effort worthy of primary author when we initially submitted the manuscript to ""Journal A"" as per the agreed upon author contributions copied below.

The changes to the manuscript submitted to ""Journal B"" include: grammatical adjustments in a number of sentences, five new sentences added to the methodology section, three new sentences to the discussion, some minor bibliographic changes, and the map pinpointing the study site was slightly adjusted. The statistical reanalyses were not completed and many of the issues highlighted by the original reviewers were not addressed. I hope you can understand my concerns around these changes and my confusion as to how they are reflected in the new author contributions.

I would like to make it very clear here that I do not in any form whatsoever undervalue or underappreciate your supervision, guidance, advice, and assistance throughout these experiments, and your expertise played a vital role in producing a worthy piece of research, in particular for the conceptualization, experiment design, reviewing and editing, and funding acquisition. I have always been and still am very grateful for the support and training I received while conducting my PhD research.

If it is the case that you all believed my contributions to this research are not worthy of primary author, this is a conversation you should have had with me. The problem arose when you made the decision not to discuss the change of authorship with me, not discuss the revisions to the manuscript, and not allow me an opportunity to review before submission or to resubmit. We are all members of the scientific community and abide by common codes of research ethics and academic integrity. Both ""University"" and the  ""Journal B"" have specific policies and guidelines around authorship handling and the types of practices which are considered misconduct.

It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this situation and I sincerely hope we can come to some resolution. I wanted to first express my concerns and share my questions above, and offer you the opportunity to share your side of the story before bringing it any further. It would be great if we can discuss our options and find an amicable way forward.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I´m sorry for such a long post, and I don´t expect you to read it all but just trying to give the full information.

What would you do in this situation? Is the drafted letter/email way too long and overthought? Am I within appropriate response territory or blowing it out of proportion?

FWIW, I would assume the PI and maybe even the auxillary co-author were not aware of the submitting supervisors actions, I feel like she may have ""believed"" or told them I was no longer interested in submitting and took it over. I know I may be lighting a fire by mentioning misconduct but it annoys me greatly that there is a paper in pre-print which I worked my ass off for two years on and did literally all of the groundwork (with their supervision and revisions etc) which now has her name as primary author, especially when it is already published as the final chapter of my phd with me as first author and there was no doubt about me being first author on the first submission.

I knew this was a possibility, but I don't know what comes next. I'm so tired and if the answer is ""work toward full"" I think I'll vomit. **But how do I reorient my life now?**

On my first rotation of third year rn (peds) and I'm starting OB next week. I feel like I say stupid things and am frequently wrong, and there is some good evidence to back that feeling up. These are obviously bad qualities for a physician to have, and I know I have to work on it, but on top of everything it's overwhelming.

I have such a sinking feeling about all the evals I haven't gotten back yet, and the shelf exam is scaring me. Also, the hours for OB are bonkers at my school, and according to M4s I've talked to the residents are decidedly not friendly. On top of that my fiance and I have both been busy with really poorly overlapping schedules, so that's isolating.

Basically, I feel like a child about to go into the ring for a bare knuckles boxing match with Mike Tyson (in his prime not from the Jake Paul fight), and there's no way to get out of it.

1hmxs7h,"Freaking out, man","I start school at a relatively high up tier 1 school in January. It’s for a degree relevant to my current career. I was pumped about it and very surprised I got in. Cue imposter syndrome that only got worse when I went to our company leadership to sign off on tuition assistance, and he questioned my commitment because I bartered salary for a flexible work schedule. (I’m a full time working mom whose work has won multiple awards and much praise this year.)

Anyway since then I’ve been incredibly anxious. He signed the paper, but now I’m scared of the golden handcuffs, especially when his comment was so off putting I barely want to work for him anymore (the value system of my workplace has changed a ton under his new leadership this year and doesn’t really align with mine anymore). I’m also now worried about tuition and if this is even the degree I want or if it’s just dictated by my 13 years in my field. I don’t even know if it’s applicable to other careers and I’m worrying so much about it.

Honestly I think my confidence is just shot. What to do? Is this a midlife crisis dictated by one asshole or is it something valid? Any insight would be appreciated.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1hmxs7h/freaking_out_man/

vyhmub,"I defended my PhD thesis yesterday, and here's what I learned about dealing with a toxic PI for five years.","Yesterday, I defended my PhD thesis and thankfully passed. My PI shook my hand which was a weird feeling because I don't think we've ever had any physical contact in our time together. He also said ""Well deserved congratulations"" which also really weirded me out because I don't think he's ever said anything that positive to me before. I'm still kind of resentful he didn't even want to introduce me to the audience before my defense.

My PhD was a long arduous journey, to say the least. I was lucky to be funded by three fellowships, but I was unlucky with an extremely difficult project with very low quality material that only started to work in the middle of my final year. The very worst part was having to deal with a toxic, narcissistic PI who is a terrible mentor. I have PTSD and imposter syndrome, and I had suicidal ideation 2-3 times in my five years of PhD, just from my advisor's relentlessly toxic and unpredictable behaviors. It got to a point where I was hysterically crying in my bed, forcing myself to make a list of things I wanted to do before I killed myself just to remember there was life was worth living. PhD can make you think you're a bad researcher, but having a toxic advisor can make you think that you're a worthless human being.

Here is a list of all the things I learned about dealing with him. Hopefully they help some people, though I understand there are much more horrible circumstances.

* **Go to therapy.** Hopefully, your university has a decent mental health program where you can see a therapist on campus or externally. Most likely, you did pretty well in high school and in undergrad and  Master's institutions. But a PhD is just multiple years of failure upon failure which is especially worse with a terrible PI, and for someone who's used to successes and weekly/monthly validations, it is extremely debilitating on your psyche. Seeing someone professionally about that might help. My therapist also went through a PhD and many of his patients are/were PhD students, so he had a lot of useful stuff for me.
* **Disassociation.** Chances are, they're an asshole to most people in the group. I learned this from someone on Reddit, and they said anytime their PI would go off on them for the dumbest things (e.g., shitting on their analysis which they heartily approved the week before), they would constantly think in their head ""There they go, they're doing that thing, that thing they do to every single person in this lab, they're doing that thing"" over and over until their PI is done being an asshole. Also record what they're saying so you can go over what they actually said later in case they said something that you needed to do.
* **Have everything on record.** Send them emails right after meetings to record exactly what was discussed during the meeting and what is expected for the next meeting. These emails could be framed as ""I understand you're a very busy person, and this is just to remind you what we've discussed before."" This is especially important if they said they would pay for something and then later refuse to reimburse you since they ""don't remember telling you"" that they'd pay for it.
* **Try to find a co-advisor/mentor.** I ended up relying a great labmate a few years above me, who understood how shitty my PI could be. But in the US, there are also federal programs that allow you to do research at a national lab where you could find a really nice mentor for the remainder of your PhD. You could also try to find some nicer collaborating scientists/professors to guide you through some issues with your project.
* For me, a PhD was 5% how to do research and 95% emotionally getting through lots of failure before coming across some result. Emotionally getting through something includes: ranting about your research/PI with your labmates (cathartic, honestly), therapy, and getting really into a hobby or sport that lets you express your emotions safely. For me, it was martial arts. And let me tell y'all, after a whole day of failures in lab and/or your PI being an asshole, having a place where it's socially acceptable to kick and scream is so great.
* As long as you stick it out, they have to give you a PhD at some point. This is one of the things I told myself in the darkest parts of my PhD. As long as you keep coming back to work, to meetings, analyzing data, etc., they have to graduate you. If they don't graduate you, it'll look very bad on your PI, and it'll look very bad on your university.
* Your PI likely has a huge ego. There's no way that your PI would let you invite all your friends and family to a public thesis defense and then let you fail. It would look very bad on them, which is all they care about.
* While looking for a prospective PI, DO NOT talk to 1st-3rd years. **Seek out 4th, 5th, 6th, and alumni for their impression of him. ESPECIALLY alumni because their degree is no longer held under hostage by the PI.** If a 4th year talks shit about their PI to a prospective student and it gets back to the PI, the PI can easily make the 4th year's life a living hell. All of the current students are basically trapped into saying great things about their PI.
* ~~I actually think the best way to find a great PhD advisor would be to ask each prospective PI about their own PhD experiences. And then~~ **~~choose the PI who had the worst PhD experience~~** ~~because they're way more likely to set boundaries (e.g., no Friday 11pm meetings, no expectations for you to work holidays) and know what a mentor is supposed to do and actually do those things (e.g., be understanding when shit goes wrong and go into crisis mode WITH you to figure out what to do next instead of getting mad that you messed up, find collaborators and actually attend meetings with you and the collaborator).~~ Edit: Sorry, this isn't a foolproof method because some profs will think because they went through a shit experience that their students also have to go through a shit experience. Instead, find a PI who sets boundaries and knows what a mentor is supposed to do. Ask the alumni and current lab members what time they go home, when do they work, what happens when something goes wrong, do they work on holidays, does the PI set boundaries, what is the PI's mentoring style, what is the PI's communication style, what is the worst that the PI has ever done to students. If there's drama between lab members that the PI didn't bother solving, stay away. If a PI is rude or harsh during a group meeting, run.
* If you're in your second-to-final or final year, I would say stick it out. **But if you've only been there for 1-2 years and you're already miserable, just leave.** It's seriously not worth the destruction on your mental health for 3+ years.  You could try to find a different advisor, program, or university. Or you could just leave academia. Seriously. PhD is basically a MLM scheme with no oversight.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/vyhmub/i_defended_my_phd_thesis_yesterday_and_heres_what/

1ki2dq2,Not feeling supported in my counseling program,"I just wrapped up my first year in grad school as a clinical counseling major. Im struggling with imposter syndrome and feeling unsupported by professors and advisors In my program. Last semester I had a professor make fun of me in front of class during a roleplay because I was leaning forward. My professor told me that leaning forward could make someone uncomfortable. As well as then telling the class that she would never personally see a male therapist. In my other class I had to write a paper on a journal article that discussed a specific mental health condition. My professor misinterpreted what I had wrote in my paper and became upset with me. He accused me of saying people with a specific mental health condition never experienced trauma. Which is not what I wrote. When I told him that wasn't what I wrote she said I was still wrong and I should have wrote it better then. He also told me that having a full time job on top of grad school is almost impossible to manage and succeed in. 
This past semester I had another professor who doesn't communicate at all about what he wants in papers and is very strict on APA and grammar. He also gives incorrect information about APA and refuses to acknowledge when he is wrong. I had another professor who was teaching one my online classes but she never and never taught the class. She uploaded PowerPoints from the book publisher. Told us what our assignments were and that was it. She never gave feedback on discussion boards and papers. When I tell my advisor who is also a professor in the program, he told me that their is nothing he can do. He told me to complain to fill out the course evaluation form and put the issues I had with each class In them. I don't feel like I am being set up for success In this program.

1kn7b6l,Comps have me feeling down and inadequate,"Hey fellow PhD students,

Writing this before I get another day of my comprehensive exam journey started. In my department, comps are divided over 3 fields (2 minor, 1 major) where we have to write one exam per field/committee member. We get 72 hours to write each exam. They take the form of a paper where you either answer one question in about 20-25 pages or two questions in about 10-15 pages each. The total is always somewhere around 25 ish pages per exam, maybe closer to 30 for your major but it depends on what your field supervisors ask.

I’m about to wrap up my second paper which is due tomorrow morning and I’m just really struggling with (you guessed it!) imposter syndrome. I’ve been preparing for these exams for 2 years basically, with some breaks in between fields. I have the most amazing committee members, including an incredibly supportive cheerleader of a supervisor who I’ve been working with since my MA. I think what’s getting me down is feeling like I’m not answering the questions “right” despite objectively knowing my stuff and also knowing I’m really just being tested on what I do know.

This second exam in particular is tripping me up because it’s being given by the committee member who I’ve had the least contact and meeting time with throughout the reading process, even though I’ve taken a grad-level course with them in the past and they know my work very well. They’ve also always been very encouraging.

I’ve heard it before from both folks on this sub and from the mouths of my committee members themselves that they don’t want me to fail and are looking for reasons to pass me. And I know my committee isn’t there to have a “gotcha” moment and are eager for my oral exam next month. I just can’t shake the feeling that somehow I’ll let them down or won’t meet their expectations. I know I won’t do my best work in 72 hours, especially under these circumstances, but man this process is brutal on the self-esteem.

I guess I’m just looking for words of wisdom from folks who have been through the comps process and come out on the other side alive. Very grateful for this sub!",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1kn7b6l/comps_have_me_feeling_down_and_inadequate/

Pride in myself for getting into a program and (so far) actually doing pretty well has been diminished since I started. For example, recently I told my friend about imposter syndrome, its prevalence in academia and that it has also affected me, and he told me that I was bragging about holding a position important enough to warrant imposter syndrome in the first place. I also get the classic 'perpetual student', 'doesn't work in the real world', 'not a real doctor' from a lot of people. I've even had 'not worked a day in his life' from my Gran (I've had several 'real' jobs). I'm the first/only person in my immediate family to pass GCSEs, let alone get a degree, so I understand that there must be apprehension/jealousy or whatever, but I also think that adults should control their emotions a bit better.

And maybe a more specific case here, but my girlfriend (a veterinarian) straight up thinks what I do must be easy or not real work because I often work from home on my PC. I can't even explain my work to her because she only has a very basic understanding of the fundamental concepts in the first place, and either won't listen or will get frustrated (despite this rant I do love her very much and we get along 99% of the time).

1j7032r,My Master's degree completely broke me,"**Hey everyone,**

I'm at a dead end and don't know what to do. I graduated in the summer of 2024 with a degree in Japanese linguistics. Earning my bachelor's was already stressful enough, but I wanted to complete it and have a degree—partly due to pressure from my family. After graduating, I applied for a Master's in Japanese Language and Culture, which is the continuation of my program at the same university. I didn’t have the time or energy to explore other options or prepare for entrance exams in a different field, so I just went with it.

I started my Master's in September 2024, and I hate it. I've realized that this field is not something I want to pursue in the future, and I regret choosing it as my career path. I know changing or switching majors isn’t a big deal, but I’m unsure whether I should drop out now or just push through and finish it. I’m still in my first year and have one more to go, but I honestly don’t think I can do it anymore. I feel completely drained, I have no motivation for anything related to this degree, and my mental health has taken a turn for the worse.

I was considering finishing it and then applying for another Master’s in a different field (I'm more interested in marketing, media, and PR). On top of that, I’m supposed to go to Japan for a year-long exchange starting this September, which would replace my second year of study in my home country. I know this could be a great opportunity, but I’m afraid that my attitude toward the degree and my studies won’t change, even in Japan.

At this point, I’m sure I don’t want to pursue a career in this field, and finishing this degree feels like a waste of time. But at the same time, I keep telling myself to just push through and get it done. I’m 25 now, and if I decide to finish this degree, I’d have to work while studying for another one, which I hope would be manageable.

I want to do well. I want to get back to being that disciplined, driven version of myself. But I feel like for some reason I can’t, and my drive to excel is gone.

It’s honestly scary and depressing to feel this way, because I know how important this stage is for my future, but I feel like I’m running on empty and just going through the motions, despite being on a relatively easy rotation right now.

For anyone who’s been here before, how did you climb out of this? How did you find motivation again when you felt completely drained and apathetic?

1jywbyv,"Grades aren’t everything, and I learned that too late","I'm a third-year CSE student, well almost done with my 6th semester. I should’ve landed a summer internship by now, but that didn’t happen (yet, at least). I’m not from a top-tier or shiny university either.  

Growing up, I was conditioned to believe that if you just study what’s taught in class, get good grades, you’ll be fine. I carried that same mindset into college and stuck to it until reality hit me, way later than it should have.  

By my third semester, I finally realized that only focusing on academics wasn’t going to get me anywhere. I started looking into development, but then got hit with some health issues. I was in physical therapy for the third semester, from 7 to 10 AM daily. Then a quick breakfast, and straight into classes until 6 in the evening. That routine left me completely drained, both physically and mentally and the therapy itself was very taxing on me. So I chose to prioritise academics (DSA still kicked my ass though and my gpa fell), and put development on the side.

Fourth semester was a repeat, trying to recover gpa. During the following summer, I honestly just wanted a break ,continued therapy, went on a trip, didn’t do much else. No regrets, but yeah, I didn’t use the time productively (wasted two solid months) .

Then the internship rush started. I realized how behind I was, panicked, and rushed into learning React and doing some random ML projects that, looking back, aren't really impressive. I’ve been trying to catch up since then. But the competition is tough, and my projects look like baby steps compared to folks who’ve been building cool stuff since their first year.

My academic performance is solid, and I have a strong command of core subjects. But it’s painfully clear now that a high gpa alone doesn’t get you anywhere in engineering if you don’t have the skills to back it. I wish I had reached out to profs for research work, but I was (and still kind of am) socially awkward and clueless about networking.

My parents are pushing for a Master’s, but I’m not really into that idea. I want to work. I know I’ll get a job eventually, probably not a great one, but something to get me started. Still, I feel like I’m always running after a train that’s long left the station. It's like my hard work is always in the wrong fcking direction and I always realise too late.

Just felt super lost and hopeless today after a rejection mail (hey , atleast they cared to reply lmao), so yeah, I decided to rant here. Thanks if you’ve read this far. Any advice or direction would mean a lot. Especially if you’ve been in a similar boat.

*TL;DR*

Grew up thinking good grades were all that mattered, carried that into college, ignored dev and networking. Health issues messed up a year. Now I’m playing catch-up with React/ML while everyone else seems way ahead. Got rejected again today, feeling super lost. Just needed to let it out, any advice would really help

*Edit :*

Since a lot of people are misunderstanding this as a narrative on grades don't matter, I never said they do not. Good grades definitely help, but without the development experience and good projects, it's useless, at least it has been for me. 

My current gpa is just overkill, I could've gotten by with sth lower, and should've dedicated more time to skilling up. At the same time I have seen some of my friends struggle coz they have backlogs on certain core papers despite really good dev skill.

What's needed is to set a balance, to not completely tank your gpa but at the same time work on gaining skills relevant to real world projects. ",csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1jywbyv/grades_arent_everything_and_i_learned_that_too/
1i1j7yg,Have you ever been stuck on a paper? How did you push through?,"Hi everyone,

I am a third-year PhD student, and I am really struggling with my first paper. It’s a systematic literature review that I’ve been working on for two years. After multiple rounds of feedback, it finally got rejected, and I’m feeling completely drained. Every time I revise it, I find more papers to include, and I’ve gone through this process three times now. I’m trying one last time to get it done, but it’s hard to stay motivated.

I wanted to ask if any of you ever been stuck on a paper for a long time? How did you overcome it? What helped you finally finish and move forward?

I could really use some stories and advice to remind myself that this is still possible. My other two papers are in the process of publication. It's just this paper which I hate the most.

1igw18x,"Drained, Depressed, Dog-tired and Demotivated. Please no negativity or harmful comments. I am struggling mentally.","Just defended my qualifying exams, but I feel completely drained. Where do I go from here? I’m a third-year PhD student, and I just passed my qualifying exams (with minor revisions). I should feel relieved, maybe even proud—but instead, I feel exhausted, bitter, and completely lost.

Grad school has been brutal, and not just in the ""science is hard"" kind of way. The institution I’m in has taken a serious toll on me mentally, and right now, I’m sick in bed, trying to hold on with some glimmer of hope. I do not know if I should stay tough it out, drop and master out, or take a semester off to think.

At the start, I was genuinely excited about my research. I saw so many biological connections in my project, and it reignited my passion for science. My PI hadn’t had a PhD student in over a year, so I took the initiative—reading dozens of papers, brainstorming ways to expand our work, and even mapping out techniques and costs. When I brought my ideas to him, he shut them down completely. Not only did he reject everything, but he told me to stop thinking about biology altogether. That crushed me. I had spent so much time building a deeper understanding of our work and coming up with ways to enhance it, only to be dismissed like my ideas didn’t matter.  A ""friend"" (who isn’t really a friend anymore) told me I should just accept it, saying maybe it was a funding issue or that my PI needed to focus on his current grant. So, I swallowed my excitement and moved on. It stung like hell. Like salt to a wound.

Then, things got worse. A master’s student joined the lab, and at first, we were close. But by May, everything turned toxic. Out of nowhere, she started verbally harassing me—yelling at me, cursing me out in the lab office for no reason. It wasn’t a one-time thing either. It happened multiple times. I brought it up with my PI, and his response? ""She was probably just having a bad day. She was raised differently than you."" He refused to address it and said it was on me to fix the situation. She did it again. Several times throughout the summer and fall semesters. Screaming and cursing at me, calling me hostile, and somehow convincing my PI to take her side. When I got the department involved (GAR and chairperson), nothing really changed. She backed off, but all that came of it was my PI posting a weak ""respect each other"" note on the lab door.

On top I want to mention that this PI is a 50-year-old man who has made my experience here a nightmare. It’s not just that he rejects my ideas—he actively insults me in front of the entire lab.

During group meetings, he constantly compares me to his undergraduate students and undermining me saying things like:

""X (senior) can explain this topic to you since you do not know this.""-He flirts with this girl constantly.

""You are not passionate in your work.""-I spend 12 hours a day in lab and I even came in on the weekends and Sundays after church.

""Why did you take molecular spectroscopy? That is a useless course""-mind you my work and theory deals with all of that and he recommended me to take a course that has no bearing on my current work.

It’s humiliating. I’m a PhD student, and he talks to me like I’m incompetent, like I’m beneath the undergrads he supervises.

And speaking of undergrads, his behavior around them is... unsettling. He flirts with them—constantly making comments with a weird sexual undertone. He goes out of his way to be charming and overly friendly with the young women in the lab, always lingering around them, making inappropriate jokes, or giving them unnecessary compliments about their looks. It’s disgusting and appalling. And yet, he has the nerve to treat me like I’m some kind of burden. I have not brought these issues up with anyone because I am tired and I do not know if anyone will buy what I say, since other people in the lab seem to be seeing nothing wrong with it.

I feel like the black sheep of my lab. Group meetings are unbearable. I know grad school is tough, and maybe he thinks this will ""make me a better scientist,"" but for two years, I’ve felt nothing but unsupported and dismissed. I’m exhausted.

I don’t know what to do anymore. How do you push through when you feel like you’re barely holding on? I cried all last night to my partner. I really want to give up and master out, but a part of me wants to continue to make myself proud. I really want my degree and I really enjoy chemistry, but all this shit I have mentioned here has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.

I have been contemplating on whether or not if I should draft an email to the GAR about my concerns and how I am really demotivated in this lab. This PI i have does not even seem open to the idea of possibly collaborating (EVEN in the SAME DEPT). I need a challenge and my brain thirsts for knowledge, I wish I could collaborate with someone at this point, I would feel like my potential to be put to use.

P.S I want to also mention that I have my BS in Biochemistry and my MS in Molecular Biology. I wanted to be a medical doctor at first, but that changed for me when I did research. I realized I wanted to do a PhD instead because I was always curious about the things I was learning at hand and I really want to do something in genetic editing tying chemistry with it someday.

1hvy5rq,Students Impacted by the Pandemic (Class of 2020),"Hi everyone,

I graduated from high school in 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic turned our lives upside down. I enrolled in college in Fall 2020 and was fortunate to receive substantial TOPS funding due to my 3.9 GPA and a composite ACT score of 28. Along with Pell Grants and other scholarships, my financial aid covered tuition at a local university and even provided me with refunds.

However, by December 2021, I made the difficult decision to withdraw from my program. The lack of in-person classes was one of the main reasons. Remote learning just wasn’t effective for me, and it completely drained the academic morale I had built up through years of preparation for college. I’ve always struggled with online learning, and it didn’t align with the college experience I had envisioned.

Now, three years later, I’m ready to return to school and pursue my degree. But this time, I’ve discovered that my financial aid options are far more limited. The bulk of my previous funding came from Louisiana’s TOPS program, which I believe I’m no longer eligible for.

I’m reaching out to see if there are any scholarships, grants, or other financial aid programs available for students like me—those who enrolled in college for the first time during the pandemic and were negatively affected by the resulting shutdowns and remote learning.

And apologies in advance, I have written for hours on this post and it has already become quite long, even though I have tried to shorten it again. I hope it's still somewhat coherent. If anybody of you takes the time to read it, thank you very much, you are awesome! :)  


**TLDR:** I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University (i.e. I have already earned my Masters degree 4 years ago) with 2 more years until the final deadline. I have worked for 2-3 years on a project, which I abandoned 10months ago without proper results as it didn't work out. Afterwards, I have started a new project, but again find myself in a bad place and worried about my mental health. My supervisor has been and is completely unsupportive. Now, I'm torn between trying to push on and quitting. I am worried that in the first case I'll further ruin my mental health, in the second case I'm worried about regretting the decision later and experiencing it as failure possibly also making me unhappy.  


**Some basic information about me and my PhD program**  
I am in the 4th year of my PhD program in (Applied) Mathematics at a German University. As it is typical in Germany, I have already earned my Masters degree before the PhD. I am 29 years old. I have a position that, with around 48k, is an uncommonly well payed position. Funding is available for 2 more years. I am also accepted as a PhD student at the University for 2 more years, a significant extension beyond this is unlikely. In the first year I (and my supervisor) didn't have any idea for a research topic and at the same time I was TA for one of the big Mathematics lectures. Nevertheless, I gradually managed to work out a project and start working on it. For the following 2-2.5 years I have worked on this project. About 10 months ago I quit the previous project as it didn't work out and switched to a new project, which is only vaguely connected to the old one. Since then, I have no teaching obligations anymore.  


**The problems/reasons why I consider to quit**  
The problems basically fall into three categories.  
*i) Related to my well being/mental health:* This is the most important aspect for me. For most of the previous project I have felt continuously unhappy at work. The topic change has given me a motivation boost, but this has worn off again by now. Instead, I now find myself in a situation, where I am unable to even properly focus on my work anymore (even though it's actually not that complicated right now), have repeatedly sleep problems, frequently feel completely drained and/or sad after being at work and occasionally am even unable to motivate myself for activities outside of work. Fortunately, the issues mostly pass once I have a few days off from work, but still I have the fear that they might become persistent if I push through it even longer. Moreover, my self-confidence has completely vanished over the years in my PhD. Even though I try to not attach it to the progress in my PhD, my self-esteem has suffered significantly, too.  Finally, I don't feel like I have the energy to do all the things I still need to do if I want to finish my PhD.   
*ii) Related to my progress:* I have worked for between 2 and 3 years on the previous project. However, the only outcome of this project is a ""proof"" which relies on an assumption whose validity cannot be established by the current state of the research in the field and which we therefore never tried to publish. My supervisor has never given me a proper Yes or No whether he would be fine if I include it in my dissertation, even though I have asked/discussed it multiple times. In the new project, I have made some progress that, however, is only of interest for our industrial partner in the project, but does not involve any Mathematical progress and that I cannot include in my dissertation due to the NDA with the industrial partner. I have started working on some minor Mathematical contributions but are stuck, see also i). As a consequence, I have no results at all so far that I can include in my dissertation. Obviously, I have not submitted any papers or given any talks anywhere as a consequence.  
*iii) Related to my supervisor:* My supervisor has been and continues to be completely unsupportive. To be precise, he does not reply to mails, is absent most of the time, is unable to provide both strategical and mathematical advice and does not provide feedback even if explicitly asked to do so. So far it has especially been almost impossible to discuss the problems I had in my PhD so far with him. The perfect example for our relationship is the situation where I wanted to discuss the option of taking a break from my PhD for an internship outside of academia. As he was again absent for a while, I have sent him an email in which I roughly outlined the topic and asked for a meeting. He then ignored my email (and a follow-up one) for several weeks, and when I accidentally stumbled upon him at work, he told me, in (without exaggeration) just about 30 seconds, that he is against it and that he now has to attend a meeting. Afterwards, there haven't been any further discussion about it.  


**Why I have started and so far continued the PhD**  
Originally, I have started my PhD probably for some of the worst reasons possible. Up until my PhD, I have been a rather good student even finishing my Masters with the best possible grade. And, I'm not gonna lie, at that point I had based a lot of my self esteem on this fact/on seeing me as an intelligent person which is able to handle most intellectual challenges. In that sense, doing a PhD seemed as the next logical step to prove this view of myself to myself. Moreover, it was convenient as my supervisor offered me the position at the University I was already at with an uncommonly good salary of around 48000€. A former professor who just retired when I started my PhD and who was very renowned in the field that I am working now additionally promised me that he will help me to organize research stays at other interesting Universities. Of course, I was also somewhat excited about the research area, even though it now feels like I have never had a really deep interest in it.   
What then kept me in my PhD at all the multiple times where I thought about quitting, is that I really enjoy teaching and would like to increase my chances of doing University/College level teaching later on, that I can't help but see quitting as a failure of myself and an increasingly strong sunk cost fallacy. Recently, also the fear that quitting a PhD after such a long time might give possible future employees the impression that I am not a competent Mathematician, that I am not perseverant and that I am not able to make the right decision at the right time has added to that. 

**My options and how I look at them**

*i) Continue to push through my PhD for 2 more years:* If I find a way to focus again at work and possibly make progress on some of the topics I am stuck at, I could imagine that this scenario works out. However, I am seriously worried that nevertheless the mental health issues I am already encountering become even more severe and constant along the way and that the joy/pride of pushing through is not even remotely compensating this anymore.  
*ii) Apply for a new job:* If my current job was a ""normal"" job, i.e. not possibly rewarded with a PhD, I am almost certain that I would have changed jobs already. And I can imagine that I might be happier in another job (after a while). However, I can also very well imagine that the feeling of failure together with the thoughts about ""what if I had finished it"" might be so powerful that I also end up really unhappy in this scenario. And I have noticed that, whenever I seriously picture me leaving the PhD behind, I get a very strong and dreadful feeling of actually deserving a PhD and having being cheated out of the possibility that keeps me from accepting this scenario. Of course, I am well aware that this is a weird, bad and unjustified sense of entitlement - Mark Manson sens his regards. I think this comes from the fact that friends of mine that are probably not significantly better researchers are about to finish.

1bvcm9g,Passed my oral defence! Tips for those who are nervous,"I had my oral defence last week and successfully passed with no changes!!

It's been a rough ride but I'm so glad that it's come to an end (I've been done since end of last summer)...almost because my supervisor is still being a PITA but whatever.

For those who are preparing to defend and are nervous...there's little you can do about the nerves because it's a normal human emotion.  Just embrace the nervousness and try to keep yourself busy.  I had to take Pepto Bismol 4 days leading to my defence even though I knew I was going to pass (external was 'very supportive') and I was prepared lol. Afterwards I was so completely drained and exhausted. 

At the defence though, I was not nervous and got through my presentation without a hitch. The questions were more of a discussion...so basically everything everyone has been saying ended up true.  Leading up to the defence is the hardest part...the anticipation, thinking the worse, etc. It really isn't that bad but our mind will tell us differently.

Fortunately, I had a chiro appointment booked for later that day - ohhh I really needed that adjustment.  I also didn't sleep the day before or the 3 nights after (most of that was due to my supervisor's BS though).

The lab, an introductory lab for my major, was filled with errors in the manuals and sample data. I spent some time in this semester to correct these, and raised concerns about their existence (these were the same materials I used as an undergrad, 4-5 years prior). My advisor has been dismissive of my lab concerns, stating that the research should be my only priority, which I strongly disagree with. They recommended that I take a course outside of the scope of my field, which I am most certainly going to fail in. 

  
The lab has caused issues, as a PhD student who has taught the lab for many semesters keeps using the error-filled materials and shown a lack of care and understanding in the material. The professor in charge of the lab keeps so busy that they didn't show up to a month's worth of our lab meetings, nor would they respond to email questions from other TAs. I ended up taking up some of the slack dropped by them and spent extra time to help the other TAs understand the materials or how to handle other lab responsibilities. 

  
My graduate program as a whole seems to completely given up as well. I still haven't been assigned a desk on campus, even when new students in the spring would recieve theirs. After constantly pestering the people in charge of assigning the desks, they told me they overassigned desks and decided to remove my name from the list. This response angered me, especially knowing that there are desks in the graduate offices that are barely used at all (one desk was only used once this semester, for 30 minutes, according to the graduate students surrounding the desk).

  
With the research, my advisor is under pressure from the department to produce results, and has passed this pressure onto me. With everything else I am handling, I do not have the time to spend 3 days (at minimum) monitoring the setup to make sure nothing breaks/leaks/catches fire/gets tampered with by others. 

  
I feel completely drained and battered from this program, and I know my grades this semester will reflect it. I wouldn't be surprised if I am dismissed this semester and honestly I want it to happen. The department and my advisor do not seem to care about anything other than research. All interest I had in the research, classes, and my major as a whole have gone down the drain. I have a job that wants me (they wanted to hire me right out of my undergraduate, but mentioned that they would eventually want me to gain my masters), so I won't be drowning or wandering aimlessly if I do leave the program. I just don't feel any motivation to do any work for my classes and research.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1c6teq0/feeling_like_dropping_out_of_my_masters/

14qak7w,Not sure I can handle marching band,"Just like the title says, I'm 19F rising sophomore at Vanderbilt University and want to do marching band so so so bad (especially since my highschool didn't have a program), but I'm scared I can't handle it mentally.

For context, my first semester was terrible, I was depressed as shit and ended up scraping by with a 2.0 GPA, but I knew what I needed to improve and although it was one of the hardest things ever, in my spring semester I pulled through with a 3.2 (which isn't great by any means but still improvement). I'm taking an extra class this semester and switching into the school of engineering as well (biochemistry to biomedical engineering with the goal of a master's degree). I have horrible time management which Im actively trying my best to work on, but combined with the fleeting depression it seems like a daunting task.

Keeping all this in mind, I obviously have some doubts about joining the band. I've played trumpet and trombone for years but never marched before and want to learn a whole new instrument (something on drumline) . I never even did any extracurriculars my freshman year and I'm scared I'll be too focused on school to do any now or to commit to anything, but also scared that I wont be able to put my all into either because of my horrible time skills. My heart is saying to just take the leap of faith and go for it; if it flops, it flops. But my brain is saying to try and figure myself out this year and register next year when I'm more used to things (which my parents also want for me). The binding form is due on the 10th, so any input would be greatly appreciated!!! It just sucks I feel like everyone except me can actually do the things they want and be involved in everything meanwhile I'm mentally inept. My time management is so bad I was getting no more than 4 hours of sleep a night on my lucky days, and I seriously considered getting screened for ADHD just to find any type of solution...even though i never exhibited any behaviors in youth. My social life has been completely drained and my friends wouldn't see me for a week plus. I hate this shit.

Thank you for the help in advance!

adix1h,I feel like I was catfished into my PhD,"Hi all,  I'm sorry for this lengthy post, you can find a TL;DR at the end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm now starting my second year of my PhD and I've been struggling a lot to keep up with it. 

&#x200B;

Firstly, during the PhD interview the PI said I'd be doing a lot of computational work, which is my field of expertise, and a little bit of wet lab, which was also ok since I wanted to get some experience in it too. However, since the day I started feels like my supervisor completely forgot my background and didn't provide me the opportunity to learn the necessary lab techniques. When I started writing my project, my first draft was written according to my expectations, with a lot of computational work I thought was meaningful and made sense. On first review, my boss changed the whole thing putting computational work completely aside. I tried to talk to her and she said it was something that would be done alongside wet lab and not to worry about it and so I trusted her. Things started to get worse after that as I have yet to touch a single line of code or software and have been working in the lab nonstop. Having close to no experience in wet lab and the fact that my supervisor gives me no support made things started to go wrong and I see myself stuck in problems I have no idea how to solve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was supposed to continue the work of a previous MSc student who allegedly left things working properly. My boss always said the stuff I was supposed to use was optimised and worked fine, so when I started working on it I wasn't expecting much difficulty to get any type of results. I was wrong, for almost 4 months I was bumping into a huge wall I couldn't overcome, I wasn't able to come up with positive results, which made me think that probably the system my PI thought to be optimised was not after all. This started creating a lot of pressure in me and my work as my PI kept saying it was an issue on my end, due to my lack of experience in wet lab techniques. I asked a few colleagues to test whatever I was doing to see if it was indeed on my end, but turns out they got the exact same results as me and still my boss keeps saying it works, making me test the same things again and again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I feel like I've been learning a lot and I actually enjoy the problem I'm trying to address, however it is getting extremely frustrating trying to prove a point that my boss refuses to accept and is a bottleneck on my work, being put down instantly due to ""not having enough experience"". This, altogether with what I was expecting to do and was promised to do being completely different to what I am actually doing makes me think if I can endure 3 more years of this. I feel my work is not appreciated, despite being improving a lot and working 7 days a week. I've tried to talk to her but she's an ""old school"" PI, becoming very hard to reason with her because she's always right and I'm not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point I feel completely drained and start to think if I should pursue a different PhD. I've started looking for other labs and institutes, but I'm struggling with the fact that I need to submit references for these places too. Although my previous referees are still present in my life to this day and we have a great relationship, I feel bad for going back to them and ask for their help once again. I fear they might judge me wrong and do not understand my current situation. I feel miserable and unhappy, but I don't want to seem ungrateful and that I don't fight for the opportunities given to me. Asking reference letters from my current PI is obviously outside of the picture.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, if I do follow up with the idea to change PhD project, how would I include my current research experience in my CV? Research assistant? I think including stuff like ""PhD Student"" would not benefit me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my PI catfished me into my PhD project and now I feel miserable and I'm thinking to quit and get a new one. However, I don't know how to ask for new reference letters to my previous referees as I am afraid of how they will response to my current situation.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/adix1h/i_feel_like_i_was_catfished_into_my_phd/
ucad33,Need support and guidance.,"So, I will be moving to Switzerland after 3 months to start my PhD there. Currently I am writing my Master's thesis in my current university in India. 10 days ago, I had a final breakup in an year long relationship. These emotional fluctuations has been going on for last 2-3 months. All these past months I endured all the pain and kept working on my PhD applications. Now when I got what I wanted (PhD admit), I feel completely drained (emotionally). I am feeling a huge weight of sadness over my head all the time. Recently I developed migraine too. I don't know if this is depression or something else but it's killing me. I don't even have money to go for therapy. I don't even have anybody to talk to about these things. Because of all this, I am not able to write my Master's thesis too.

Now, I am afraid that if I somehow manage to move to a different country in this situation to start my PhD, will I be able to do justice with the PhD position. And I think I will get more and more depressed as I won't even find any familiar faces there to talk to.

113asvp,Is my PhD getting nowhere ?,"Hello guys, been lurking the sub for some time, first time posting. I'm in my third year of my PhD in Italy, Nanotechnology course, and for the last few weeks i've been felling quite down with the state of my PhD, feeling like i'm getting nowhere and i often can't even understand the basics of my field, expecially in data revision and analysis and sometimes in operating with the lab equipment.   
I feel more often than not completely drained of motivation to get stuff done and i find myself drowning in an inch of water, utterly overwhelmed by the task that looms in front of me. I think that played a great part on making me develop a severe procrastination issue; if i don't have any experiment to run, i find myself sitting at the desk in my office for hours, doing anything but work. I feel there is almost nothing that i enjoy about my topic anymore, i simply show up at the lab and do what they tell me to do. I should start to work on my thesis, but i haven't even started to write a paper (i'm not the only one in my year facing this last issue. but still).

My supervisor (actually, my-co supervisor, the one that really works with me) is not happy with that, a couple months ago he we had a long conversation, and he told me that he feels like ""You are only a little more capable to use the instrumentation than you were when you started, you should be autonomous at this point, but i don't feel comfortable leaving alone you and one of the master students with the machine"" and that ""I don't know how i can recommend you to anyone looking for post-docs next year, i don't feel you would be able to handle yourself"". 

  
My PhD school does a mid of the year workshop, where each student presents its result to the rest of the (frankly very heterogeneous, in terms of fields of study) course, that this year comes next week, and with my co-supervisor and others of the group we looked at my presentation today. There were a lot of errors, and they told me that it looks like i'm unable to present and expose my result in an understandable way, and he (the co-sup.) thinks that its because i have still some theorethical doubts. We were planning to do a reversal on Friday, but now i'm not sure if they want to give me some more time or not. In any case, the workshop is due next Wensday,    


I don't know what i can do, i'm very tired, i've also considered taking a break from the project, a couple months just to see if my mental health improves, but here in Italy is not easy to obtain, there are no breaks periods provided by the university, apart from maternity leave, if i'm not mistaken. Maybe is better if i just leave,   


Before you said it, I've tried to have a work-life balance, like i've discovered DnD in the mid of my first year, and now i have two campaigns with friends that i'm Dming weekly, but this hasn't helped with the work, quite the opposite actually it just gave me another excuse to procrastinate, to do other things apart from work. At the same time, this hobby is maybe the most important thing that keeps me going, the thing that gives me joy, so i don't want to abandon it, i feel it would not help me.

vnyqvl,I'm a soon to be PhD student questioning if it really is a right path for me. But I don't know what are my other options.,"Hi, I'm a soon to be PhD student once I receive Master's degree in Public health major of Veterinary medicine department in August. I graduated with DVM course as an undergrad and currently have a license to perform as a veterinarian in one of the East Asian countries.



But the Master's degree program, straight after my vet med course seems to have completely drained me out.  I think there are many reasons behind it, but to begin with my professor is a old school workaholic, who brings projects that we really have to stretch to deal with. For my prof, working till late and having to come to work even on weekends, not having decent summer/winter vacation time is just part of the course. Also, I'm the only vet in the lab, making all the animal related jobs such as necropsies fall on top of me as well as the other projects my professor brings in. And my coworkers seems to have no regard for the extra work I have to do as a vet, and insist that the group work has to be divided evenly between three of us (there's me and the other 2 coworkers in the lab, all of us are in Master's course. But I graduate in 1.5years and they'll graduate in 2 years bc they lack vet license). It has been crazy journey so far, and now that I'm at the verge of graduating with Master's degree, makes me think if PhD is really what I want. Especially so bc while performing necropsies, doing common project with the other 2 coworkers, and preparing my own Master's dissertation the last couple months felt like a living hell to me. I had to work until 1am even on weekends. I also had some health issues during the course, such as gastritis, esophagitis, stomach cramps, ovarian cysts and not to mention, depression.



Once I made up my mind that I at least need a semester break before starting my PhD course, I talked to my professor that I need a rest for my health. And prof said yes at first. But then couple days later, I was called in again and said if I want to get PhD with thesis written using the data collected from the project of this year and last year, I can't take a break. Bc that project is 3 years long one and prof still needs me to do necropsies and other vet works even on 3rd year of the project. And added that if I'm not doing my part for 3rd year of the project, I'll be denied access of the data I collected from 1st and 2nd year. Unless I'm having open abdominal surgeries (prof's exact words), I'm not allowed to take any semester off. And (again, prof's words), having such hard time, is how grad course is supposed to be. So I said I need some time to think about.



And hearing that drove me even further away from the idea of PhD course. I actively started searching other options for vet with MPH abroad. But I'm not sure which one to pursue. I'm thinking of getting PAVE course to get American vet license, or getting working permit in EU as a vet. But honestly, I feel lost among the options.



TLDR: I'm a vet with MPH, searching for new career paths abroad. I don't want to pursue doctorate anymore bc I feel burnt out to crisp. Looking for advices to deal with this situation and career paths.

d15361,"Not a freeway flyer anymore, and it feels GREAT!","For the last EIGHT years, I have taught at anywhere from two to four college campuses per year, picking up whatever courses they would throw at me, often six or seven per semester. One semester, I taught 7 courses, all 7 different preps, spanning THREE different disciplines (Composition, ESL, Linguistics) at THREE different campuses, ***each in a different county***, all in the same semester. And then I would teach 6-12 units every summer. No rest for the wicked.

I was too often late getting essays graded, and usually by about the 8 or 9 week mark, I would be feeling completely drained. My health suffered. My car depreciated (~25K miles per year on average). I began to envision life forever as a bought-and-paid-for member of the ever-loyal-but-never-valued contingent labor brigade. Over the last 8 years or so, I think I only cracked $50K in gross earnings once, maybe twice. And then only just barely. But what else could I do? I have no marketable skills, save my better-than-average mind and what seems to be a knack for teaching. Besides, teaching is all I've done since 1992; it's what I love.

So after years of applying for full-time positions (TT positions at local community colleges, as well as full-time non-instructional positions like Writing Center Director and ESOL Coordinator) and getting nowhere (4-5 interviews, 2 second round, only 1 final round), and after years of FRIGHTENING declines in enrollment (20-30% drop at my main institution in recent years, ENGL has lost nearly half its adjuncts, they're threatening full-time TT faculty position retrenchments within 2 years if trends do not change) and too many scary, and expensive, course cancellations, I finally went back to teaching high school full time.  My salary instantly jumped $15K+, and I know I am not getting any of my classes cancelled. And benefits. Sick days, Family days. A *really* strong union.

However, I still need money to get out of some of the the debt that my years as a freeway-flying adjunct put me into, so I still teach college in the evenings. And besides, I still love it -- I'm not ready to give it up. I still teach at my main institution, my 9th year with this really great little community college, in a super department with a really supportive chair. I teach a 6-unit ALP cohort (freshman comp paired with a developmental comp) two nights a week, ~20 students. 

With only 20 students, I am SOOOO much more able to stay on top of things, plan, grade, keep in touch with students, etc... I feel less pressure, and almost no stress. I have extra time on my hands, at least, a lot more than I ever did. (Yes, teaching high school is a lot of work, but my HS schedule has a lot of built-in prep time each day.) My college students will benefit from this. And I'm making ~$32,000 a year more than I ever did as an adjunct (my HS salary bump, plus 6 units at my CC per semester), and I feel GREAT!!!

Only 2 weeks into the new year, but I am optimistic for the first time in years. Am I pissed that I never got that TT teaching gig at my CC? Yeah, kind of. I still feel the sting of failure, even though I know [it probably wasn't personal](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Didnt-They-Pick-Me-/151391?cid=cp76). I would have been great.

4g5q2b,Does grad school get any better after the first year?,"Well, in a few weeks I will be finished with the first year of my PhD program (bioengineering), and I can honestly say that it has been the most miserable year of my life. I've never felt so down and so unsure of my personal and professional path. I despise my classes and the endless tedious work that comes with them. I have received virtually no guidance or direction from my extremely hands off PI. Thus, I did quite literally no research all year, and I don't even know what my research work should be, despite multiple attempts to meet with my PI and figure things out. I’ve lost all interest in my field, in classes, and in research. My motivation is completely drained. 

Looking back, I think I convinced myself that I loved my field and loved research simply because I wanted to be special and get those three letters after my name. But I look around at my classmates, and they have a scientific enthusiasm that I just don’t have. I’m a fairly hard worker when I have practical and tangible goals to achieve. Research is just too amorphous and too abstract when someone isn’t spelling everything out for me. But maybe I’m only having these thoughts because of my bad first year experience…

Sorry for the rant. I’d love to hear about peoples’ experiences following their first year. Did things get better? Worse? No change? Did you hit your stride in the lab? Did your PI pay more attention to you? Did decreased course work allow you to have some life outside of school? If things don’t improve, I’ll definitely be leaving with an MS. I’m just terrified that, without the PhD, I’ll fall into an unfulfilling career path.

hvxqyf,I didn't sign up for an online M.S. (sad rant),"Hi guys, I'm new to the sub and have been debating about posting here but I'm just really at crossroads with my masters program. (It might be a little rambling so apologies in advance, and honestly I'm sad so the grammar probably won't be great either.) I have horrible imposter syndrome, and I have since high school. My first semester of undergrad I was Undecided. My parents were helping me pay for school, so I figured I needed to pick something before the second semester started, and I had always loved writing/reading/art/music aka was not your typical STEM student. I went with Advertising, thought it would be a good time and still allow for some creativity. However, my mother decided I wouldn't be going back to campus until I picked an engineering discipline, otherwise 'I would never find a job.' I realize now how awful this is and I should've just taken out the loans and made my own choices, but my newly discovered codependency issues are a topic for a different sub.

Fast forward 4.5 years, I graduated with a degree in civil engineering and I'm 2 semesters into my graduate program. I still consider myself as someone who isn't great at math, science, reading graphs, what have you. I graduated with honors, won a small grant, made a research poster, and won a couple small undergrad research awards. Do I still feel highly unqualified for every single engineering job on the planet? Yes. 

Before the pandemic started, I loved everything about my graduate program. My PI is awesome. I worked for him for 2 years in undergrad, and he got me into research, took the time to teach me relevant computer programs, and is just generally pretty supportive. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do upon graduating, so he asked me to stay and be on his research team and told me I wouldn't have to pay for anything. All is well at this point. I thought I had won the lottery. No 9-5 job AND no loans? Deal. I took my first 2 classes, one of which he taught (stressful), and I was thrown in to teaching 3 lab sections for a class I never even took with about 4 days notice, and that was outside of our department. This was a great experience, I tutored in undergrad and generally enjoy teaching. I was finally getting regular non-hourly paychecks for the first time in my life-- I never had an industry internship/job in undergrad because I had to spend so much time studying outside of class, because again, STEM was not my first, second, or third choice. Things seemed great. I was intimidated by being the only female and the only masters student in an office/classroom of 6 PhD students, but they are all lovely people and are willing to help me when I ask (also something I'm bad at).

Now, months into the pandemic, I cannot see the end of my masters program even though its supposedly next spring/summer. Online school is just a different animal. I don't see my PI anymore aside from weekly Zoom meetings, which he often reschedules or cancels. I feel like my thesis topic was never mine to begin with, which I welcomed when I started but now find myself dreading having to read journal articles about/actually research. The more I get into it, the more in over my head I feel. The topic seemed feasible at the beginning, and the more I'm reading the less feasible it seems. I am going to need to learn multiple programs, and I'm just not horribly interested in doing so. Sometimes I think I understand what we're going for, and then we call and are on completely different pages. I was supposed to be teaching in the fall, and now I'm not sure that is happening with the movement of many classes online. I don't want to go into too many pointless details here I just feel out of my league and stuck. 

The thing is, I'm used to feeling out of my league, but I never used to feel worthless. I feel like I'm living for choices my parents made for me, and I know they meant well, but I feel so cheated. I was really into lit in high school, and ceramics. Art and english were my go to's, and I can't help but think about how much happier I would be and where I would be now if I had put all the time and money spent the last 5 years into something I was already good at, instead of something my parents thought I should be good at. Forcing myself to go through differential equations, upper level physics, sediment transport and fluid dynamics and so forth was harrowing. I cried a lot, I didn't sleep a lot of nights. I don't know how to quit things, and I have some bad honors kid syndrome so failing wasn't an option. I didn't fail, GPA-wise I did really well but I feel like in some ways undergrad snapped every ounce of confidence and self assuredness I had. When I graduated, I didn't feel relieved. I just felt lost. 

I like to feel challenged, but the work I've been doing lately has left me feeling completely drained, inept, and bad about myself. In the spring, one of my first grad classes was on river mechanics. It was taught by my undergrad advisor, a badass sandal wearing chain smoking no shit taking Italian woman who I look up to in so many ways and am also thoroughly intimidated by. She's the reason I ever got involved in undergrad research at all-- she told me she would kill herself at a normal civil desk job and that I shouldn't feel like that was my only option so she dropped me in my PI's office and told him I wanted a job. Fast forward to me taking one of her classes with only my PhD officemates as classmates. Fast forward again to the end of the class, which was being taught online. In an attempt to be gracious, all of our HW assignments' due dates were extended indefinitely. If we couldn't finish the class by the end of the semester, she would give us an incomplete, and we would have an entire calendar year to finish the assignments. For a month after the semester ended, I stared at the same HW assignment. I couldn't not get an A in her class. In the midst of regular teaching, wrapping up grading for my 70 lab students and my research responsibilities, I had this looming thing to stare at everyday after dinner, for hours. This was the beginning of the disintegration of whatever confidence in myself I had left. I eventually got some help with it from one my officemates, along with a lecture about asking for help, and how none of them completed the assignment on their own either, and a needed talk about how this was not something I should've felt I needed to prove to myself. 

Once this was done, a huge weight was lifted only to be replaced with my PI telling me I should apply for a NSF grant. I didn't know anything about it. I said ok. I started reading up on how much of a big deal they were, and made the mistake of looking at past winning personal statements. Oh my god, have I ever felt under qualified. Ivy league schools and international lab experience, patents, more volunteer work than I have ever participated in. I know this is not something I should be doing. I have expressed this to my PI, citing that while my graduate GPA is fine, my undergrad GPA and sum of experiences were not competitive with what I had seen. He told me a free try was a free try, and to write it up anyway. I have spent weeks trying to write my personal statement. I find every excuse to walk away from my laptop, and my heart is not in it. I simply do not have the qualifications for this, and all its doing is making me feel worse about myself. If I knew only my PI was going to be reading it and we could send it off I wouldn't care, but the pressure of knowing this needs to be the best thing I've ever written because he's going to share it with the department head and other faculty for suggestions is so anxiety-inducing I'm paralyzed by it. Additionally, I am going to have to ask people I respect within the department for recommendation letters for something I know, with a 16% acceptance rate, I will not be awarded. I finished a draft of it yesterday, and even sending it to friends who aren't in grad school for their initial thoughts, they think its too 'soft'. 

I just didn't sign up for any of this. I am at such a crossroads with myself, where I want to take advantage of this opportunity for a free education but I think its costing me more than money. I never used to be an anxious person, and last week I drove myself to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. Turned out it was just really bad acid reflux, but that's not something I've ever had before. I'm worried that I'm so stressed its beginning to affect the way my body is functioning, as well as my general demeanor. I'm 23 years old. I should be confident, and happy, and starting a career. For the first time in my life I feel genuinely depressed and anxious to the point I hate getting out of bed in the morning. I just wanted to get my masters degree. I didn't realize signing up for this would entail all of the additional conference abstracts, committee joining, and fellowship writing for a PhD I don't even want. This is a topic I do not know how to broach with someone funding my being in the program. 

The issue with leaving the department is that I feel like I would be letting so many people down. I know its not healthy to think I'm in grad school for my parents, or my PI, but that is how it feels right now, especially since I'm not paying for it. I don't believe I'm under contract or anything, but I'm sure I would have to pay back the two semester's worth of tuition, which I obviously do not just have sitting around. The prospect of finding a job in this market is also anxiety inducing. However, I'm worried about my health. I'm struggling to justify completely quitting solely because of how happy I was before the pandemic. My mental health has never been so poor, and I can't tell how much of it is quarantine making my walls close in and how much of it is just that I've finally had enough quiet to realize how unhappy I am. 

I'm sorry this is so long. If anyone has any advice, I'm here for it. I'm just really at the end of my rope here, and its affecting my relationships outside of school. I don't want to do anything rash, but I also don't know if I can continue like this. 

TLDR - I loved grad school prior to the pandemic, but now that everything is online my masters thesis seems awful and my mental health is really suffering. My PI is making apply for multiple conference presentations and a NSF grant I know I won't get but I don't know how to tell him no because he is funding my being in my masters program. Would it be rash to drop out during the pandemic? Finding a job right now seems terrifying. I don't know if I'm prioritizing the right things here, any advice or just general thoughts/your personal experiences would be really, really helpful.",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/hvxqyf/i_didnt_sign_up_for_an_online_ms_sad_rant/
7go82w,Struggling with motivation/adjusting to grad school,"Hi all. First Reddit post since being a long time lurker and a relatively new user. Quick backstory. I graduated from undergrad in December of 2013 and was completely drained. I was working 45-50 hours a week while going to school full-time, participating in research and being on the chair for my alma mater's psych club. I knew I needed to go to grad school to be a school counselor or academic advisor, but I was drained and had no energy to put towards grad school applications. So, I just moved my way up at GameStop to become an Assistant Store Leader and worked part-time at a grocery store to make ends meet. I then got a ""real job"" and started working in a prevocational work facility helping adults with disabilities integrate into the community and land community-based jobs. Lastly, I did a year of service with AmeriCorps - 3 hours away from home. I lived in the town I grew up in all 26 years of my life, and moving away from the family and friends I cared about was rough. I then applied to grad school after four years out of school and got in. I thought it was a fluke, but alas, it was not. 

I guess that wasn't really brief, but I felt like it needed to be told to explain how I'm feeling. Basically - I am struggling immensely with trying to get motivated to get my work done. I feel as if I don't belong (imposter syndrome) and that there is no point in trying because I shouldn't be in grad school. I'm not nearly as intelligent as my cohort, I don't really get along with my cohort (they're nice and all, but I don't see them outside of classes - 3 of the 4 are actually online), I have no friends or social connections, and I Just downright feel shitty. I used to be the guy who would wake up at 6 AM every day, watch GMA (I know, I'm old hahah), drink coffee, go to work, get shit done, come home and do it all over again. Now... I struggle to get out of bed by 9 AM. I would rather sit and play video games, browse the internet, or watch Hulu/Netflix than do anything. I have no drive. Where did it go?! I used to be very driven.

Anyway, thanks for listening, Reddit. If anyone has any advice, words of wisdom, or ways to fight this - because I truly do want to finish this and get my dream job.

b2crbw,Mental/Physical Health During Dissertation Time,"Hi.

I'm posting this somewhat reluctantly, but I feel like it's worth it. 

I posted here earlier this weekend.  I've gotten through the committee, and I earned my IRB approval.  Earlier this week I began my actual experiment after recruiting. 

I spent most of the weekend transcribing the videotape of the small group, and I'm not done. 

I have a day job,and I suppose that I should mention that I am hard-of-hearing, so this transcribing process might be taking me longer than it should.  I already purchased a new microphone for future small-group discussions. 

I guess here's my question.  How do people in this portion of the program maintain their physical and mental health?

The gym is a great way to blow off steam. I used to have a mentor that told me how biking saved her sanity during this portion.  I'm completely drained right now and I was hoping to get to the gym  sometime this weekend. A therapist told me ""a regular workout routine is considered standard treatment for depression"". I just want to maintain some degree of physical and mental health. 

Everyone has told me that this is the hardest part of the process. I just wanted to ask if anyone had any advice.  Thanks.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/b2crbw/mentalphysical_health_during_dissertation_time/
dixy6m,Leaving after 4 years,"I think I need to leave my PhD program after 4 years for a number of reasons. 

1) Financial. We had a catastrophic failure of a piece of vital equipment that delayed my research by 4 months. Other problems have occurred and I have been working unpaid for 1 year now. I took a part time RA job but my savings are completely drained and I cannot survive any more. 

2) I developed severe anxiety and depression. I took some time and started to recover. I have been back in the country for 5 days and the thought of going back is already making me panic. I don’t want to lose all of the progress I have made

3) Other scientific concerns that I don’t feel comfortable discussing on here. These have been validated by other colleagues so I know it is not my depression talking. 

I have done most of my lab work, save for ~2 months of data processing. Even at this point I think it would still be worth me leaving the program. 

Has anyone else ever left after spending a significant time on their PhD? I’m worried about how to explain this on my CV and how it will affect my job prospects even though I know that it is the right decision for me.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/dixy6m/leaving_after_4_years/

9p4lgr,"I want to drop out, but I don't think that I can. Help?","I've been in university since Autumn of 2014, and I have absolutely hated it from the first day. I initially enrolled as an art major, but switched to English with concentration in Creative Writing within a few weeks. My GPA was bad from the beginning, and I've only had one semester in these four and a half years in which all of my class grades were higher than a C. I've been on academic suspension twice, and will be kicked out if my GPA goes below 2.0 again, so that is a constant worry for me.

I stupidly took the advice from my counselor to get all of my core classes out of the way first, and ended up having to retake all of them about two or three times each, as I've either failed or withdrawn from them. At this point, I'm basically done and only have English classes left, but I hate these. I don't know how it is at other places, but here, literature and writing classes are taught by complete idiots (with very few exceptions).

A while ago, I took archaeology and history courses, which I quite liked, and considered changing my major because of them. However, as I've said, I'm a fifth-year senior, and I've already wasted a lot of money on trying to force my way to a bacheolor's degree. In the simplest of terms, I'm just taking the quickest path to graduation. Looking back on my studies, I can honestly say that I have learned nothing of any value as a result of being here.

Employment is under control, I guess, at this point. I recently started a job which doesn't have the best pay, but is quite easy and not exhausting at all. As far as finances go, I'm mostly alright, as I only really spend money on groceries and things necessary for classes/work, now. However, my work history might look weird to other employers; I worked at one job for two months before quitting, then went unemployed for about six months before getting this job (despite applying to over 200 places, I only got these two jobs because of ""quantity-over-quality"" hiring and nepotism, respectively).

According to my list, I only have about five or six more classes to take, but I am completely drained of all motivation to finish. If I do throw in the towel now, I would have wasted a huge amount of money. I know that the money and time is already wasted, since I've spent so much of both on a useless degree, but I've always been told that a bachelor's in and of itself is better than no bachelor's.

I know that if I were to take this sort of opinion to a counselor, they would suggest some option that involves staying in college, so I know that that would be less objective than it would be somewhere like here (maybe). Anyway, I'm extremely burnt out by this, and just want to get some opinions on what I should do.

Tl;dr I hate college but have invested a lot of time and money into a useless degree. I don't think I can graduate, but I don't know if I should stay or drop out.",college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9p4lgr/i_want_to_drop_out_but_i_dont_think_that_i_can/
1mk42rc,Medicine made me forget how to relax,"I am a 4th-year medical student (4/7), and I can't help but feel that I have forgotten how to relax,

I became obsessed with grades, extracurriculars, and research as I chase distinction. It's not all bad, though. I've achieved a 4.0 GPA, and I've had the opportunity to organize some of the biggest health events in the country. Furthermore, I've gotten myself published on Cochrane, with more proposals ready for submission.

And now 2 months into the summer vacation, something feels off.....

I feel like I can barely rest because I should be doing something with my time, so I've spent my whole summer doing apprenticeships and research proposals.

I feel like I'm constantly living on edge, I barely sleep, I have minimal interaction with my family, and as a result, I feel my health has significantly deteriorated.

I am wondering if anyone can share tips on how they manage their stress, because I don't think time management is an issue for me with the amount of load that I am dealing with. For some reason, I can't bear to have free time to myself as I feel guilty about not doing anything (learning, practicing etc..)

gtc680,Fully online 2020-2021 *cries*,"Hi all,

I posted this a few days back while upset, and got downvoted within seconds, so I took it down. Posting again as I need to own my feelings on this. 

I’ve recently discovered that my courses will be fully online for 2020-2021. 

To provide some context: I have two part-time, pro rata contracts in two colleges, one with an extremely heavy teaching load.  The latter institution already has full-time expectations of part-timers’ availability, making it a stressful post.  Pre-pandemic I was on the verge of quitting  because of serious workload vs pay concerns but now, while eternally grateful to still have a job, I’m stuck.

The thought of having to teach online for a full year, with the doubled (in my experience, at least) workload, new courses and associated stress, has me freaking out. I’m not certain I can manage it, either in terms of performing my duties adequately or maintaining my physical or mental health (both of which I struggle with, even in ordinary circumstances). After years of effort to keep myself from relapse following a mental health crisis, and just about succeeding, I’m worried that this is going to be the straw to break the camel’s back. I have just about managed these past two months, running on fumes, with the summer on the horizon keeping me going - I’m not sure if I could do this for an entire academic year, with no respite or promise of an approaching light at the end of the tunnel. I will have to put in huge work over the summer to design new courses and update old ones for online delivery, but as I’m on a 9-month contract I will be doing it unpaid. While I love what I do, I can’t afford to work for free - I need to do other work during the summer to tide me over financially. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting - I’m just filled with dread and despair looking at the year ahead and have a strong desire to run for the hills, although that’s neither an option for me nor something I’d ever inflict on my similarly-beleaguered colleagues!

I guess I thought y’all would understand the struggle.  I’m far from work-shy, but as a human I have physical, mental (and temporal!) limitations. I’m worried that next year is going to be hell.

For most of september and october I actually had a good schedule going, sleep was consistent, etc. After the procedure recovery and no meds everything got fucked, my sleep schedule was horrible due to me staying up to ungodly hours to do my stats work online with a friend (I eventually caught up, if it's worth anything), and just generally feeling slightly depressed for the first time in a long time.

8chotq,How do you keep going when you hit a physical and mental wall?,"I'm nearing the end of my first year (second semester) in a PhD program. While the first semester was definitely tough, it was an overall positive experience and I really enjoyed it. Things changed halfway through the second semester: the classes I'm taking now are a lot more brutal (in both subject matter and volume of work), the students I TA are more challenging to deal with, and I've gotten a bit deeper in my research and am hitting a lot of speed bumps with experiment success and juggling multiple projects.

Before, I didn't have a whole lot of trouble keeping up with all the demands. Now, with the end of the semester (and the imminent deadlines that go along with it), I'm starting to hit a wall, not only mentally, but physically as well. Thursday required me to be on campus for a 14-hour day between classes, group meetings, research, and TA duties, and I noticed how utterly and inhumanly exhausted I was. Friday, I was noticeably shaking and nauseous, and later in the day I got dizzy, short of breath, and finally ended up fainting. I went to a clinic, but they didn't find anything wrong and just told me to take it easy. I took Saturday as a free day and physically feel a lot better, but today I'm trying to get some work for classes done and I JUST. CAN'T. DO. IT. I managed a couple of hours and I'm already fried.

I feel I don't work harder than most of my colleagues (I do 45-55 hours a week on average, sometimes 60 if needed), and compared to some I know that work 7 am-10 pm, I'm downright lazy.

Going into my 5th year, the dept told us that we likely wouldn't get funding so I got a full time academic advising job (with lots of paid leave, a nice office, and understanding supervisors) to support myself.

I barely got anything done with my dissertation last year trying to adjust to the new job and my two advisors still giving me a lot of responsibilities with both of their undergrad labs. 

They've lightened up considerably this year and I'm more adjusted to my job but I still can't seem to get this done. I feel like I've been running on fumes for years and suffer greatly from executive dysfunction. One of my advisors said in my annual review letter that the faculty likely won't let me go into a 7th year without cutting back on or quitting my job altogether. That's not an option for me as I don't have anyone who can financially support me. Also, previous students have taken 7 years and the dept handbook says I have up to 8, so I guess I could make an appeal but I'm not sure how that would go.

I feel like I'm in the 11th hour and it's now or never. If I weren't 80% done with my proposal draft, I'd probably just go ABD since I really like my current field and will likely stay rather than going for a faculty position (I'd be teaching focused so the pay is about the same). I can't seem to get this damn draft done but, even if allowed to keep my income, I don't think I can do another year. My health is already suffering.

Like I said earlier, I have terrible executive dysfunction to the point where I neglect basic personal needs like eating, let alone pushing through anxiety and finishing a dissertation. I feel frozen in fear and completely out of gas. How do I push through this to finally finish?",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/17bgzsu/tips_for_trying_to_finish_dissertation_through/

16742eo,Advise for finalising my masters dissertation.,"Hello all.

Usually with something like this I'd contact my supervisors, but as of right now they are on summer leave.

Anyway, I am currently at the stage of my dissertation with about three weeks left where there aren't really any drastic changes being made. Overall I'm not overly happy with my work, but I never am, and I suspect a lot of people feel the same about the work that they do. I see it now as simply a matter of editing and re-reading etc.

Yet, I can't help but feel guilty. This dissertation has been far more turbulent than my undergraduate one. I've had to pivot and change the whole thing multiple times, and because of that I feel as though I owe it to myself to work all day every day until the deadline. Yet at the same time I am absolutely drained. Even sitting down to edit kills me.

Does anyone, past or present students, have any advice/guidance as to the best way to go about 'seeing out' the dissertation process whilst running on fumes? For context, I've always worked more hours per day than needed, and I didn't allow myself any days off besides maybe a handful. Now, however, I'm hardly meeting my revised hourly target per day (now four hours).

wfnn5y,Is it a red flag to only have passing clinical grades?,"MS3 here.  No other red flags, USMD, no failures or anything like that, and won't be applying to anything hypercompetitive.  Our preclinical grades were all p/f.  Step 1 was also p/f.  Good research and extracurriculars (I think). Honestly running on fumes.  I show up early and do my shit, my patients like me, and I tend to get good feedback from residents and attendings.  However, I just can't seem to score higher than a ""pass"" on shelf exams which drags my clinical grades down to pass as well.

I feel like I haven't properly felt ANY emotion in at least a few weeks, let alone passion for anything I'm learning or doing.

wgzweb,How do I get through my last sub-I,"Hey y'all. Old story of ""burned out med student,"" etc etc. Currently on my last 4th year sub-I, in a specialty I love at a program I've always really hoped I might end up in for residency, but having so much trouble mustering up the kind of excitement and energy I've brought to all of my other rotations. I'm suddenly dealing with these brutal intrusive thoughts that all of the attendings think I'm a dumbass and are just sort of refusing to give me feedback out of pity. I've always done well in my rotations and have historically gotten a lot of positive feedback in the clinical setting but I'm feeling so out of place and so small and just so damn tired. I also quite like constructive feedback--people being willing to tell you directly what I need to do better at is like the ultimate cheat code to learning--so I'm not just waiting for these attendings to compliment me. They simply won't give me feedback, and I have asked all of them for it in-person only to get shrugs. 

All I want to do is hike, backpack, and do my landscape photography. I've always known that medicine and the outdoors are my two big life pillars. The past two years have practically eliminated my time outside and I feel like half of myself is just being extinguished. At first it was tolerable and I was able to get my fix with online content, activity-specific gym training, and the rare trip when I had some time off, but now when my phone periodically sends me reminder photos of old trips in wild places, I literally start to tear up and have to stop and take a breath so I don't burst into tears. Maybe sounds a bit dramatic to some folks, and that's cool, but maybe some of y'all can relate. I feel trapped, and then when I do have days off I have other responsibilities or things to work on that prevent me from getting outside, so there's just no escape.

I used to be this interesting person who knew interesting things about the world, had a ton of hobbies, was surrounded with good friends, read books like it was drinking water, and was backpacking multiple times every month in incredible, beautiful places. I was strong, happy, passionate, curious, and social. Right now I feel like a dried out watermelon rind left on a sidewalk. 

I do think this is a little depressive episode, and my family and I have discussed the possibility that I have a touch of cyclothymia in the past (also have a brother with bipolar I), though typically my cycles are minor, short, and infrequent enough that medicating isn't worth the trouble or any long-term regimens. Never had a major depressive episode or mania. Once I'm through this month I'm diving into ERAS more seriously, but also moving on to a series of fun electives that give me a lot more time and flexibility--plus will be able to take a few months off entirely during interview season so I can focus on those while doing as much outdoors stuff as I can.

So I really think I just need to get through these next three weeks. I have a couple of hikes lined up soon on days off and am hopeful that will help me get through the month. Curious if anyone has any insight into generating a second wind or finding one last pocket of gas when they're running on fumes, or even mantras you reach for when you need help getting across a finish line?

9c7ey4,I think I chose the wrong major and now I'm stuck in it,"Hey guys. I've just begun my third year in Nursing. I always liked the idea of Nursing because I always thought of it as something I could probably do and enjoy because I'd feel like it's a meaningful career. I was actually supposed to start my third year last year, but dropped because of depression. I'm feeling better now and thought I was ready to take school on again and managed to get accepted into the competitive program a second time. 

It's only been 2 week and I'm already extremely overwhelmed. I have to study every single day for hours and it just isn't humanly possible to 100% understand all the info and store it in the very very limited around of time they give us to do it. I feel like I have no life and 1000 worries. I'm sitting down most the day and by the 6th hour I'm burnt out and running on fumes. At that point I have to stop because then whatever I'm reading/writing isn't being absorbed at all so I just end up getting more tired for no reason. The professor's expectations are unrealistic and they all expect us to study hours every day for their classes, and the lab professors expect us to come often every week on our off time to practice skills. In what time is this possible? I take my time to study because I want to actually understand what I'm reading, but that doesn't work because it takes too much time I don't have for the rest of the assigned readings.

I am pretty good at time management, but this is insane and has already exhausted me. It occurred to me the perhaps somebody who truly wanted this career badly would be able to push through. I managed to do so the first 2 weeks but now as I eye the workload for the upcoming third week along with the 2 tests I have to somehow make time to study for the 4th week, I feel doubtful. I've realized that maybe I don't really want this. Maybe I liked the idea of it but not the actual practice.

I have no idea what else I would want to do, to be honest. The only thing that comes to mind is elementary school teacher, but I'm not even sure of that. It makes me sad to realize that I never really felt passionate about anything. But even if I knew what I wanted to do, I wouldn't be able to back out of these classes because it's too late to drop without financial liability. I can't afford to pay it. I've already made my poor parents pay too much just to get into this program and I'm not asking for more. 

I feel like I'm stuck in this intense program that I'm not sure I even like because of money. Then if I attempt to push through there's always the risk of me failing especially now that I've realized I might not want this, my motivation will be very low. Ugh I don't know what to do.

1gulfr8,Struggling and depressed as a math phd (help),"
Just another rough day. I am currently a math PhD in Purdue.

The hardest part of being a math PhD student is losing motivation.

When I started my PhD journey, I hoped to eventually secure a place at an academic institution.

However, as time went on, I realized that I’m just an ordinary person. I should have realized this sooner, but I guess I was lying to myself.

It’s not that I can’t finish my PhD—that’s exactly why I’m struggling. I could finish it, but then what? Would my talent be enough to support further academic development? I’ve lost the passion at the beginning.

Another frustrating part of being a math PhD student is the limited career options in industry. I searched online, but the information wasn’t encouraging. If I were in computer science or engineering, at worst, I could simply find a job. But with a math PhD? Jobs like quant roles only prefer people from top schools, and software development requires a computer science background. Even if I finish the PhD, I still might not find a decent job. I have lost the motivation to finish the PhD 

This is what I call a math diploma dilemma: if you quit, you lose almost everything; if you stay, you gain almost nothing.",PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1gulfr8/struggling_and_depressed_as_a_math_phd_help/
18y7khg,Is it possible to change field for PhD?,"Hi there,

I am currently doing my Master's degree in biomedical engineering. I discovered that doing science in academia can be extremely difficult (budget and time restrictions, etc.), so I have lost the passion I had for my field.

I have been learning on my free time more about social matters and the current state of the world (global warming, threat of nuclear war, etc. ), and I feel a strong desire to learn and do something about it. So I thought, why not do a PhD on something related to humanity (anthropology, sociology, global studies, history, anything...) where I can spend most of my time reading and thinking about my interests. I do not really care about the degree, papers, conferences, etc. I only care about using most of time reading what I want. If I had a normal job, I could only do it on my free time, and that would be very demanding.

In short, how difficult is to be accepted in a humanities PhD program when my background is engineering?

Thank you

I originally came into college wanting to double major in bio and stats but dropped stats because I wanted to focus entirely on getting a good gpa for med school. About to end my sophomore year realizing my broke ass can't afford med school and another ~8 years of schooling. I've lost the passion and drive for it because of this.

277v9w,What do you do when you get in a rut?,"I'm a twenty something male working on my PhD in a scientific topic where my goal is to spend all my day sitting alone working on my research.

Lately I've been stuck in a rut of sorts.  At the beginning of the year, I broke up with my (now) ex fiancé and I felt horrible.  I don't feel horrible now, I really feel quite great romantically (I've been dating new people, etc...), and yet I feel the feeling of going to work and doing nothing has followed me into the months since my breakup.

It's the 3rd year of my PhD, and so I essentially mostly work alone.  I've been working on a paper, but to be honest, I have lost the spark about my topic.  I feel my current paper is not useful and don't know how to properly differentiate it from other work in the area.  My advisor is understanding and I do some work, but I've lost the passion I once had.  I have a real problem getting motivated and working all day like I used to, because it's a really demanding field, and I don't know how to wake up and just do it myself without having small defined tasks to do (or even what those tasks are).

So right now it feels like the steps are ""step one, find genius idea, step two execute genius idea.""  It's easy to waste time reading papers and playing around with ideas that go nowhere, but much harder to put pen to paper and work on an idea I no longer feel passionate about, or that I feel isn't useful for humanity.  I know ultimately I should just finish this paper so I can move onto something better, but there's a lot of anxiety that fi I do this, I'll have to work on the next thing, which will be even worse because it will be a follow up to this already lackluster idea.

And as a consequence I put minimal energy into it.  I find myself reading about topics I find truly world changing in an almost pornographic way, as in ""oh wow, if only I were working  on this!"" or ""boy howdy, they are lucky to work on this idea!""  Part of it is my reticence to admit to my advisor that I don't feel like our work is that good anymore, and that I've have to admit I've wasted my semester working on something that isn't that useful.

I feel this is a common problem, but my feeling of anxiety about my work spurs a continued lack of work because I fear I'll be doing nothing, and hence do nothing, which is obviously dumb.  But at this point, starting work seems like ""well there's so much to do I just feel overwhelmed how am I ever going to catch up?""",GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/277v9w/what_do_you_do_when_you_get_in_a_rut/
